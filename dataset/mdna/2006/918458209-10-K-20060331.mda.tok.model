our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in item a above and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide cable and wireless broadband access solutions through two business segments the cable solutions segment and the wireless solutions segment 
our products are designed to address four markets cable  telecommunication  utility and wisp 
although we are engaged to various degrees in these distinct markets  some of our core technologies overlap with our respective solutions 
our cable solutions segment includes products that are used to deliver telephony and data t e links to enterprise and cellular providers over cable s wireless hfc networks 
additionally  our spectrum overlay technology is used to expand cable operators typical hfc network capacity in the last mile by up to two times in the downstream and up to four times in the upstream 
our cable solutions segment includes the results of operations of xtend networks ltd  an israeli privately held development stage company  and its wholly owned  us based subsidiary  xtend networks inc collectively  xtend

prior to that time  shira operated in the software products segment 
the cessation of shira s operations represented a disposal of a business segment under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

see note to our annual consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our annual consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates  judgments and assumptions under different conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we determined these critical policies by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition revenues from the wireless solutions and cable solutions segments are derived from sales of products 
as of december   our revenues from services were not significant 
our products are generally off the shelf products  sold as is  without further adjustment or installation 
when establishing a relationship with a new customer  we may also sell these products together as a package  in which case the products typically are shipped at the same time to the customer 
we do not recognize revenue when our customers have the right of return or any additional services are not delivered 
we recognize revenues from our products when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred and customer acceptance requirements have been met  if any  and we have no additional obligations  c the price is fixed or determinable  and d collection of payment is reasonably assured 
our standard sales generally do not include customer acceptance provisions 
however  if there is a customer acceptance provision or there is uncertainty about customer acceptance  the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer acceptance 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires that long lived assets  including definite life intangible assets to be held and used or disposed of by an entity  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long lived assets is less than the carrying amount  we would recognize an impairment loss and would write down the assets to their estimated fair values 
employee stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations 
charges for stock based compensation represent the amortization of deferred compensation charges  which are based on aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of stock options  shares of restricted stock and purchase price of the underlying common stock on one hand versus the fair market value of the common stock on the other hand 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying stock options and the shares of restricted stock 
under fixed plan accounting  compensation cost is fixed  measured at grant date and is not subsequently adjusted 
under variable plan accounting  the measurement date occurs after the grant date and compensation cost is estimated and recorded each period from the grant date to the measurement date  based on the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the end of each period 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 establishes a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments  and encourages adoption of such method for stock compensation plans 
however  sfas no 
also allows companies to continue to account for those plans using the accounting treatment prescribed by apb no 
we have elected to continue accounting for employee stock options and shares of restricted stock according to apb no 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no

see recent accounting pronouncements 
inventories we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of the inventory and the reported operating results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional provisions may be required 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated our cost of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income only when the undervalued inventory was sold 
in accordance with our inventory evaluation policy described above  we recognized an inventory provision of approximately  during the year ended december  this provision includes a  provision for purchase commitments resulting from our need to order or build inventory in advance of anticipated sales 
we recognized these provisions to account for excess inventory resulting from longer than expected sales cycle and customer acceptance of our product 
short term investments we have designated our investments in debt securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  which is determined based upon the quoted market prices of the securities  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity until realized 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in interest income  net 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in our current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments as short term under short term investments  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date 
interest  amortization of premiums  accretion of discounts and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income  net 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair values of these investments below their cost basis is deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis  the current financial condition of the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us 
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r supersedes our current accounting for share based payment awards under apb no 
and requires that we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on fair value 
in march  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 
relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective transition method 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we recognize share based payment compensation expense based on fasb interpretation  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing  and we will continue to do so after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that we estimate the number of forfeitures expected to occur and record expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest 
as of the year ended december   we accounted for forfeitures as they accrue as permitted under then current accounting standards 
the cumulative effect of adopting the change in estimating forfeitures is not material to our financial statements for the year ended december  we expect that adoption of sfas no 
r will increase our stock based compensation expenses in the year ended december  by approximately  this estimate does not include the impact of additional awards which may be granted  or forfeitures which may occur  after december  and prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r

 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
sfas no 
also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  january  for us 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
we adopted fsp fas and fas as of december  results of operations revenues revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues derived from our wireless solutions segment were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues derived from our cable solutions segment were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our small revenue base for the year ended december  resulted from a slower than expected customer acceptance of products in our cable solutions segment  b longer than anticipated sales cycles and our customer s difficulty in securing available licensed spectrum in the united states and c realigning our geographic focus by pulling resources out of asia and the sub continent region 
the decrease in our revenues for the year ended december  compared to the revenues reported for the year ended december   mainly resulted from a the change in our strategic direction in favor of the utility and cable markets  and b the closing of our china office and our international sales department which had generated revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues did not change significantly during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the slight increase was primarily related to increased shipments of our products in the united states 
revenues from the sale of inventory previously written down to for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
our revenue is concentrated among relatively few customers  as set forth in the following table 
though our principal revenue generating customers are likely to vary on a quarterly basis  we anticipate that our revenues will remain concentrated among a few customers for the foreseeable future 
year ended december  customer a customer b customer c customer d customer e customer f cost reduction program in august  we implemented a cost reduction program whereby we reviewed the size and composition of our workforce and made adjustments after evaluating a variety of factors 
in connection with this cost reduction program  we reduced our workforce by approximately in the united states and israel 
we have recorded approximately  in a one time cash severance payment and related expenses 
this cost reduction does not require the termination of any contractual obligations or require us to incur other material associated costs 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
cost of revenues was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues included impairment and amortization of technology of   and  and inventory write downs of approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the inventory write down for the year ended december  included a  provision for purchase commitments resulting from our requirement to order or build inventory in advance of anticipated sales 
we took these provisions to account for excess inventory resulting from longer than expected sales cycle and customer acceptance of our products 
we believe it is possible that in the future we may sell some or even a significant portion of the written down inventory 
this belief is consistent with our experience in and subsequent years in which we sold inventory that was previously written down 
however  due to the fact that we cannot comfortably predict when  if ever  such inventory will be sold given the lack of visibility and lack of acceptable predictability into our sales cycle  we have determined that it is appropriate to record the above write down 
we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to fluctuate based on our product and customer mix  revenue level and inventory valuations 
cost of revenues does not include   and  related to inventories previously written down to during the years ended december   and  respectively  in november  our israeli subsidiaries entered into new lease agreements 
accordingly  our costs related increased for the year ended december  due to the relocation of the subsidiaries facilities in the second quarter of expenses related to leased facilities were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development our research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately   and of the expenses were from our cable solutions segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately   and  of the expenses were from our wireless solutions segment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel  facilities  equipment and supplies 
a majority of our research and development activities are carried out in our facility in israel 
these expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
we increased spending for our personnel  facilities and equipment to enhance our cable solutions segment efforts during the years ended december  and non cash expenses related to stock option grants to our research and development employees and consultants were   and and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in our research and development expenses related to the cable solutions segment for the year ended december  compared to expenses reported for the year ended december   resulted from the consolidation of xtend with our operations beginning july  in addition  research and development expenses increased as a result of an increase in workforce compared to the workforce as of december  and the increase of new projects  as a result of our efforts to diversify our business to the cable solutions segment in addition to our wireless solutions segment 
the cost of our facilities increased for the year ended december  due to the relocation of our israeli facilities in the second quarter of expenses related to leased facilities were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our research and development workforce will increase in future periods in order to meet our customer demands 
acquisition of in process research and development on june   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of xtend 
the projects allocated to in process research and development of approximately  represented the fair value of purchased in process technology for research projects that  as of acquisition date  did not reach technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we charged them to our consolidated statements of operations on the date of acquisition 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december   compared to sales and marketing expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs of sales and marketing employees  consulting fees and expenses for travel  trade shows  market research  branding and promotional activities 
the increases in the year ended december  reflect our efforts to increase our visibility in the utilities and cable markets 
sales and marketing expenses for our wireless solutions segment were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the expenses for our wireless solutions segment in the year ended december  compared to those in the year ended december  mainly were due to the closing of our china office and our international sales department 
the increase in expenses related to the wireless solutions segment in the year ended december  compared to those in the year ended december  was due to a an increase in sales efforts for our wireless products in china and other new markets  b an increase in our workforce and c increased expenses resulting from efforts to acquire new customers 
sales and marketing expenses for our cable solutions segment were approximately   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenses for our cable solutions segment in the year ended december compared to the year ended december  resulted from a the consolidation of xtend with our operations beginning july   b increased sales and marketing workforce compared to the workforce as of december   c increased expenses related to trade shows and promotional activities and d increased expenses related to new market potential and market research as part of our efforts to diversify our business to the cable solutions segment in addition to our wireless solutions segment 
our sales and marketing expenses for the cable solutions segment for the year ended december  included  accrued for a relocation bonus to an xtend employee paid in january and non cash stock compensation charges of   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing workforce will increase in future periods as we increase our efforts to penetrate the cable market and meet our customer demands 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these expenses  approximately   and were from our cable solutions segment and approximately   and  were from our wireless solutions segment in the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  sarbanes oxley act of related implementation  strategic and business development and legal 
non cash stock compensation charges included   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a increases in executive staff and professional fees for the cable solutions segment that were consolidated with our operations beginning july  and b increases in the cost of our facilities due to the relocation of our israeli facilities in the second quarter of these increases were offset by a decrease of general and administrative expenses resulting from a decrease in executive staff and professional fees for the wireless solutions segment 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a increases in salaries and professional fees  b increases in the cable solutions segment s general and administrative expenses and c internal expenses related to the xtend acquisition which were not capitalized to our xtend investment 
general and administrative expenses also included expenses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to an aircraft time sharing agreement through an unaffiliated third party management company  in connection with several charters of an aircraft for business travel for davidi gilo  our chief executive officer 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as we continue to implement internal controls over financial reporting relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and execute our strategic plans and business development efforts 
restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring income adjustments of  resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our stock  compared to  and  of restructuring expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the restructuring program that we undertook in resulted in income reported for the year ended december  from an adjustment with respect to variable stock compensation related to our former chief executive officer 
this former officer exercised the majority of his stock options in  accordingly  we no longer account for these stock options under variable plan accounting 
impairment and amortization of intangible assets on june   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of xtend 
as part of this acquisition  we a issued  shares of our common stock valued at  b paid approximately  for non competition agreements with certain xtend employees  c paid  to certain xtend option holders and employees for the cancellation of their xtend options  and d paid other related expenses of  in addition  we provided a promissory note in the principal amount of  originally payable on march  the promissory note 
as xtend was a development stage enterprise that had not yet commenced its planned principal operations  we accounted for the acquisition as an acquisition of net assets pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their relative fair values  and we recorded no goodwill 
as of the closing date of the acquisition  the tangible and intangible net assets acquired consisted of the following in thousands of u 
s tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed cash and cash equivalents  other current assets property and equipment  net current liabilities total net tangible assets acquired  intangible assets acquired existing technology  in process research and development  non competition agreements  exclusive sales agreement  workforce total intangible assets acquired  total tangible and intangible net assets acquired  payment made in cash including expenses payment made by issuance of common stock  total purchase price  the fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by a third party appraiser  based upon future expected discounted cash flows 
the amount allocated to in process research and development represents the fair value of purchased in process products or projects that  as of the acquisition s closing date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  they were charged to our consolidated statements of operations as of such date 
intangible assets acquired are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows existing technology acquired in the xtend acquisition over six years  non competition agreements over approximately three years  exclusive sales agreement over four and one half years and workforce over one year 
amortization of intangible assets acquired for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  consisting of the amortization of existing technology of  and  non competition agreements of  and  an exclusive sales agreement of  and  and workforce of  and  respectively 
on december   we amended key provisions of the promissory note including the following a the maturity date was extended by one year from march  to march   and b the provision that would have allowed the holder to accelerate the promissory note if the sum of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivables  net of short and long term debt  was less than  on december  or june  was waived 
we determined that  as of the time of the amendment of the promissory note and immediately prior to its amendment  the contingency had been resolved and  therefore  we recorded  as additional consideration paid in the acquisition 
this resulted in an increase to the intangible assets acquired 
our current focus is on the residential market for msos  rather then the commercial market for msos  which was our prior focus at the time we acquired xtend 
this change in focus will require us to invest additional efforts in the development of suitable technology and products 
given this change in focus  and in conjunction with our ongoing review of the carrying value of our intangible assets  we determined that  in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment test of intangible asset is required 
the fair value of the intangible assets was estimated by management with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser  based upon future expected discounted cash flows as of december  based on this appraisal  by using a weighted discounted cash flow model for the estimation of a fair value of group of assets as set forth in sfas no 
 together with other facts and circumstances  we decided to record an impairment charge of  related to the full remaining carrying value of the intangible assets as of december  for additional information  see notes and of our annual consolidated financial statements 
gain resulting from amendment of promissory note in addition to the impairment performed on the acquired intangible assets  we estimated the fair value of the amended promissory note at approximately  and recorded this amount as a long term liability under promissory note in our consolidated balance sheet 
the  difference between the value of the amended promissory note and the original promissory note was recorded as gain resulting from amendment of to promissory note in the consolidated statements of operations 
in future periods we will record an accretion to the value of the amended promissory note up to  this accretion of  will be recorded as finance expenses during the remaining term of the promissory note  unless the note is cancelled 
for additional information  see notes and of our annual consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net interest income  net included interest from investment income and foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses 
net interest income decreased to  in the year ended december   compared to  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction of interest income for the year ended december  resulted from less cash and investments   of realized losses from the sale of debt securities before their maturity and an other than temporary investment impairment of  our recognition of the other than temporary investment impairment is due to the effect of rising interest rates on our fixed interest debt investments that potentially may not be held until maturity 
our interest income is derived from our cash and short term investment balances 
we will incur interest expenses in the year and beyond due to long term debt related to our financing with goldman  sachs co 
in which  of the proceeds bear an annual interest rate of up to  and the amortization of deferred expenses including the value of the warrant to purchase shares of our common stock attached to a portion of such long term debt incurred as part of the financing 
interest expenses will also be increased by the accretion to the value of the amended promissory note delivered to a former xtend shareholder  as part of the acquisition of xtend 
accretion of  will be recorded as finance expenses during the remaining term of the promissory note  unless such promissory note is cancelled 
income taxes our tax rate reflects a mix of the united states federal and state tax on our united states income and israeli tax on non exempt income 
as of december   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which will expire between through we have net operating losses of approximately  expiring in the years through the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations if there has been a significant change in ownership 
such a change in ownership  as described in section of the internal revenue code  may substantially limit our utilization of the net operating losses 
as of december   our israeli subsidiaries  excluding shira computers ltd 
shira  had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  the israeli loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
our israeli subsidiaries have been granted approved enterprise status for several investment programs 
the approved enterprise status entitles these subsidiaries to receive tax exemption periods  ranging from two to six years  on undistributed earnings commencing in the year in which the subsidiaries attain taxable income 
in addition  this approved enterprise status provides a reduced corporate tax rate of between to as opposed to the usual israeli corporate tax rate of for for the remaining term of the program on the plan s proportionate share of income 
since our israeli subsidiaries have not achieved taxable income  the tax benefits periods have not yet commenced 
the subsidiaries losses are expected to offset certain future earnings of the subsidiaries during the tax exempt period  therefore  the utilization of the net operating losses will generate no tax benefits 
accordingly  deferred tax assets from such losses have not been included in our annual consolidated financial statements 
the entitlement to the above benefits is conditioned upon the subsidiaries fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the law  regulations published thereunder and the instruments of approval for the specific investments in approved enterprises 
one of our subsidiaries is taxed at the regular rate 
following a series of changes in israeli tax rates  the corporate tax rates for and thereafter are as follows      and for and thereafter 
on january   the israeli law for amendment of the income tax ordinance amendment no 
  as amended  known as the tax reform  came into effect 
the tax reform is aimed at broadening the categories of taxable income and reducing the tax rates imposed on employment income 
pursuant to these reforms  we have chosen  with respect to stock options granted under our plan  to grant to employees and office holders nosei missra of our subsidiaries who are israeli tax residents  in each case excluding controlling shareholders as such term is defined in section of the israeli income tax ordinance  options without a trustee intermediary 
this permits such employees and office holders  pursuant to the terms of the plan  to exercise their stock options and sell their shares without the holding period requirements and other restrictions imposed in the case of options granted through a trustee intermediary 
in the absence of a trustee intermediary  the tax reform generally permits such employees and office holders to recognize ordinary income at the time the employee actually sells the shares  rather than on the date of grant or exercise  but precludes us from deducting the resulting expense for tax purposes at any time 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state deferred tax assets as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured 
charges for stock based compensation charges for stock based compensation represent the amortization of deferred stock compensation charges which are based on the aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of stock options and the purchase price of the underlying common stock at their dates of grant or sale and the deemed fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes 
deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the stock options 
for the year ended december   net income related to stock based compensation was  compared to expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the stock based compensation charges resulted from a a separation agreement including income adjustments of  for the year ended december  and expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with the termination of our former chief executive officer recorded as a restructuring adjustment and b stock option grants to service providers and employees accounted for on the fair value based method 
the charges for stock compensation relating to the continuing operations are as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative charge for restructuring  we expect that adoption of sfas no 
r will increase our stock based compensation expenses in the year ended december  by approximately  this estimate does not include the impact of additional awards which may be granted  or forfeitures which may occur  after december  and prior to our adoption of sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  during the year ended december  we settled all severance expenses and termination of contractual obligations as of december  amounting to on march   we sold all of our shares of shira stock to third parties the shira purchasers 
the shira purchasers are required to pay us to of the proceeds that may be received upon the subsequent sale by the shira purchasers of shira or its assets 
the shira purchasers assumed all liabilities of shira totaling  we recorded a  gain from this sale in discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we received an additional  from the shira purchasers 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations principally through bank borrowings and equity sales of our common stock for approximately  as of december   through open market transactions  we repurchased  shares under the repurchase program for a total of  we did not repurchase shares under such program during and have no present intention of doing so in we have experienced net operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  cash used in operations was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was  of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
on march   we completed a financing with goldman  sachs co 
further described below in subsequent events 
the closing of the financing resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately  we believe this cash  coupled with our anticipated cash flows used for operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a substantial portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in the event of an increase in inflation rates in israel  or if appreciation of the nis occurs without a corresponding adjustment in our dollar denominated revenues  our results of operation and business could be materially harmed 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  substantially all of these amounts consisted of corporate and government fixed income securities and money market funds that invest in corporate and government fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
while most of our short term investments are classified as available for sale  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we may not be able to obtain similar rates after maturity as a result of fluctuating interest rates 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures
