item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
at december   we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired to date  we have sold clinics  closed facilities due to substandard performance  and consolidated four clinics with other existing clinics 
in  we added new clinics including developed and acquired  closed and sold two 
in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
we bill third party payors for services at standard rates 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system does not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period so in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  historically the difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally been less than of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of 
table of contents subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis shows a less than difference between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ending december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding our accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable the following table presents our accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 
historically  of balances are reclassified into self pay from other categories primarily managed care  medicare and other after all expected payments are received from third party payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we periodically assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
in  we wrote off  of goodwill due to impairment based upon our annual analysis 
see note significant accounting policies goodwill in notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for minority interests 
in the majority of the company s partnership agreements  the therapist partner begins with a profits interest in his or her clinic partnership  which increases by at the end of each year thereafter up to a maximum of 
within the balance sheet and statement of net income  historically  the company has recorded therapist partner s profit interest in the clinic partnerships as minority interests in subsidiary limited partnerships 
the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb no 
and fasb interpretation no 
eitf  which provides specific accounting guidance relating to various incentive compensation issues 
for partnerships formed after january  whereby the therapist limited partner has minimal risk  eitf requires the company to expense as compensation rather than as a minority interest in earnings  the therapist partners interest in profits 
moreover  eitf requires that the company expense as compensation rather than capitalizing as goodwill  the purchase of minority interests in the partnerships for clinic partnerships formed after january  for partnerships formed after january   in which the therapist limited partner has made a substantial investment and has more than inconsequential risk  the minority interest is reported in the minority interests in subsidiary limited partnerships line item 
in accordance with the above  for the years ended december   and  we have expensed   and  respectively  of the minority interests in earnings of subsidiary limited partnerships relating to certain partnerships formed after january   as salaries and related costs 
at december   and    and  respectively  in undistributed minority interests related to those partnerships are classified as other long term liabilities 
this change in classification had no effect on net income at december   and but rather resulted in a reclassification from minority interests in earnings to salaries and related costs

table of contents the following table details the amount expensed relating to minority interest and profit share bonus arrangements with therapist limited partners and directors in thousands minority interest pre january partnerships minority interest post january partnerships profit share bonus total reported as minority interests in subsidiary limited partnerships in the statements of net income 
includes minority interests for partnerships formed prior to january  and those partnerships formed after january  in which the therapist limited partner has made a substantial investment and has more than an inconsequential risk 
expensed as clinic operating costs salaries and related costs in the statements of net income 
selected operating and financial data the following table presents selected operating and financial data 
we view the non financial data points as key indicators of our operating performance 
in particular  we view average visits per day per clinic as a material component of our operating performance 
as indicated below  the number of daily visits to our clinics has declined from an average of per clinic during to an average of per clinic during for the years ended december  number of clinics  at end of period working days average visits per day per clinic total patient visits net patient revenue per visit statements of operations per visit net revenues salaries and related costs rent  clinic supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts gain loss on sale or disposal of fixed asset closure costs and impairment charge contribution from clinics corporate office costs operating income results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal net revenues rose to million from million primarily due to a increase in patient visits to million and an increase of in net patient revenues per visit to 
net income increased to million from million

during  the company acquired five clinics which accounted for million of the million 
the remaining increase of million in net patient revenues was from mature clinics 
net patient revenues are based on established billing rates less allowances and discounts for patients covered by contractual programs and workers compensation 
net patient revenues reflect contractual and other adjustments  which we evaluate monthly  relating to patient discounts from certain payors

the allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each period is based on a detailed  clinic by clinic review of overdue accounts and is regularly reviewed in the aggregate in light of current and historical experience 
the accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to days at december  as compared to days at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of accounts being billed electronically thereby shortening the collection period and a concentrated effort by management to collect or write off older receivables 
receivables in the amount of million were written off in both and closure costs and impairment charge in  a charge of  was taken related to clinic closures which occurred in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of the charge primarily consisted of an additional  accrual for lease commitments and other costs related to the clinics closed in the third quarter of and  for clinics closed in the fourth quarter of in  goodwill in the amount of  was written off

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that our business is generating enough cash flow from operating activities to allow us to meet our short term and long term cash requirements 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december   a decrease of 
although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics  and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  future clinic development and investments 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund and million in investments which include short term high grade commercial paper credit rating of a p or better  municipal obligations and government sponsored enterprise investments 
the decrease in cash of million from december  to december  was due primarily to cash used in investing activities of million and in financing activities of million offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
our primary uses of cash included million for acquisitions excluding seller financing of  million for the purchase of fixed assets  million for the purchase of minority interests of limited partnership interests in certain of our clinic partnerships  million for the repurchase of the company s common stock  and million for distributions to minority investors in subsidiary limited partnerships 
during  the exercise of stock options generated million in cash to the company and resulted in a related tax benefit of  the company makes reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect its accounts receivable  including applicable deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor types 
claims are submitted to payors daily  weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor s requirements 
when possible  we submit our claims electronically 
the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect 
medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency approval initially may not be submitted for to months 
when all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted  accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms 
with managed care  commercial health plans and self pay payor type receivables  the write off generally occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for days 
our current ratio decreased to to at december  from to at december  the decrease in the current ratio is due primarily to funds being used for acquisitions  the repurchase of the company s common stock and an increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payroll payments 
beginning january   all employees are paid every two weeks with a one week lag which resulted in a larger payroll accrual at december  we have future obligations for debt repayments and future minimum rentals under operating leases 
the obligations as of december  are summarized as follows in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter notes payable employee agreements operating leases total effective september   the company entered into an unsecured credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which matures on september   allows the company to borrow funds not to exceed at any one time an outstanding principal balance of  commitment 
the outstanding balance bears interest  at the company s option  at a rate per annum equal to either the prime rate  as defined in the agreement  or the adjusted libor rate  as defined in the agreement  plus three quarters of one percent 
the company is required to pay a commitment fee  which is paid quarterly in arrears  of per annum on the 
table of contents daily average difference between the commitment and the outstanding balance 
to date  there have been no borrowings by the company under this credit agreement 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them  which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and make additional acquisitions in select markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of minority interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash  notes or common stock 
we believe that existing funds and the availability of funds under the credit agreement  supplemented by cash flows from existing operations  will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs  development plans and any purchases of minority interests through at least march in conjunction with the hamilton acquisition  we entered into a note payable with the sellers in the amount of  payable in equal quarterly principal installments of  beginning september   plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
interest accrues at a fixed rate of per annum 
all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding is due and payable on the third anniversary of the note  may  the purchase agreement also provides for possible contingent consideration of up to  based on the achievement of a certain designated level of operating results within a three year period following the acquisition 
in addition  we entered into a year lease for each of the three facilities 
in conjunction with the excel acquisition  we entered into a note payable with the sellers in the amount of  payable in equal quarterly principal installments of  beginning april   plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
interest accrues at a fixed rate of per annum 
all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding is due and payable on the third anniversary of the note  december  the purchase agreement also provides for possible contingent consideration of up to  based on the achievement of a certain designated level of operating results within a three year period following the acquisition 
in addition  we entered into a year lease for one of the facilities and assumed a lease expiring september  on the other facility 
in september  the board authorized the company to purchase  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to  shares of its common stock 
on february  and on december   the board authorized share repurchase programs of up to  and  additional shares  respectively  of the company s outstanding common stock 
on august   the board authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to  additional shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
as of december   there are  shares remaining that can be purchased under these programs 
there is no expiration date associated with these share repurchase programs 
thus  additional shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions 
shares purchased are held as treasury shares and may be used for such valid corporate purposes or retired as the board considers advisable 
during  the company purchased  shares of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate of million 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases for its executive offices and clinic facilities discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recently promulgated accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued revised sfas  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting 
table of contents period 
sfas r requires that the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
currently  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period of the company s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  for the company  sfas r is effective for its first quarter which begins january  sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas and sfas prior to october   the company utilized black scholes  a standard option pricing model  to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
the black scholes model does not contain the interaction among economic and behavioral assumptions 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
for the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the trinomial lattice model was the best available measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
the trinomial lattice model accounts for changing employee behavior as the stock price changes  as behavior is solely represented by a time component 
the use of a lattice model captures the observed pattern of increasing rates of exercise as the stock price increases 
also  sfas r requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions attributable to the grant of stock options that are in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
the requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the company will adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
using the black scholes method of valuing stock options for options granted prior to october  and using the trinomial lattice model for those granted after october  and based on stock options granted to employees and directors through december   the company estimates that the adoption of sfas r will reduce net earnings by approximately  the future pre tax expense  based on the above described valuations  of the nonvested options is million to be recognized in through previously  in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas also amends certain disclosures under sfas and accounting principles board opinion no

it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects that the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
this accounting guidance states that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after  and not contemplated at or near  the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
the company is required to apply eitf issue no 
to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of this issue did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated statement of net income or consolidated balance sheet in the reporting period in which adopted or for those periods following adoption 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
fas requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
the rental costs shall be included in income from operations 
fas is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued 
the company does not believe that the adoption of fas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation  of which were opened and acquired in for those newly opened clinics  we incurred an operating loss in generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
generally  patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
based on historical performance of our new clinics  generally the clinics opened in would have favorably impacted our results of operations beginning in item a
