for example  our fiscal year ended january  is referred to as fiscal 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the accompanying notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview g iii designs  manufactures  imports and markets an extensive range of outerwear and sportswear  including coats  jackets  pants  suits  dresses and other sportswear items under licensed labels  our own proprietary labels and private retail labels 
our products are distributed through a broad mix of retail partners at a variety of price points 
our sales concentration has increased as sales to our ten largest customers increased from of our net sales in fiscal to of our net sales in fiscal we operate in fashion markets that are intensely competitive 
our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes  across multiple market segments  distribution channels and geographies  is critical to our success 
although our portfolio of brands is aimed at diversifying our risks in this regard  misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on our business 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to design products that are accepted in the markets we serve  source the manufacture of our products on a competitive basis  particularly in light of the impact of the recent elimination of quota for apparel products  deliver products in a timely manner and continue to diversify our product portfolio and the markets we serve 
we operate our business in two segments  licensed apparel and non licensed apparel 
the licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel brands licensed by us from third parties 
the non licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel under our own brands and private label brands 
the sale of licensed apparel has been a key element of our business strategy for many years 
as part of this strategy  we added several new fashion and sports apparel licenses in the past year 
we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution  for a wider array of products and at a variety of price points 
the sale of licensed product accounted for of our net sales in fiscal compared to of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal on july   we acquired the business of marvin richards 
marvin richards has been an outerwear manufacturer and supplier for over years under the marvin richards brand name 
as a result of this acquisition  we have licenses under the calvin klein and ck calvin klein brand names 
marvin richards also conducts a variety of private label programs 
on july   we also acquired specified operating assets of winlit group  ltd 
winlit has been a supplier of outerwear for over years 
as a result of acquiring winlit s assets  we have licenses for men s and women s outerwear under the guess brand  leather outerwear under the tommy hilfiger brand  and ladies outerwear under licenses with ellen tracy and pacific trail 
winlit also sells apparel under the winlit  lnr  and ny owned names and through private label programs 
the operating results of marvin richards and winlit have been included in our financial statements since july  as a result  our results for fiscal exclude the seasonal losses that were incurred by the acquired companies in the first half of fiscal results for fiscal will include the full year of operations of the acquired companies  as well as a full year of interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense relating to the acquisitions 
as a result  we expect that our seasonal losses in the first two quarters of fiscal will be higher than in fiscal these acquisitions are consistent with our strategy to increase the portfolio of brands that we offer through different tiers of retail distribution  for a wider array of products and at a variety of price points 
both transactions are expected to complement our existing group of licensed brands  g iii owned labels and private label programs 
we entered into a new financing agreement on july  to fund the purchase price for these acquisitions and provide additional working capital 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of this financing 
we continue to believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will continue to look for licensees with a successful track record of developing brands 
we are continually having discussions with licensors regarding new opportunities 
it is our objective to continue to expand our product offerings 
as a result of our acquisition of marvin richards  we have licenses for men s and women s outerwear with calvin klein 
in september  we entered into a license agreement to manufacture and distribute women s better suits under the calvin klein label and in april  we entered into a license agreement to manufacture and distribute women s dresses under the calvin klein label 
we began shipping the women s suit line in january and expect to begin shipping women s dresses for the holiday season 
we have had a license agreement with sean john for men s outerwear for over five years 
in march  we added license agreements to manufacture women s sportswear and outerwear under sean john labels 
we expect to launch the sean john sportwear line in we will also be producing a line of urban sportswear for wal mart under their exsto label with shipments expected to begin during the second quarter of fiscal significant trends that are affecting the apparel industry include the continuing consolidation of retail chains  the desire on the part of retailers to consolidate vendors supplying them  the increased focus by department stores on their own private label brands and a shift in consumer shopping preferences away from traditional department stores to other mid tier and specialty store venues 
there has also been significant downward pressure on average retail prices for many categories of apparel 
we have responded to these trends by continuing to focus on selling products with recognized brand equity  by attention to design  quality and value and by improving our sourcing capabilities 
we believe that our broad distribution capabilities help us to respond to the various shifts by consumers between distribution channels 
we also believe that our operational capabilities will enable us to continue to be a vendor of choice for our retail partners 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies employed by us  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and stock based compensation 
in determining these estimates  management must use amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer allowances and discounts  product returns  bad debt and inventory reserves  and carrying values of intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize a sale at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
we also act as an agent in brokering sales between our customers and overseas factories 
on these transactions  we recognize commission fee income on the sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
this income is also recorded at the time the merchandise is shipped 
net sales take into account reserves for returns and allowances 
we estimate the amount of reserves and allowances based on current and historical information and trends 
sales are reported net of returns  discounts and allowances 
discounts  allowances and estimates of future returns are recognized when the related revenues are recognized 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based on pre defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
an allowance for discounts is based on reviews of open invoices where concessions have been extended to customers 
costs associated with allowable deductions for customer advertising expenses are charged to advertising expenses in the selling  general and administrative section of our consolidated statements of income 
costs associated with markdowns and other operational charge backs  net of historical recoveries  are included as a reduction of net sales 
all of these are part of the allowances included in accounts receivable 
we reserve against known charge backs  as well as for an estimate of potential future deductions by customers 
these provisions result from seasonal negotiations with our customers as well as historical deduction trends  net of historical recoveries and the evaluation of current market conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories  assessing slow turning  ongoing product as well as fashion product from prior seasons 
the market value of distressed inventory is based on historical sales trends of our individual product lines  the impact of market trends and economic conditions  and the value of current orders for this type of inventory 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and intangible assets on july   we acquired marvin richards and specified operating assets of winlit 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life be tested for impairment at least annually 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are required to be written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is generally determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
significant estimates used in the fair value methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples of the reportable unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit over its estimated remaining useful life 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units 
we also consider our and our competitor s market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
we allocated the purchase price of the companies we acquired in fiscal to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimate fair values 
these valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include future expected cash flows from license agreements  trade names and customer relations 
in addition  other factors considered are the brand awareness and market position of the products sold by the acquired companies and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
if we did not appropriately allocate these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components  our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods  which will affect our net income 
stock based compensation effective february   we will account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting statements standards no 
r share based payments 
we will utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant 
the black scholes model requires subjective assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected life of options and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect management s best estimates 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and the amount of our stock based compensation expenses 
we estimate that that we will recognize approximately  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal with respect to stock options that were outstanding as of january  as of february   there was approximately  of total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted by us 
these expenses are expected to be recognized through january  results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of our net sales for the fiscal years indicated below

net sales of non licensed apparel increased million to million from million in the prior year

amortization expense increased as a result of the amortization of the identifiable intangibles of marvin richards and winlit that we acquired 
interest and finance charges  net were million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year

we had an income tax expense of million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflected the charge of  associated with the sale of our joint venture interest in a factory in china for which we did not record a tax benefit 
year ended january  fiscal compared to year ended january  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal net sales of licensed apparel decreased million to million from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased sales of our fashion sports apparel million  as well as a change in purchases this year by our largest customer from licensed products to our own proprietary brands a decrease of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of other licensed apparel  primarily cole haan and sean john aggregate increase of million 
net sales of non licensed apparel increased million to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of our largest customer buying outerwear under our own women s and men s labels rather than under licensed labels as was done last year an increase of million  as well as increased sales of our black rivet brand an increase of million  which was launched in fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal gross profit of licensed apparel was million of net sales compared to million of net sales in fiscal the decrease in gross profit  both in amount and percentage  in the licensed apparel segment for fiscal was primarily the result of the decline in sales in our higher margin fashion sports apparel business 
the gross profit percentage in the prior year was favorably impacted by a million decrease in our receivable reserves in the second quarter of fiscal which predominantly impacted our licensed apparel segment 
these reserves were established in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but were no longer deemed necessary as actual discounts and allowances were less than anticipated 
gross profit from non licensed apparel was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage in our non licensed apparel segment resulted primarily from lower commission based sales

design and product development expenses increased primarily due to more extensive sample development in our sports and black rivet lines and due to the newly launched cece cord division 
the increase in personnel costs was attributable to additional personnel hired in fiscal as well as increases in the cost of our health benefits  partially offset by decreased bonus expense compared to fiscal the decrease in sales commissions resulted from lower sales of fashion sports apparel which are made primarily by an outside sales force

liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are to fund our seasonal build up in inventories and accounts receivable  primarily during the second and third fiscal quarters each year 
due to the seasonality or our business  we generally reach our maximum borrowing under our asset based credit facility during our third fiscal quarter 
the primary source to meet our cash requirements are borrowings under this credit facility and cash generated from operations 
during fiscal  we also used million of cash to fund the purchase of marvin richards and specified assets from winlit 
we are required to make principal payments of at least million during fiscal under our new term loan 
in addition  we expect to use additional cash during the next three years to pay additional purchase price in connection with our two acquisitions based on the operating results of these two divisions in fiscal  and financing agreement on july   we entered into a financing agreement with the cit group commercial services  inc  as agent  for a consortium of banks 
the financing agreement is a three year  senior secured credit facility providing for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the facility consists of a revolving line of credit and a term loan 
this financing agreement replaced our prior financing agreement that was a revolving line of credit that provided a maximum line of credit in amounts that ranged from million to million at specific times during the year 
the revolving line of credit provides for a maximum line ranging from million to million at specific times during the year  provided that there are no borrowings outstanding for at least days during the period from december through april each year 
we have satisfied this requirement for the most recent period 
amounts available under the line are subject to borrowing base formulas and over advances as specified in the financing agreement

mandatory prepayments are required under the term loan commencing with the fiscal year ending january  to the extent of of excess cash flow  as defined 
the term loan bears interest  at our option  at prime plus at april  or libor plus at april  
the financing agreement requires us  among other things  to maintain tangible net worth at specified levels  achieve specified earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and maintain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios as defined 
it also limits payments for cash dividends and stock redemption to million plus an additional amount for stock redemptions based on the proceeds of sales of equity securities 
the financing agreement is secured by all of our assets 
pt balihides  our indonesian subsidiary  had a separate credit facility with an indonesian bank 
in december  we closed the manufacturing facility operated by this subsidiary 
the notes payable under this facility represent borrowings as of january  of approximately  the loan is collateralized by the property  plant and equipment of this subsidiary 
no other g iii entity has guaranteed this loan 
we continue to be in discussions with the bank regarding settlement of this debt 
cash from operating activities at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal cash was generated primarily from our net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization million and for shares of common stock issued as compensation million and a net decrease in inventory of million 
the decrease in inventory resulted from the sale of million of inventory that we acquired from marvin richards and winlit that was not on our balance sheet at the beginning of the year  offset  in part  by an increase of million in our year end inventory 
we realized cash from acquired accounts receivable of million during the year 
the cash generated from these items was offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales in the fourth quarter fiscal sales compared to the prior year 
the increase in prepaid expenses is primarily a result of contractual advance payments made to licensors in accordance with some of our license agreements 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generated  of cash from operating activities in fiscal  resulting primarily from a decrease in inventory of million and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense of million and the write down of  in our joint venture interest  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in inventory in fiscal resulted primarily from reduced fashion sports apparel inventory 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we had million of cash provided from our operating activities resulting primarily from net income of million  a decrease of million in inventories  and million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
the decrease in inventory was attributable to reduced inventory of leather skins associated with lower production of leather apparel 
cash from investing activities we used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal  primarily in connection with the acquisitions of marvin richards million and winlit 
we used the balance of million in investing activities for capital expenditures  primarily to renovate existing and additional warehouse space that we leased 
in fiscal  capital expenditures  which were primarily for leasehold improvements for office and showroom space and computer equipment  amounted to million  partially offset by the proceeds of  from the sale of our joint venture interest  resulting in a net use of  of cash for investing activities 
in fiscal  we used  of cash in investing activities to pay for capital expenditures 
cash from financing activities cash from financing activities provided million in fiscal primarily as a result of million of borrowing under the term loan that is part of our new financing agreement  offset in part by the repayment of million under our terminated credit facility and repayment of million under our new credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the term loan primarily to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions of marvin richards and winlit and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions and the new financing agreement 
as of january   there was million outstanding under the term loan 
cash flows generated by financing activities in fiscal were primarily from financing obtained under a capital lease arrangement  and the exercise of stock options 
we had  of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily due to  received in connection with the exercise of stock options  partially offset by  in payments of capital lease obligations 
financing needs we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations  together with funds available from our line of credit  are sufficient to meet our expected operating and capital expenditure requirements 
we may seek to acquire other businesses in order to expand our product offerings 
we may need additional financing in order to complete one or more acquisitions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing  if required  on acceptable terms or at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and foreign exchange our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we negotiate our purchase orders with foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuation in foreign currencies  our cost for any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed
