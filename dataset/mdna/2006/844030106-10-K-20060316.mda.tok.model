for additional information related to the company s lines of business  locations of operations and services provided  see item business 
business strategy the company s strategy is focused on achieving profitable growth and enhancing stockholder value 
the key elements of its strategy include the following effectively managing the company s substantial base of energy infrastructure assets 
southern union will continue to focus on increasing utilization and cost savings while making prudent capital expenditures across its base of interstate transmission assets 
since the company s acquisition of panhandle energy and cce holdings acquisition of crosscountry energy  the company has been successful in reducing costs while integrating back office and support functions within the company 
further  southern union will continue to focus each of its regulated operating units on meeting their allowable rates of return by managing operating costs and capital spending  without sacrificing customer safety or quality of service 
when appropriate  the company will continue to seek rate increases within its interstate transmission and gas distribution operations 
maintaining an investment grade rating and credit profile while growing the business 
the company will continue to pursue opportunities to enhance its credit profile through further diversification of both regulated and unregulated cash flow and earnings sources and reduce its ratio of total debt to total capital over time in order to strengthen the company s balance sheet and financial flexibility 
in this regard  southern union s acquisition of panhandle energy in june  cce holdings acquisition of crosscountry energy in november and the acquisition of the sid richardson energy services business in march diversified the company s regulated and nonregulated cash flow and earnings sources 
in addition  the company s use of common stock  preferred stock and equity units offerings and use of free cash flow has reduced the company s indebtedness and enhanced its financial strength 
expanding through development of the company s existing businesses 
to complement the organic growth of its existing operations  the company will continue to pursue growth opportunities through the expansion of its existing asset base

selectively acquiring businesses primarily within the natural gas industry 
the company s strategy for long term growth includes acquiring assets that will position it favorably in the evolving north american natural gas markets 
consistent with the company s acquisition of panhandle energy  cce holdings acquisition of crosscountry energy and the march  acquisition of the sid richardson energy services business  the company will continue to evaluate opportunities within the north american energy sector that will optimize stockholder value 
as part of that evaluation  the company seeks to balance its ability to integrate newly acquired assets with its ability to maintain an investment grade rating while providing growth in earnings and cash flow 
results of operations overview the company believes that its acquisition of panhandle energy on june  and cce holdings acquisition of crosscountry energy on november  represent significant steps undertaken by the company in its transformation into a higher return business with significant growth opportunities 
the acquisitions which comprise the transportation and storage industry segment for the company contributed percent  percent and percent of the company s total segment ebit for the year ended december   after excluding the impact of the million goodwill impairment charge in  the six month period ended december  and the year ended june   respectively 
as of december   the company s operating business segments were transportation and storage and distribution 
these segments provided a variety of energy services including the interstate and intrastate transportation and storage of natural gas  lng terminalling and regasification services and the local distribution of natural gas 
see item business business segments 
effective with the acquisition of the sid richardson energy services business in  the company will report a new gathering and processing business segment 

table of contents the company evaluates segment performance based on several factors  of which the primary financial measure  beginning january   is earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
evaluating segment performance based on ebit is a change from utilizing operating income in prior periods 
due to the significance of the operating results of the company s november investment in cce holdings  the operating results of which are included in earnings from unconsolidated investments  management felt that ebit would allow management and investors to more effectively evaluate the performance of all of the company s consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investments 
ebit may not be comparable to measurements used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or operating cash flow 
the following table provides a reconciliation of ebit by segment to net earnings available for common stockholders 
due to the company s change in its fiscal year end  certain unaudited periods are presented to facilitate a meaningful comparison of financial results between periods 
year ended december  six months ended december  years ended june  unaudited unaudited in thousands ebit transportation and storage segment distribution segment corporate and other total ebit interest dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust earnings from continuing operations before income taxes federal and state income taxes net earnings from continuing operations net earnings from discontinued operations preferred stock dividends net earnings available for common stockholders year ended december  versus the year ended december  the company s million decrease in earnings was caused by the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of million resulting from the executed agreements for the sale of its pennsylvania and rhode island natural gas distribution businesses 
excluding this charge  earnings would have improved by million 
the improvement is primarily due to realization of the full year of operating results from cce holdings  cost sharing synergies split between southern union and cce holdings related to the november  acquisition of crosscountry energy  and the mpsc base revenue rate order authorization applicable to missouri gas energy 
additionally  decreases in operating expenses in both the transportation and storage and distribution segments were realized  partially offset by higher depreciation expense 

table of contents six month period ended december  versus the six month period ended december  the company s million decrease in earnings was primarily caused by a charge for the impairment of the company s investment in a technology company  increases in operating expenses in the distribution segment  primarily due to environmental site remediation and increased bad debt expenses  and an increase in preferred stock dividends 
such decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings from unconsolidated investments related to the investment in cce holdings on november  and a decrease in income tax expense 
year ended june  versus the year ended june  the company realized million of improved earnings for the year ended june  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of operating results from its june  acquisition of panhandle energy 
business segment results transportation and storage segment 
the transportation and storage segment is primarily engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas from gas producing areas in texas  oklahoma  colorado  and the gulf of mexico and the gulf coast to markets throughout the midwest  southwest to california and to florida  and also provides lng terminalling and regasification services 
its operations are conducted through panhandle energy and its equity investment in cce holdings and are regulated as to rates and other matters by ferc 
the transportation and storage segment operations are somewhat sensitive to weather and are seasonal in nature with a significant percentage of annual operating revenues and net earnings occurring in the traditional winter heating season 
historically  much of the company s business was conducted through long term contracts with customers 
over the past several years some of the company s customers have shifted to shorter term transportation services contracts 
this shift  which can increase the volatility of revenues  is primarily due to changes in market conditions and competition with other pipelines  new supply sources  changing supply sources and volatility in natural gas prices 
however  changes in commodity prices and volumes transported do not generally have a significant short term impact on revenues because the majority of the transportation and storage segment revenues are related to firm capacity reservation charges

risk factors risks that relate to the company s transportation and storage segment  and item business business segments transportation and storage segment  respectively 
the company s regulated transportation and storage businesses periodically file for changes in their rates which are subject to approval by ferc 
changes in rates and other tariff provisions resulting from these regulatory proceedings have the potential to negatively impact the company s results of operations and financial condition

year ended december  versus the year ended december  the million ebit improvement is primarily due to the realization of a full year of equity earnings in  totaling million  from the company s investment in cce holdings versus million recognized in additional ebit improvements in compared with at panhandle energy were primarily related to the following items higher transportation and storage revenue of approximately million primarily due to o an million increase on panhandle eastern pipe line  reflecting higher average reservation rates on new contracts  o a million increase in trunkline reservation revenues primarily related to the pipeline loop facilities extending from the trunkline lng terminal  which went into service in the third quarter of o decreased commodity revenues on trunkline of million due to a reduction in commodity volumes of six percent resulting from lower market spreads  and o impacts of hurricane rita  which significantly reduced volumes flowing on sea robin and caused shutdowns of liquids production  resulting in approximately million of revenue decreases 
management estimates further revenue reductions of approximately million will be experienced in as a result of the hurricanes  plus an estimated million to million in lost opportunity revenues from delayed lng expansion in service dates which were affected by the hurricanes and other technical issues  higher lng terminalling revenue of million primarily due to expanded vaporization capacity and a base capacity increase on the bg lng contract  partially offset by lower volumes resulting from fewer cargoes  a reduction in certain administrative and operating expenses of approximately million primarily due to synergies associated with the workforce reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of associated with the integration of crosscountry energy  llc  a decrease of approximately million in operating expenses due to a change in vacation pay practice and a corresponding accrual reduction  a decrease of approximately million of benefit costs primarily due to headcount reductions and lower postretirement costs due to enactment of medicare part d reimbursements  incurrence of approximately million of severance related costs in associated with the crosscountry energy integration  and lower lng power costs of approximately million due to lower lng volumes received in 
table of contents the following items caused a negative impact in versus the higher net recovery of previously under recovered fuel volumes of approximately million in  higher expense of approximately million of damages directly associated with hurricanes katrina and rita  higher depreciation and amortization of million primarily due to normal property  plant and equipment growth of approximately million and a million acquisition adjustment recorded by southern union in reducing customer contracts value and related amortization  and an increase of million in property tax assessments related to higher utility income 
six month period ended december  versus the six month period ended december  the million reduction in ebit in the six month period ended december  versus the same period in was primarily due to the following items recognition of a million non recurring gain in on the early extinguishment of debt  reservation revenues were million lower in primarily due to the replacement of expired trunkline contracts during at lower average reservation rates than were in effect in due to market driven factors  lng terminalling revenues were million lower due to decreased volumes received  net commodity revenues increased in by million primarily due to higher parking revenue of million  partially offset by the impact of a six percent reduction in throughput volumes associated with a cooler winter during versus commodity revenues are dependent upon a number of variable factors  including weather  storage levels and customer demand for firm  interruptible and parking services  operating expenses were higher by million in primarily due to increased insurance and severance related costs of million and million  respectively  partially offset by the net over recovery of approximately million in of previously under recovered fuel volumes and a million reduction in contract storage expenses due to a reduction in contracted storage capacity  decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of million in versus was primarily due to preliminary purchase price allocations used in that were subsequently revised in  and realization of equity earnings from cce holdings of million for the period subsequent to the acquisition on november  year ended june  versus the year ended june  the ebit improvement of million is due to panhandle energy operating results being realized for the full fiscal year ended june  versus only days for the fiscal year ended june  distribution segment 
the distribution segment is primarily engaged in the local distribution of natural gas in missouri  pennsylvania  massachusetts and rhode island 
its operations are conducted through the company s three regulated utility divisions missouri gas energy  pg energy and new england gas company 
the utility divisions operations are regulated as to rates and other matters by the regulatory commissions of the states in which each operates

year ended december  versus the year ended december  ebit for the distribution segment improved by million in compared with after excluding the effects of the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the ebit improvement was primarily due to the following items net operating revenues increased by approximately million primarily due to missouri gas energy s higher average rates in based on the million mpsc base revenue rate order authorization in october  operating expenses were lower by million primarily due to the net deferral of approximately million of pension expense for missouri gas energy associated with the october mpsc rate order authorization and approximately million of lower bad debt expense primarily as a result of more aggressive collection efforts in  partially offset by approximately million of insurance costs primarily due to higher claims in  depreciation and amortization were higher by approximately million primarily due to normal growth in plant and the implementation of certain financial information systems in the first quarter of  and taxes other than on income and revenues were approximately million lower primarily due to property tax refunds for the years to received by missour gas energy during six month period ended december  versus the six month period ended december  the million ebit reduction for the six month period ended december  compared with the same period in is primarily due to the following items environmental site remediation costs were higher in the period by approximately million primarily due to mercury remediation costs at new england gas company  bad debt expense increased million resulting from the aging of higher customer receivables due to higher gas prices  outside service costs increased million in the period for costs related to increased collection agency fees  distribution system inspection fees and fees associated with sarbanes oxley documentation and compliance efforts  an increase of million in other net operating costs primarily due to general wage increases  increased overtime costs associated with distribution system maintenance and sarbanes oxley related costs  higher depreciation and amortization expense principally related to a charge of million taken in the period to write off certain capitalized software costs  in addition to normal plant growth  taxes other than on income and revenues  principally consisting of property  payroll and state franchise taxes  increased million  primarily due to a million increase in the period in property taxes in the company s missouri service territory 
such ebit reduction was partially offset by an increase of million in net operating revenue primarily due to increased sales volumes resulting from colder than normal weather in in the company s pennsylvania and new england service territories and the positive impact of the million annual increase to base revenues granted to missouri gas energy by mpsc  effective october  year ended june  versus the year ended june  the ebit reduction of million for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june  is primarily due to million of higher depreciation and amortization in related to plant growth and an increase in operating expenses of million  primarily due to the following items pension and other postretirement benefit costs increased million in the period primarily due to the impact of stock market volatility on plan assets  bad debt expense increased by million in the period due to higher customer receivables resulting from increased gas prices  and increased medical and insurance premiums of million and million  respectively
