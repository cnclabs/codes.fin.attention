overview criticare designs  manufactures and markets vital signs and gas monitoring instruments and related noninvasive sensors used to monitor patients in many healthcare environments 
the company sells its products both in the us and in international markets to customers such as hospitals  surgery centers  dental and physicians offices  and nursing homes 
criticare is implementing several business initiatives as part of its strategy to develop products for highly technical  growth oriented niche markets 
management believes that in order to be successful  marketing and sales partnerships in these areas are required 
that effort resulted in the execution of a number of oem agreements 
criticare is implementing several new business initiatives as part of its strategy to develop products for highly technicals growth oriented niche markets 
to capitalize on these business initiatives  modules and stand alone monitors were developed and marketed for specific oem customers 
the company views oem agreements as a critical component to our strategy to develop products for highly technical niche markets  and the oem business has been a significant driver of the company s growth with of total net sales in fiscal and of total net sales in fiscal the first of these initiatives involves monitoring products for anesthesia gases 
in fiscal  the company introduced an anesthesia monitoring product line for sale both under the criticare brand name and for sale to oems 
a second initiative is the development of a highly specialized monitoring system for medical imaging applications in an mri environment 
in  criticare entered into an agreement with medrad to jointly develop and exclusively sell a highly specialized medical monitoring product to medrad 
in july  criticare shipped the initial prototypes of this monitoring product to medrad and production shipments began in january medrad was the company s largest customer in fiscal and  accounting for and  respectively  of the company s net sales in those fiscal years 
following the acquisition  in july  of alaris medical systems  inc  a long time oem customer  by cardinal health  inc  the third initiative was implemented to develop an acute care distribution network in the us to sell to markets previously served through alaris 
following such acquisition  cardinal health exited the vital signs monitor business and signed a transition agreement with the company  which enabled our new acute care distribution network the opportunity to sell to the former alaris customer base 
in conjunction with the transition agreement  in september  we introduced a new portable cardiac monitor for the acute care market 
sales for the acute care market totaled approximately million during the introduction year of fiscal  approaching the largest revenue year criticare experienced under the alaris oem agreement 
fourth quarter net sales for fiscal of  were lower than the  in net sales for the same period of fiscal  principally due to the strong oem sales in fiscal the company had a net loss of  for the fourth quarter for fiscal as compared to net income of  for the fourth quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter of fiscal included a change of  to reserve a portion of a receivable from a distributor in mexico 
for the full year  the company had net sales of  in fiscal and net income of  compared to net sales  and a net loss  in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of net sales 
percentage of net sales years ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering administrative total loss from operations interest expense interest income foreign currency exchange gain loss other income income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales increased  to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase resulted from a increase in the number of units shipped  a increase in the average sales price per unit and a increase in accessory sales in the current year 
the increased sales were in part the result of  in acute care sales  which are a successful result of criticare s business initiative to develop an acute care distribution network in the us to sell to markets previously served through alaris 
additionally  the increased sales were driven by a  increase in international sales and a  increase in oem sales  which were partially offset by a  decrease in domestic sales during fiscal the international sales increased despite a  reduction of sales in india during fiscal the oem sales of  to medrad  for medical imaging applications  was partially offset by reduced sales of  to alaris  formerly our largest oem customer  during fiscal the decrease in domestic sales was due to a number of factors  including criticare s movement to exit the defibrillator market due to the continued trend of direct sales by defibrillator manufacturers rather than through an establish distribution network  the postponed sales of patient monitors awaiting the release of our next generation portable multi parameter vital signs monitor and the overall maturation of the oral surgery market 
oem sales in fiscal were  and represented of total net sales  compared to  of total net sales in fiscal the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal decreased from the generated in the prior year 
the margins decreased in the current period as the positive effect of a slight change in product mix was offset by the adverse effect of increased overhead costs associated with the manufacturing start up costs related to our new portable cardiac monitor and the portable multi parameter vital signs monitor  the replacement of a key supplier and with an upward shift in the fixed overhead costs to meet the increased quality and production demands of our oem customers 
charges to cost of goods sold for potentially obsolete inventory totaled  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this inventory is considered obsolete and will be disposed of and removed from criticare s warehouse during fiscal operating expenses for the year ended june  increased  from the same period in fiscal as an increase of  in sales and marketing and  in administrative expenses was partially offset by a  reduction in research  development and engineering expenses 
the increase of  in sales and marketing expenses was due mainly to a  increase in the commissions earned due to increased sales and a  increase in india operation expenses  combined with a  increase in advertising  trade shows and sales promotion and a  increase in license fees spending for the year ended june  in addition  due to the political climate currently in mexico and the age of the receivable  we are concerned that our distributor will be unable to complete a previously discussed tender with the mexican government  and as a result  we have reserved a portion of the receivable in the amount of  which has significantly increased our sales and marketing expenses 
administrative expenses increased by  mainly due to  in compensation expenses of which  was recognized in conjunction with stock options under sfas r  an increase of  in license fees and an increase of  in board of director fees  which was partially offset by a  reduction in legal fees and a  reduction in recruiting fees 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease of  in research  development and engineering expenses 
in the first quarter of fiscal  criticare received funding of  from our largest oem customer to jointly develop a highly specialized monitoring system for medical imaging applications  which reduced the research  development and engineering expenses for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june total other income for the fiscal year ended june  increased  from the same period in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the  received pursuant to a patent license agreement  an increase of  in royalty income and an increase of  in interest income 
the increase in other income was offset in part due to a foreign currency exchange loss of  related to the company s operation in india  which had a foreign currency exchange gain of  in fiscal the  and  increase in gross profit and total other income  respectively  partially offset by the increased operating expenses of  resulted in net income of  for the year ended june  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period in fiscal fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales decreased  to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease resulted from a decrease in the number of units shipped that was partially offset by a increase in the average sales price per unit and a increase in accessory sales in the current year 
the reduced sales were also the result of a  decrease in sales to alaris  formerly our largest oem customer  a  decrease in domestic sales and a  decrease in international sales during fiscal the international sales decrease was the result of a  order shipped in december  which increased international sales for the year ended june   without a comparable sale in fiscal the alaris oem sales decrease was offset by  of sales to medrad  our newest oem customer for medical imaging applications  in fiscal the decrease in domestic sales was due to a number of factors  including  of orders that were unable to ship by year end  the growing trend in the defibrillator market of direct sales rather than through an established distribution network  the postponed sales of patient monitors awaiting the release of our next generation portable patient monitor  the overall maturation of the oral surgery market  and to lost sales following the cancellation of three oral surgery shows  two oral surgery shows in florida and one oral surgery show in louisiana  as a result of the hurricanes during the first quarter of fiscal the lower unit sales and higher average sales price per unit were driven  in part  by a large shipment of pulse oximeters to supply a government tender in mexico in fiscal these units monitor pulse oximetry only and therefore carried a much lower average selling price than the company s equipment that monitors multiple vital signs parameters 
oem sales in fiscal were  and represented of total sales  compared to  of total sales in fiscal the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal decreased from the generated in the prior year 
the reduced margins in the current period were mainly a result of the decreased manufacturing overhead absorption due to the decrease in the number of units shipped against relatively fixed overhead costs 
charges to cost of goods sold for potentially obsolete inventory totaled  in fiscal which compared to  for fiscal this inventory is considered obsolete and was disposed of and removed from criticare s warehouse during fiscal total operating expenses in fiscal decreased by  from the prior year as a  increase in research  development and engineering expenses partially offset a  reduction in sales and marketing expenses and a  reduction in administrative expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a  decrease in the commissions earned by dealers and employees  a decrease of  in advertising  trade shows and sales promotion spending  a  decrease in operating supplies and a  decrease in payroll and related benefit expenses 
administrative expenses decreased by  mainly due to the cost containment efforts  including a reduction in consulting expenses of  a reduction in investor expenses of  and a reduction in business insurance premium expense of  in addition  bad debt expense of  was incurred in the prior year to write off the receivable due from an international distributor as compared to the current year 
total other income was  for the fiscal year ended june  which compared to total other expense of  for fiscal the increase in other income was due in part to a foreign currency exchange gain of  related to the company s operation in india 
moreover  other expense in the prior year included a  charge to settle a dispute with a customer  over a product installation  to avoid litigation 
the company elected to settle this issue rather than incur the significant legal and administrative costs deemed necessary to successfully defend its position 
other expenses in fiscal also included a  charge for the potential call of a standby letter of credit used to guarantee fund borrowings by an international distributor and a  charge to satisfy a claim for duties and value added tax associated with importation of products into a foreign country on behalf of the international distributor 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales returns  inventories  and warranty obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues and the costs of products sold are recognized as the related products are shipped or installed  if there are significant installation costs 
this revenue recognition policy is utilized for shipment of product to customers including both distributors and end users 
revenues derived from patent and intellectual property license agreements are recognized when both the delivery of the technology has occurred and all parties have signed the agreement 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable as well as historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency movements  and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company also maintains a sales returns reserve in order to estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and acceptances of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the timing of the company s revenue if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
the company maintains a reserve for obsolete inventory that it utilizes to write down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value 
the company determines the adequacy of the obsolescence reserve by considering historical annual usage of component parts and finished goods as well as assumptions about market conditions and forecasted demand 
when items are physically disposed of the amounts are written off against the reserve 
if future product demand is lower than expected or if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional charges to increase the obsolescence reserve may be required 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased  to  at june  due mainly to the disposal of obsolete inventory that had been reserved for in prior years 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased  to  at june  due mainly to the disposal of obsolete inventory that had been reserved for in prior years 
product warranty the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped based upon its historical experience providing warranty coverage 
the company s warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from current projections  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had a cash balance of  as compared with its fiscal year end cash balance of  the company has continued to maintain a bank debt free balance sheet 
the company has been able to increase its cash position by an aggregate of  over the last three fiscal years despite generating aggregate net losses of  during this period 
non cash expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense  provisions for obsolete inventory and provision from doubtful accounts decreased the company s profitability by an aggregate of  during the last three fiscal years  but did not impact the company s cash flows 
over the last three fiscal years the company has been able to fund  of cash used in operations and capital spending of  primarily with  of cash provided by the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal   of cash was generated from the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options  most of which were scheduled to expire in less than one year 
this cash partially offset the  of cash used in operations and the  of capital spending in fiscal cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily driven by the inventory investment in the new  next generation portable multi parameter vital signs monitor 
in fiscal   of cash was generated from the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and an additional  of cash was generated from the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock warrants  most of which were scheduled to expire in less than one year 
this cash partially offset the  of cash used in operations and the  of capital spending in fiscal in fiscal   of cash provided from the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options  most of which were scheduled to expire in less than one year  more than offset  of capital spending and  of cash used in operations 
the company believes all future capital and liquidity requirements will be satisfied by cash generated from operations  proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options  and its current cash balances 
no major capital equipment expenditures are expected in the company s next fiscal year ending june  the company also has a  line of credit currently in place that could be utilized  if necessary 
at june   there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
the credit facility has covenants which require minimum income or liquidity levels 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at june  this line expires in june the following table summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations at june  in the categories set forth below  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal periods total and thereafter operating leases capital leases contract manufacturing obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a demand line of credit facility with a commercial bank with interest payable monthly at basis points below the bank s reference rate 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this bank facility at june    and due historically to the lack of need to borrow from this credit facility and due to the company s current cash position  the company is not subject to financial risk on this obligation if interest rates in the market change significantly 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars  except for a small amount of net sales from the company s operations in india which are denominated in indian rupees 
as a result  part of the company s accounts receivable are denominated in rupees and translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the indian rupee would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  the company does not use any hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
