sales and marketing we sell our products through an international direct sales force with sales and or service offices in the united states phoenix  arizona  san diego and santa clara  california  manassas  virginia and boca raton  florida singapore  china  indonesia  the united kingdom  the netherlands  norway and russia 
our direct sales force consists of individuals supported by systems and applications engineers 
we focus direct sales activities on expanding our international sales by identifying emerging markets and establishing new customer accounts 
additionally  we directly target certain major accounts that may provide entry into new markets or lead to subsequent distribution arrangements 
international representatives  agents and systems integrators sell our products  supported by our sales and marketing personnel 
we supplement our direct sales force through the use of distributors and local agents who help develop sales leads and provide ongoing support 
typically  a member of our direct sales staff then assists in completing the sale 
generally  our distributors do not carry inventory of our products 
we participate in approximately trade shows each year 
we also generate new sales leads through advertising in trade magazines  direct mail  and our website

com we maintain a warranty department that also includes customer service and support staff that support customers and agents and provide installation supervision  if needed 
in certain instances  we use third party companies to install and maintain our products at customer sites 
customers our customers generally include national and international telecommunications providers including radio and television stations  digital television users including broadcast and cable networks  internet service providers  financial information providers  systems integrators  and other corporate entities and the us government 
our direct sales into principal foreign markets for the periods indicated consisted of the following percentages of total sales 

table of contents years ended december  region asia africa middle east latin america europe canada total foreign sales domestic in addition to the above sales  we believe that a substantial portion of our domestic sales are for products which ultimately are installed in foreign countries 
we believe that foreign sales will continue to make up a major portion of our total sales in subsequent periods 
we consider our ability to continue to sell our products in developing markets to be important to our future growth 
we may not  however  succeed in our efforts to cultivate such markets due to political or other factors 
see note significant customers and foreign and domestic sales for significant customers with or more of segment sales 
manufacturing we assemble and test certain products at our phoenix  arizona and san diego and santa clara  california facilities using subsystems and circuit boards acquired from subcontractors 
we obtain the remainder of our products  completely assembled and tested  from subcontractors 
although we believe that we maintain adequate stock to minimize the procurement lead time for certain components  our products use a number of specialized components or subassemblies produced by a limited number of suppliers 
in the event that such suppliers were unable or unwilling to fulfill our requirements  we could experience interruptions in production while we develop alternative procurement sources 
we maintain an inventory of certain chips  components and subassemblies to limit the exposure for such an interruption  and we believe that there are a number of alternative suppliers capable of providing replacements for the types of chips  customized components and subassemblies used in production 
however  there can be no assurance that this inventory is sufficient or that alternative suppliers can be secured quickly enough to prevent a significant interruption of our business 
for both segments  the company maintains an adequate supply of inventory based upon a master production schedule that is reviewed by management on a regular basis 
although there is not a firm forecast  the company takes into account current market trends and historical data to supply their product 
as of december   the company had backlog orders to be shipped in future periods of million in the satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment and million for the amplifier segment before eliminations 
the company s phoenix  san diego  and santa clara facilities were awarded iso certification  the international quality control standard for research and development  marketing  sales  manufacturing  and distribution processes 
subsequently  we have continued to improve our processes and methods of operations  consistent with our goals and the certification requirements 
this certification assists in increasing the acceptance of our products 
as of december  the company s iso certifications remain in effect 
intellectual property we rely on our proprietary technology and intellectual property to maintain our competitive position 
we protect a significant portion of our proprietary technology as trade secrets by relying on confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain suppliers 
we also control access to and distribution of confidential information concerning our proprietary information 
we also have patents  which protect certain of our proprietary technology 
we have been cautious in seeking to obtain patent protection for our products  since patents often provide only narrow protection that may not prevent competitors from developing products that function in a manner similar to those covered by our patents 
in addition  some of the foreign countries in which we sell our products do not provide the same level of protection to intellectual property as the laws of the united states 
we will continue to seek patent protection for our proprietary technology in those cases where we think it can be obtained and will provide us with a competitive advantage 

table of contents we also license proprietary technology from third parties under license agreements 
some of these agreements include royalty payments based on the number of units sold 
these agreements allow us to produce sufficient numbers of units to assure availability of all of our products as required by market demands 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including executive officers  manufacturing and operations personnel  research and development personnel  and selling  general and administration personnel 
these figures include employees who are based outside the united states 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory and in good standing

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the company s business 
the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
please note that additional risks not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business and operations 
we have a history of inconsistent operating results  and could suffer a reduction in profitability and even losses in the future 
as a result of operating losses from time to time in prior years  we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  while the company regained profitability during and continued to be profitable in and  we are in a highly competitive business and our profitability is dependent on growth in our markets  the continued introduction and market acceptance of our products  and management of our expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our earnings growth  maintain current earnings levels  or remain profitable at all 
we anticipate that earnings will be impacted by increased general and administrative expenses  including stock option expense and a higher tax rate  and could be impacted by margin pressures 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we anticipate that they could do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in our operating results  which may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
these fluctuating operating results derive from a variety of factors  including the following demand for our products  introduction of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors  growth of demand for internet based products and services in developing countries  timing of significant marketing programs we may implement  extent and timing of hiring additional personnel  competitive conditions in our industry  and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
the factors described above are difficult to forecast and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there have been recent years that have been challenging for the telecommunication and internet industries 
our business is somewhat seasonal  with the first quarter generally being the weakest  and the fourth quarter generally the strongest 
accordingly  we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenues for any future quarter 
we depend on international sales  which could cause our sales levels to be volatile 

table of contents a significant portion of business depends on sales to customers outside the united states 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for example  sales to foreign customers were approximately of total sales for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  additionally  we estimate that approximately of our domestic sales are eventually exported 
accordingly  we expect that our sales will continue to include a significant proportion of customers located outside the united states 
as a result of our dependence on foreign markets  the occurrence of any negative international political  economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
these shortfalls could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to be harmed 
some of the risks of doing business internationally include changing regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the exchange rate for the united states dollar  the availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  tariffs and other trade barriers  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  complex foreign laws and treaties  acts of terrorism  and difficulty of collecting foreign accounts receivable 
in addition  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act  which prohibits us from making payments to government officials and others in order to influence the granting of contracts we may be seeking 
our non us competitors are not subject to this law and this may give them a competitive advantage over us 
we depend on developing markets and their uncertain growth potential could result in a reduction in revenues and even losses 
we believe a substantial portion of the growth in demand for our products will depend upon customers in developing countries 
we cannot provide assurance that such increases in demand will occur or that prospective customers will accept our products 
the degree to which we are able to penetrate potential markets in developing countries will be affected to a large extent by the speed with which other competing elements of the communications infrastructure  such as other satellite delivered solutions  telephone lines  television cable  and land based solutions  are installed in these developing countries 
the sales and implementation cycles for our products are long and continue to increase  and we may incur substantial  non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that may not occur when anticipated  if at all 
a customer s decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
after a customer decides to purchase our products  the timing of their deployment and implementation depends on a variety of factors specific to each customer 
further  prospective customers may delay purchasing our products in order to evaluate new technologies and develop and implement new wireless systems 
throughout the sales cycle  we spend considerable resources educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
competition in our industry is intense and can lead to reduced sales and market share 
the markets for ground segment systems are highly competitive 
we have a number of major competitors in the satellite communications equipment field 
these include large companies  such as comtech efdata corp  paradise datacom  tandberg television  scopus  cpi communications power industries and miteq inc have significantly larger and more diversified operations and greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we possess 
as a result  these competitors may develop and expand their products more quickly  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products than we can 
competition from current competitors or future entrants in the markets in which we compete could cause us to lose orders or customers or could force us to lower the prices we charge for our products  all of which would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our products may become obsolete due to rapid technological change 

table of contents the telecommunications industry  including the ground based satellite communications systems business  is characterized by rapid and continuous technological change 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry may result in the introduction of new products or services that compete with our products or render them obsolete 
our success depends in part on our ability to respond quickly to technological changes through the improvement of our current products and the development of new products 
accordingly  we believe that we will need to allocate a substantial amount of capital to research and development activities in the future 
we may not generate cash flow from operations or have access to outside financing in amounts that are sufficient to adequately fund the development of new products 
even if we are able to obtain the required funding to develop new products  we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop products that we will be able to sell successfully 
our inability to improve our existing products and develop new products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our research and development efforts are costly and the results are uncertain  which may reduce our profitability and could result in losses 
our continued growth depends on penetrating new markets  adapting existing satellite communications products to new applications  and introducing new communications products that achieve market acceptance and benefit from our established international distribution channels 
accordingly  we are actively applying our communications expertise to design and develop new hardware and software products and enhance existing products 
these efforts are costly 
we expended million  or of our net sales  in fiscal on research and development activities 
additionally  our research and development program may not produce successful results  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
continued growth through acquisition could prove unsuccessful and strain our personnel and systems and divert our resources 
we have pursued  and will continue to pursue  growth opportunities through internal development and acquisition of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
our operations have expanded significantly as a result of our acquisitions of comstream  armer  tiernan  and xicom 
we are unable to predict whether or when any other prospective acquisition will be completed 
however  in order to pursue successfully the opportunities presented by the ground segment and emerging satellite delivered communications and broadcast equipment markets  we will be required to continue to expand our operations 
this expansion could entail various risks  including the following difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses or products due to unforeseen circumstances  the necessity to attract  train  motivate  and manage a significantly larger number of employees  the use of a disproportionate amount of our management s attention or our resources  substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  potential disruption of our ongoing business  our inability  once integrated  to achieve comparable levels of revenues  profitability or productivity as our existing business or otherwise perform as expected  and our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  or expand into new markets 
the occurrence of any of the risks described above or any failure to manage further growth in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business could have a material adverse effect on our growth and our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited by the ownership change caused by the sale of all of the shares of our common stock held by our majority stockholders 
we have net operating loss carryforwards that expire between the years and as a result of the sale in by stetsys pte ltd 
and stetsys us  inc of all of the shares of our common stock held by each company  we experienced an ownership change as defined by section of the us internal revenue code of  as amended 
because of the ownership change  we will be limited in our ability to use the net operating losses from before the date of the ownership change to offset items of taxable income realized after that date 
the annual limitation may also result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
in addition  any future ownership change could further limit the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset tax liabilities and may be viewed negatively by a prospective buyer of the stock 
our competitive position relies heavily on our proprietary technology and intellectual property 

table of contents we rely on our proprietary technology and intellectual property to maintain our competitive position 
unauthorized parties could attempt to copy aspects of our technologies or to obtain information that we regard as proprietary 
we may not be able to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
our failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our competitive position 
we generally rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees and some of our suppliers to protect our proprietary technology 
we also control access to and distribution of confidential information concerning our proprietary technology 
we cannot guarantee that the other parties to these agreements will not disclose or misappropriate the confidential information concerning our proprietary technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on patents to protect certain of our proprietary technology 
patents  however  often provide only narrow protection that may not prevent competitors from developing products that function in a manner similar to those covered by our patents 
in addition  some foreign countries in which we sell our products do not provide the same level of protection to intellectual property as the laws of the united states provide 
we cannot assure you that any patents we currently own or control  or that we may acquire in the future  will prevent our competitors from independently developing products that are substantially similar or superior to ours 
we may find it necessary to take legal action in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights 
litigation can be very expensive and can distract our management s time and attention  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain a favorable outcome in any intellectual property litigation 
we depend upon certain suppliers and subcontractors  the loss of which could cause an interruption in the production of our products 
we rely on subcontractors to assemble and test some of our products 
additionally  our products use a number of specialized chips and customized components or subassemblies produced by a limited number of suppliers 
we maintain limited inventories of these products and do not have long term supply contracts with our vendors 
in the event our subcontractors or suppliers are unable or unwilling to fulfill our requirements  we could experience an interruption in product availability until we are able to secure alternative sources of supplies 
we are also subject to price increases by suppliers that could increase the cost of our products or require us to develop alternative suppliers  which could interrupt our business 
it may not be possible to obtain alternative sources at a reasonable cost 
supply interruptions could cause us to lose orders or customers  which would result in a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the transition and loss of the services of certain members of our senior management or the inability to attract or retain additional technical personnel could impair our ability to conduct and expand our business 
our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel also is critical to the operation and expansion of our business 
the market for skilled engineers and other technical personnel is extremely competitive  and recruitment and retention costs are high 
although we have been able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to operate our business  we may not be able to do so in the future  particularly as we continue to expand our business 
although mr 
robert fitting  our ceo  who is years of age  and mr 
steve eymann age  our cto  are both critical to our business  the recent hiring of carl myron wagner age  as coo  has added a key management resource to our staff 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that succession plans will be successful 
further  the failure to attract and retain personnel with the necessary skills when needed could materially and adversely affect our business and expansion plans

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company designs  manufactures  sells  integrates and installs products  systems and software used for the transmission and reception of data and video over satellite  microwave and cable communication networks 
our products are used in applications for telephone land line and mobile  data  video and audio broadcast communications  private and corporate data networks  internet applications  and digital television for cable and network broadcast 
the company  through its tiernan subsidiary  is a supplier of hdtv and sdtv encoding and transmission equipment 
the xicom subsidiary is a producer of high power amplifiers for communications applications 
the company is headquartered in phoenix  arizona  has sales and manufacturing facilities in phoenix  arizona and san diego  and santa clara  california and sales or service centers in manassas  virginia  boca raton  florida  singapore  china  indonesia  the netherlands  the united kingdom  norway  and russia 
we sell our products through our direct sales offices and local agents and distributors 
we serve customers in over countries  including customers in the television broadcast industry  international telecommunications companies  internet service providers  private communications networks  network and cable television and the us government 
during our sales set a record at million 
the increase in sales was due  in part  to the company s acquisition of xicom in the second quarter of xicom sales for the seven months after the acquisition were million while the pre acquisition satellite electronics and broadcast equipment business grew to million 
the consolidated business also set a new record for earnings from operations at million  a increase from we have recently introduced new products with the latest technologies that can help our customers reduce their operational costs while increasing their capacity to deliver services 
these products include new higher bandwidth satellite modems  new hdtv decoders and our over the horizon troposcatter modem 
as we begin  we continue to pursue customers around the world where we believe we are well positioned to offer cost effective technology solutions that are competitive with other products in the marketplace 
our approach remains to focus our efforts on well defined hardware markets where we can rapidly develop and market communications products 
we are committed to offering reliable products that compare well with those of our competition in order to achieve our goal of maintaining strong gross margins 
we continue to manage our operations with tight cost control while investing in new product research and development where we believe we can achieve returns either through new product sales or reduced cost of manufacture 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new technologies or other businesses that compliment our existing product lines and have a clear path to providing new returns 
our ability to maintain profitable growth is contingent on our products being successful in the marketplace and the continued growth of the markets that we serve 
however  we anticipate that our earnings for will be impacted by increased general and administrative expenses  including stock option expense and a higher tax rate  and could be impacted by margin pressures 
preliminary indications for suggest that these trends remain positive 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies based upon historical results  anticipated future events  and various other assumptions  factors  and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon the actual shipment of product and transfer of the risk of ownership from us  or our contract manufacturers  to our customers in accordance with sec staff bulletins no 

table of contents revenue recognition and no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
we do not sell through distributors and we do not use consignment resellers as a method of selling our products 
revenue from services principally consists of sales related to services for installation and integration of satellite earth stations and video and microwave hub stations and are recognized at the time the services are performed 
we consider products and services as separate units of accounting under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
stock compensation 
for  the company elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options and to adopt the disclosure only alternative treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under sfas  deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value of the stock on the date of the option grant 
the deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the option 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company has adopted sfas r effective january  valuation of receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as through the creation of reserves established for specific customers deemed marginal in their ability to pay based upon factors known at that time 
in general  if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of that customer s ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation and impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas we are required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows  overall performance  identity and allocation and valuation of the assets  including goodwill and other intangibles of our reporting units 
market prices are not readily available for certain businesses  unique physical assets  and most intangible assets to be evaluated in goodwill impairment tests 
therefore  we estimate fair values using estimating techniques and assumptions that are matters of judgment 
during  as a result of the xicom acquisition  we recorded goodwill of approximately million on our balance sheet 
we applied the provisions of sfas and determined that there was no impairment 
warranty liability 
we provide limited warranties on certain of our products and systems for periods generally not exceeding two years 
estimated warranty costs for potential product liability and warranty claims based on our claim experience are accrued as cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our vendors  our warranty liability is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s present estimates  additional warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation of inventories 
inventories  consisting of satellite modems and related products  are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
our inventories include high technology components and systems sold into rapidly changing and competitive markets  accordingly  our inventories are subject to technological obsolescence 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if market conditions were to improve  we do not reverse previously recorded downward adjustments 
we monitor the subsequent sale of impaired inventory and the amounts subsequently sold are immaterial to our gross margin 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing these tax related balances 

table of contents results of operations sales net sales generally consist of sales of products  net of returns and allowances 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our revenue for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change sales for the year  sales increased due to the acquisition of xicom and growth in our pre acquisition satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment 
the addition of xicom contributed approximately million in sales growth with the balance resulting from growth in the pre acquisition business 
the growth in our pre acquisition business was largely due to increased demand for our satellite electronics products used in direct television broadcast in the us and in landline and mobile telephony backhaul in countries with rapidly growing telecommunications demand such as pakistan  india and china 
the company believes that these trends will continue for  however  does not appear likely that sales will continue to grow as rapidly as the company experienced in see bookings and backlog below 
vs 
years ended december  in thousands change sales for the year  sales decreased from the prior year this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales from our systems integrations and installation service which accounted for a decrease of million in sales from to the decision was made due to the very competitive nature of this portion of the market and the relatively low benefit we believe we received for being in the business 
this resulted in lower sales  but higher margins  as we concentrated on delivery of our core products and development of new higher margin products 
cost of sales cost of sales generally consists of costs associated with components  outsourced manufacturing and in house labor associated with assembly  testing  packaging  shipping  and quality assurance  depreciation of equipment and indirect manufacturing costs 
in addition  any expense related to adjusting the value of excess or obsolete inventory to reflect current market values when lower than original cost is included in cost of sales 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
gross margin is gross profit stated as a percentage of net sales 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change cost of sales gross profit gross margin during  overall gross margins decreased due to acquisition of xicom technology 
xicom s product margins are lower than pre acquisition radyne products 
margins from our pre acquisition satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment also decreased slightly as a result of increased competitive pressure and larger orders with quantity pricing 
cost of sales was further increased and gross margin further reduced due to write down and write off expenses resulting from periodic review of inventory values in our satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment 
these expenses were approximate million in compared to approximately  in this increase in excess and obsolescence expense was primarily the result of discontinuance of older products that were replaced with newer and updated models 

table of contents we believe that the satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment gross margins will continue to come under competitive pressure although we also believe that it is possible to offset some of that erosion with improvement in xicom gross margins 
there can be no assurance that initiatives to maintain and improve margins in either segment will lead to improved company performance

the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated vs 
years ended december  in thousands change research development the r d increase was primarily attributable to expenses related to the inclusion of xicom million 
the balance of increased r d expense resulted from the company s development of its new over the horizon troposcatter modem and enhancements to other satellite electronic products

these new product expenses are consistent with our strategy to invest in the company s future through research efforts that will result in new sales and returns to the company well in excess of the current development expense 
however  there can be no assurance that research efforts will result in new products that will be accepted by the market we address or  if accepted  that the profits on sales of the new products will be sufficient to cover costs expended

interest expense interest expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and respectively as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in the current year was due to interest on a loan to secure the xicom acquisition

the increase in tax expense resulted from the increase in profits generated by the company and an increase in tax rate 
although there is no assurance that we will continue to increase profitability  management s current projections indicate that the inclusion of a full year of xicom profits and possible growth of the company s pre acquisition satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment will result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate 
as of december   the company has total deferred tax assets of million with a corresponding valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   the company reduced the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets by million based on management s belief that it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
of this net reduction in the valuation allowance  approximately million was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense  approximately  was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and approximately  was recorded as an increase in deferred tax assets 
in addition to the  increase in additional paid in capital for the release of the valuation allowance related to the tax benefits of stock option exercises in prior years  additional paid in capital was increased for the tax benefit of stock option exercises during the year ended december  in the amount of approximately million for a total increase of approximately million 
on december   the company has total deferred tax assets of million with a corresponding valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance applies to the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards which management believes are limited as to utilization under internal revenue service code section ultimate realization of any or all of the deferred tax assets is not assured due to significant uncertainties associated with estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods and is subject to change depending on the tax laws in effect in the years in which the carryforwards are used 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets accordingly

risk factors  management believes that fundamental operating factors of the business will result in profits before taxes at levels equal to or higher than those recorded in these factors include inclusion of a full year of xicom operations and continued growth of the pre acquisition satellite electronics and broadcast equipment segment 
however  management believes that earnings per diluted share  however  will not grow as fast as earnings before income taxes due to increases in the weighted average number of diluted shares resulting from increased stock prices and new equity compensation  and due to increases in the company s tax rate

years ended december  in thousands change net earnings earnings per diluted share net earnings were million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to earnings of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended net earnings were higher in part due to the million tax benefit we received in compared to a million tax expense in and the million increase in gross profit as discussed above

as discussed above  the growth in the pre acquisition segments bookings and backlog resulted from increased sales to direct broadcast providers in the us and to providers of new landline and mobile telephony infrastructure in emerging telecommunications market in asia 
early indications orders received subsequent to year end suggest that these trends may continue although there can be no assurance of continued growth in the company s bookings backlog

as a result of the above  working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  
table of contents we maintain virtually all of our cash balances in the united states in us dollars 
for the coming year  we expect to continue to generate cash from operations at a slower rate than due to higher cash tax payments as we begin to exhaust our tax loss carryforwards and other tax benefits

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the company adopted sfas r effective january   and determined that it will follow the modified prospective method as well as continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and shares issued to employees in the employee stock purchase plan 
the company elected to continue to use the black scholes model as it is widely used and understood 
the company has not determined the likely rate of future grants nor vesting terms of stock options or equity compensation alternatives such as restricted stock 
the company granted both options and stock to carl myron wagner as an inducement to accept employment during the first quarter of the options granted to mr 
wagner vest equally over three years starting in january and the stock was vested immediately 
the expense related to the option vesting and the stock grant along with any other similar grants during the first quarter will be included in the company s first quarter financial filings 
the company has elected to continue its employee stock purchase plan espp which will be subject to sfas r valuation and expensing requirements 
the plan allows employees to elect to deduct a portion of their salary for either the first or second six months or both during the company s fiscal year 
the portion deducted is then used to purchase shares of stock from the company for the lower of the close price of the stock on the first or the close price on the last day of the six month period less a discount 
the ability to look back at the price at the start of the plan period is considered an option under sfas r and must be expensed accordingly 
further the discount exceeds the historic cost of flotation for the company s stock and also must be expensed 
the company believes that the program encourages employees to share in the company s prospects and aligns their interests with those of other shareholders 
the plan is subject to certain limitations of the internal revenue code  as amended 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accelerated the vesting of employee stock options  which would have resulted in million in stock option compensation expense over the vesting term of the options 
in  the company 
table of contents recognized expense of  which was reflected in the various categories on the consolidated statement of operations cost of sales  selling general and administration  and research development  as a result  there were no unvested options at december   thus there is no financial impact upon adoption of sfas r on january  the company intends to grant stock options in which will be compensatory under the provisions of sfas r 
in march  fasb issued interpretation number  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
there was no effect of adoption of the statement on the accompanying consolidated financial statement of the company

sfas no 
provides guidance on the methods issuers should use to account for and report accounting changes and error corrections 
specifically  this statement requires that issuers retrospectively apply any voluntary change in accounting principles to prior period financial statements  if it is practicable to do so 
this principle replaces apb no 
 which required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change to the new accounting principle on prior periods in the net income reported by the issuer in the period in which it instituted the change 
sfas no
