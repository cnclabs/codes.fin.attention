item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition matrix service records profits on long term contracts on a percentage of completion basis on the cost to cost method 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period when estimable or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
contract incentives are evaluated throughout the life of the contract and are recognized on a percentage of completion basis when the likelihood of obtaining the incentive becomes probable 
indirect costs such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts based on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 

table of contents claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if all of these requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
as of may  and may   accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues  to the extent of costs incurred  for unapproved change orders of approximately million and million  respectively  and claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
the following table provides a rollforward of revenue recognized on claims and unapproved change orders 
amounts disclosed for unapproved change orders exclude amounts associated with contract disputes disclosed in note contract disputes 
claims for unapproved change orders other claims total in thousands balance at may  additions collections gain loss balance at may  additions collections loss balance at may  contract dispute receivables contract dispute receivables are comprised of accounts receivable and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings for which settlement is subject to legal proceedings such as mediation  arbitration  or litigation 
such proceedings have resulted in delays in obtaining resolution 
as a result  the balances are presented separately on the balance sheet at estimated net realizable value based upon the most current information available 
amounts ultimately received may differ from the current estimate 

table of contents loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of may  and may   insurance reserves totaling million and million  respectively  are reflected on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims plus claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet date 
we establish specific reserves for claims using a case by case evaluation of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
additionally  the actual results of claim settlements could differ from the amounts estimated 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are our reportable segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross margins  operating expenses  interest  capital expenditures  cash flow and market assumptions are inherent in these estimates 
as a result  use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and ultimately results in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of these scenarios in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
recently issued accounting standards share based payments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
the statement requires that compensation costs for all share based awards  including employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the statement  as issued by the fasb  was to be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that began after june  however  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a new rule that delayed the effective date to the beginning of the fiscal year that began after june  we adopted the statement on june  
table of contents the statement allowed either a modified prospective application or a modified retrospective application for adoption 
we used a modified prospective application for adoption and applied the statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after june  also  for unvested stock awards outstanding as of june   compensation costs for the portion of these awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered was recognized as the requisite service was rendered after june  compensation costs for these awards were based on fair value at the original grant date as estimated for the pro forma disclosures under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas since we will use a modified prospective application  we will not restate prior periods 
through may   we accounted for share based awards to employees by applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
at june   we had approximately million of compensation cost from outstanding unvested stock awards to be recognized as the requisite service is rendered 
this cost will be recognized primarily in fiscal and our compensation cost as reported in pro forma disclosures required by sfas  as amended by sfas  may not be representative of compensation costs to be incurred in fiscal and beyond as the number and types of awards may differ and estimates of fair value may differ due to changes in the market price of our common stock and to changing capital market and employee exercise behavior assumptions 
we currently present pro forma disclosure of net income loss and earnings loss per share as if compensation costs from all stock awards were recognized based on the fair value recognition provisions of sfas the statement requires use of valuation techniques  including option pricing models  to estimate the fair value of employee stock awards 
for pro forma disclosures  we use a black scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value of employee stock options  and we intend to continue using a black scholes option pricing model under sfas r 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements

table of contents results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  the construction services segment and the repair and maintenance services segment 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states with only a minimal amount occurring in canada 
the construction services segment provides turnkey construction  civil construction  structural steel erection  mechanical installation  process piping  electrical and instrumentation  fabrication  vessel and boiler erection  millwrighting  plant modifications  centerline turbine erection  and startup and commissioning 
in addition  we offer design  engineering  fabrication and construction of aboveground storage tanks 
the repair and maintenance services segment provides outage and turnaround services  plant maintenance  electrical and instrumentation maintenance  tank inspection  repair and maintenance  industrial cleaning  and american society of mechanical engineers asme code repairs 
significant fluctuations in revenues  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment 
our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors  including the changing product mix and project schedules  which are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal this improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from a million increase in construction services revenues combined with an increase of million in repairs and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this improvement of million  or  in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues combined with improved margins 
consolidated gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to fiscal including a significant amount of low margin work that has since been replaced with higher margin work from both the construction services and repair and maintenance segments 
in addition  the larger consolidated revenue base allowed for further absorption of fixed costs while restructuring efforts in late fiscal led to a smaller fixed cost structure  which management believes is now in line to support the volume of work that is occurring 
consolidated sg a expenses were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decline of million is primarily due to an additional million contract dispute reserve recorded in fiscal as a result of the company s effort to accelerate the collection of amounts owed in order to help alleviate the liquidity situation at that time 
the company continues to aggressively pursue collections on its contract dispute receivables  therefore  legal costs continued to be significant at million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the remaining savings is related to restructuring efforts in late fiscal that led to a smaller fixed cost structure in fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the increase in revenues combined with the inclusion of the contract dispute reserve in fiscal impairment and abandonment charges of million in fiscal included a million impairment of goodwill in our construction services segment 
the company s policy is to perform a goodwill impairment review when impairment indicators exist and no less than once per year 
an additional review was performed in the third quarter of fiscal due to impairment indicators related to liquidity issues and operating results 
the remaining million related to a fixed asset impairment taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents restructuring charges in fiscal of million relate primarily to professional fees and costs incurred to shut down a fabrication facility that was not required for future operations 
the million charge in fiscal is due primarily to the restructuring program that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to liquidity issues and the company s unacceptable operating results 
the focus of this program was to reduce the cost structure and improve operating results and liquidity 
the details of this program are discussed further in note interest expense increased to million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is due to higher amortization of debt issuance costs of million and interest of million on the convertible notes issued in april  partially offset by lower cash interest costs of million due to reductions in our debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
other income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  both of which resulted from gains on the sale of assets identified during the restructuring effort 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from a loss before income tax expense of million in fiscal this million improvement was due to higher gross profit and higher gains on the sales of assets in fiscal combined with the inclusion in fiscal of a million contract dispute reserve  impairments of million and restructuring charges of million  partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the unusually low effective tax rate for fiscal is attributable to the absence of a tax benefit for the impairment of goodwill combined with establishing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of approximately million 
in fiscal  approximately million of previously established valuation allowances were reversed 
net income for fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share  versus a net loss in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share

table of contents construction services construction services revenues during fiscal were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
this improvement occurred due to increased revenue from the downstream petroleum industry of million combined with revenues from other industries rising million 
partially offsetting these improvements was declining revenue from the power industry  which fell million 
this improvement in the downstream petroleum industry has been consistent throughout fiscal while the jump in other industries is primarily related to liquefied natural gas work 
the decline in the power industry is due to only partially replacing this type of work in fiscal that was completed in fiscal gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was driven by improved margins and increased revenues 
construction services gross margins improved from in fiscal to during fiscal this improvement occurred as lower margin power industry work completed in fiscal was replaced by higher margin downstream petroleum industry work 
in addition  restructuring efforts in late fiscal led to reducing our fixed cost structure to be more in line with the volume of revenues occurring 
operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal from an operating loss and loss before income tax expense of million and million in fiscal  respectively 
this significant improvement is related to improved margins in fiscal and the inclusion in fiscal of a million contract dispute reserve and a million goodwill impairment 
partially offsetting these improvements was higher interest expense incurred during fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues from repair and maintenance services increased million  or  from million during fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increased revenues from the downstream petroleum industry  which improved million 
partially offsetting this improvement were declines in the power industry of million and other industries of million 
gross margins of for fiscal were higher than gross margins of in fiscal due to the inclusion of higher margin turnaround projects 
gross profit also saw an improvement from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a combination of the increase in revenues and better margins on projects 
operating income for fiscal of million was higher than operating income of million produced in fiscal and income before income tax expense for fiscal of million was higher than the million loss before income tax expense in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the benefit of additional revenues combined with higher margin work partially offset by higher interest expense 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal the decrease in consolidated revenues resulted from a million decrease in construction services revenues partially offset by a million increase in repairs and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million during fiscal this decline of million  or  in gross profit resulted primarily from the decline in revenues 
consolidated gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the decline in construction services revenue  which led to a smaller consolidated revenue base available to absorb fixed costs 
also negatively impacting margins was the partial replacement of construction revenues coming in the form of lower margin repair and maintenance work 

table of contents consolidated sg a expenses were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase of million was primarily attributable to an additional million contract dispute reserve recorded in the third quarter of fiscal for the previously disclosed contract disputes as a result of the company s effort to accelerate the collection of amounts owed in order to help alleviate the company s liquidity situation 
the table below provides an analysis of sg a and other charges in fiscal partially offsetting these expenses were cost reduction strategies implemented in both the first and fourth quarters of fiscal and a reduction in employee incentives  which are based on attainment of financial goals 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year as a result of a decrease in revenues combined with the contract dispute reserve adjustment and the other additional sg a charges noted in the table below 
impairment and abandonment charges of million in fiscal related primarily to a million impairment of goodwill in our construction services segment 
the company s policy is to perform a goodwill impairment review when impairment indicators exist and no less than once per year 
an additional review was performed in the third quarter of fiscal due to impairment indicators related to liquidity issues and operating results 
the remaining million related to a fixed asset impairment taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring charges of million in fiscal primarily related to the restructuring program that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to liquidity issues and the company s results 
the focus of this program was to reduce the cost structure and improve operating results and liquidity 
a small portion of this charge relates to environmental expenses for discontinued operations 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal due to higher interest rates and the increased level of debt that resulted from collection issues and contract disputes  which carried over from fiscal income before income tax expense decreased from million in fiscal to a loss before income tax of million during fiscal this million decrease was due to a combination of lower gross margins resulting from the decline in consolidated revenues  an adjustment to the contract dispute reserve  impairment of goodwill and higher interest expense

non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use  and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 

table of contents ebitda for the year ended may  was million compared to a million loss and million for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss follows fiscal year ended may  in thousands net income loss interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda provision for income taxes for the year ended may  includes million of taxes related to net earnings of joint venture 
the million increase in ebitda for the year ended may   as compared to the prior year  was in part due to improved operations that occurred as a result of the company s restructuring and turnaround efforts  which resulted in higher revenues and margins in fiscal in addition  impairment charges of million  a million contract dispute reserve and restructuring charges of million were recorded in fiscal outlook the company expects that revenues for the fiscal year ending may   will be between million and million 
gross margins for repair maintenance services should average between and and gross margins for construction services should average between and 
with revenues relatively equal between segments  we anticipate consolidated gross margins to average approximately to 
sg a is expected to average approximately million per quarter 
we expect a significant reduction in legal costs for fiscal versus those incurred in fiscal  however  those reductions should be replaced with significantly higher personnel costs as we prepare for future growth 
we have reinstated our professional development program for project managers and have added several new craft recruiters in various regions throughout the us our commitment to hiring  developing and retaining a skilled workforce is our top initiative for the upcoming year 
interest expense should be approximately million for the year which will consist primarily of the convertible debt interest expense that was prepaid for two years on april  the effective tax rate should be between and and matrix service should average approximately million fully diluted shares outstanding throughout the year 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in fiscal year to approximately million to replace certain existing assets and support our continued growth 
the future for matrix service is extremely strong given the current market dynamics in the downstream petroleum industry 
at may   our bank debt continued to be zero and our cash on hand exceeded million 
with robust growth and expansion opportunities in the canadian oil sands and lng markets  as well as continued repair and maintenance and capital projects in the gulf coast region  matrix service is poised to reach record net income levels 
we have engaged a search firm to replace our retiring president and ceo michael j 
hall 
we feel confident that whoever replaces mike will join the company with an excellent management team in place who will provide the nucleus for taking the company to a new and higher level of profitable growth 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity historically  matrix service has financed its operations with cash from operations and from advances under its revolving credit facility 
matrix service s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at may  and approximately million at may  during fiscal  operations provided million of cash and investing activities provided million of cash  while financing activities used million of cash 
contract dispute receivables decreased from million at may  to million at may  this decrease is due to the settlement and subsequent collection of million on one of our contract dispute receivables  partially offset by the addition of a contract dispute during fiscal for which resolution is only expected through legal proceedings 
prepaid expenses decreased from million at may  to million at may  the decline is primarily due to the amortization of bank fees on our senior credit facility and convertible notes of million  partially offset by fees paid upon the refinancing of our senior credit facility and higher prepaid insurance 
accounts payable were million as of may   as compared to million as of may  this increase of million  or  resulted from a large portion of revenues in the last month of the fourth fiscal quarter being driven by material intensive projects 
partially offsetting this increase to current payables was a reduction in past due payables as a result of improved liquidity that resulted from improvements in operations  the placement of common stock and our restructuring initiatives  including asset sales 
other accrued expenses were million as of may   which represents a decrease of million from the million balance as of may  this decrease was due to a reduction of million in the restructuring accrual as payments have been made  a decline of million that occurred from the payment of a deferred fee due to our lenders upon refinancing our senior credit facility and a decline of million in payroll related liabilities

on february   the company prepaid the term loan  but retains the right to increase the revolving credit facility up to the million aggregate commitment 
on may   availability under the revolving credit facility was million  which represents the existing million revolving commitment less outstanding letters of credit of million 
the terms and conditions of the credit agreement include customary affirmative and negative covenants that are structured to adjust upon repayment of the term loan

table of contents the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital  issuance of letters of credit or other lawful corporate purposes 
availability under the revolving facility is governed by a borrowing base equal to of outstanding accounts receivable less certain exclusions as defined in the credit agreement and is further reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the fed funds effective rate plus 
the additional margin ranges from to on alternate base rate borrowings and from to on libor based borrowings 
the senior leverage ratio for the quarter ended may   places the company in the lowest interest rate tier  resulting in libor and alternative base rate margins of and  respectively 
the credit agreement contains certain provisions that limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and imposes restrictions on capital expenditures 
these provisions limit outstanding capital and operating lease obligations to million at any time with a maximum of million in operating lease payments in any fiscal year

table of contents convertible debt in connection with the private placement of million of convertible notes  on april   we entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors in the convertible notes 
the registration rights agreement requires us to use our best efforts to keep our registration statement  covering the resale of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes  continuously effective until the earlier of a the date on which all of our common stock covered by such registration statement has been sold or may be sold without volume restrictions pursuant to rule k under the securities act of  as amended  or b the fifth anniversary of the closing date
