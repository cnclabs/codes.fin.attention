item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
overview our goal is to be recognized as one of the world s premier business process and it service providers by our clients  employees  and shareholders 
we believe that we can achieve this goal by helping clients transform their it and business operations through the consistent delivery of high value consulting  development  and outsourcing services 
specifically  we believe that applications services and business process services are large and synergistic growth markets  and that a significant business trend is corporations leveraging application outsourcing  bps  and global delivery to achieve meaningful cost reductions and business improvement 
we believe that our depth of capability in each of these areas  along with our vertical expertise  strong client relationships  and process management capabilities  position us well to capitalize on this market opportunity 
in support of this evolution in market demand  we are migrating keane s organizational structure from a geographic network of local branches to an integrated global matrix  which we have termed  one keane 
in the future  we plan to align client relationships and business development activities by geographic region  but business solutions will be designed and delivered by integrated global business lines and vertical practices 
we believe that this new organization better positions keane to deliver high value  transformational solutions that bundle vertical expertise  business process and applications services  intellectual property through a technology platform or a proprietary reference architecture  and cost effective global delivery 
moreover  we expect it will increase keane s flexibility and scalability  eliminate redundancy and excess costs  and improve the career growth opportunities that we offer our employees 
components of revenues we seek to help clients improve their business and it effectiveness 
we classify our service offerings into the following three categories outsourcing  development integration  and other it services 
outsourcing our outsourcing services include application and business process outsourcing 
our application outsourcing services help clients manage existing business systems more efficiently and more reliably  improving the performance of these applications while frequently reducing costs 
under our application outsourcing service offering  we assume responsibility for managing a client s business applications with the goal of instituting operational efficiencies that enhance flexibility  free up client personnel resources  and achieve higher user satisfaction 
we enter into large  long term contracts for the provision of application outsourcing services  which generally do not require any capital outlay by us 
these contracts usually span three to five years with the ability to renew 
we typically receive a fixed monthly fee in return for meeting or exceeding a contractually agreed upon service level 
however  because our clients typically have the ability to reduce services under their contracts  our monthly fees may be reduced from the stated contract amounts 
outsourcing services also includes ongoing maintenance related to the product sales for our healthcare solutions division 
through our global delivery model we can offer clients the flexibility and economic advantage of allocating work among a variety of delivery options 
these include onsite at a client s facility  nearshore in halifax  nova scotia  and toronto  ontario  and offshore at one of our four development centers in india 
this integrated  flexible mix of cost effective onsite  nearshore  and offshore delivery is now a component of most of our new application outsourcing engagements 
the distribution of work across multiple locations is typically based on a client s cost  technology  and risk management requirements 
our bps are provided by our majority owned subsidiary  keane worldzen  which we acquired on october  keane worldzen specializes in providing bps services to clients with complex processes in the financial services  insurance  and healthcare industries  and to clients with back office processes in several industries 
keane worldzen s bpo services are designed to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of our clients business transactions  enabling companies to focus on their more profitable activities and avoid the distraction of non core back office processes 
keane worldzen provides these low cost  high value outsourcing services from operations in both the us and india 
development integration as application software becomes more complex  it requires sophisticated integration between front end and back end systems to enhance access to critical corporate data  enable process improvements  and improve client service 
many of our development integration projects focus on solutions for the integration of enterprise applications  supply chain  and client service problems 
we also provide development integration services to the public sector  which includes agencies within the us federal government  various states  and other local government entities 
additionally  our healthcare solutions division provides software solutions and integration support to both acute and long term care providers 
other it services other it services are primarily comprised of it consulting  project management  and supplemental staff engagements that are principally billed on a time and materials basis 
global economic and political conditions may cause companies to be cautious about increasing their use of consulting and it services  but we continue to see a demand for our services 
we continue to experience pricing pressure from competitors as well as from clients facing pressure to control costs 
in addition  the growing use of offshore resources to provide lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry continues to be a source of pressure on revenues 
we also experience wage inflation  primarily in india  as the demand for those resources increases 
in order for us to remain successful in the near term  we must continue to maintain and grow our client base  provide high quality service and satisfaction to our existing clients  and take advantage of cross selling opportunities 
in the current economic environment  we must provide our clients with service offerings that are appropriately priced  satisfy their needs  and provide them with measurable business benefits 
while we have recently experienced a more steady demand for our services  we believe that it is too early to determine if developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins for and over the longer term 
there is a great deal of competition in the provision of outsourcing services 
we believe our evolving go to market strategy  where we seek to provide high value  repeatable business solutions to our clients  differentiates us from our competitors 
we offer solutions that combine various keane services and capabilities in response to a specific industry or client need 
these vertically focused solution sets may include application services  business process outsourcing  an underlying technology platform or intellectual property  and global delivery 
the solution sets that we offer to our clients may be comprised of five major elements 
first  they are vertically driven in that they are value propositions designed to address specific needs  challenges  or opportunities within an industry 
second  they may include application services  either in the form of applications development integration  or application outsourcing 
third  these solutions may also involve a business process component  including process reengineering and business process outsourcing 
fourth  we seek to leverage a technology platform  either provided by a third party or proprietary to keane  as well as keane intellectual capital  as a foundation for our solutions 
and finally  these solution sets frequently incorporate our global delivery capabilities 
we believe that our deep industry knowledge differentiates us from our competitors  allowing us to go beyond simply delivering cost and performance improvements to our clients  and allowing us to deliver transformational business benefits and  ultimately  help grow our business and integrate our comprehensive capabilities 
components of operating expenses the primary categories of our operating expenses include salaries  wages  and other direct costs  selling  general  and administrative expenses  and amortization of intangible assets 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs are primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  sub contractor  and other personnel costs  and other non payroll costs 
selling expenses are driven primarily by business development activities and client targeting  image development and branding activities 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems  and office space  which we seek to manage at levels consistent with changes in the activity levels in our business 
we continue to anticipate changes in demand for our services and to identify cost management initiatives to balance our mix of resources to meet current and projected future demand in our markets 
we will also continue to use our global sourcing as part of our cost effective delivery model 
we evaluate our improvement in profitability by comparing gross margins  and selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues 
other key metrics that we use to manage and evaluate the performance of our business include new contract bookings  the number of billable personnel  and utilization rates 
we calculate utilization rates by dividing the total billable hours per consultant by the total hours available  including sick  holiday  and vacation  from the consultant 
new contract bookings new contract bookings for the year ended december  were approximately billion  an increase of million  or  over new contract bookings of billion for the year ended december  new contract bookings for the year ended december  include the million victoria tta contract with the state government of victoria  australia  million of the victoria tta contract is included in outsourcing bookings and million of the victoria tta contract is included in development integration bookings 
for the year ended december   outsourcing bookings increased to million  development integration bookings increased to million  and other it bookings decreased to million compared to the same period in we provide information regarding our bookings because we believe it represents useful information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time 
however  information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues 
cancellations and or reductions in existing contracted amounts are not reflected in new contract bookings 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  the collectibility of accounts receivable  acquisition accounting  the valuation of goodwill  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  income taxes  and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of professional services  software licenses  software maintenance  and equipment 
we derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of professional services  which are recognized on a time and materials basis and proportional performance and represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and equipment through our healthcare solutions division  which represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or client purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon completion of services rendered or transfer of product title to the client 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the client 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the client will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
for general consulting engagements  we recognize revenue on a time and materials basis as services are delivered 
for the majority of our outsourcing engagements  we provide a specific level of service each month for which we bill a standard monthly fee 
we recognize revenue for these engagements in monthly installments over the billable portion of the contract 
these installments may be adjusted to reflect changes in staffing requirements and service levels consistent with terms of the contract 
for fixed price engagements  we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis over the life of the contract 
we use estimated labor to complete to measure the proportional performance 
proportional performance recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of each engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
for our sales arrangements that contain multiple revenue elements  such as software licenses  professional services and software maintenance  we first determine whether the arrangement is within the scope of emerging issues task force eitf eitf no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position sop sop sop  software revenue recognition  sop or sop sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting only if certain criteria are met 
in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the client and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of all remaining undelivered elements in the arrangement 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each separate unit of accounting or using the residual method 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another separate unit of accounting 
if such criteria are not met  then all deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting whereby all revenue is recognized based on the accounting applicable to the last element to be delivered 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each undelivered element based on the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
revenue allocated to the software license is based on the residual method in accordance with sop and sop sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  under which revenue equal to the fair value of professional services and software support is allocated to those items and recognized as revenue as those items are delivered 
any residual or remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is then allocated to the delivered software license 
we generally recognize software maintenance fees on installed products on a pro rated basis over the term of the agreement 
revenue is recognized for each element when each of the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria has been met 
key factors in determining revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services are management assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the software 
we evaluate revenue recognition for these types of arrangements on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  payment of the license fees and are dependent upon the performance of the services  the arrangement includes milestones or client specific acceptance criteria or the services include significant modification or customization of the software  then both the software license and services are recognized under sop generally  these agreements contain milestone provisions that vary by contract but relate to code load  installation  commencement of training  and demonstration that the software performs the functions requested by the client 
the milestones approximate progress to complete based upon input measures 
we utilize client acceptance of contract milestones in order to track progress to completion 
under eitf  in order to account for the deliverables within a contract separately  all delivered items must have standalone value  the vendor must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the client has a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items must be probably and substantially within the vendor s control 
we have concluded that objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all of the elements within the victoria tta contract 
accordingly  each of the elements cannot be separated into multiple units of accounting and therefore  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
as a result  we are deferring all revenues and costs directly associated with the delivery of services during the two years of development work  referred to as the build phase  and we will recognize all revenues and direct costs for the contract over the period of the ten years of operation and maintenance  referred to as the operate phase  currently estimated to begin in mid in all consulting engagements  outsourcing engagements  and software application sales  the risk of issues associated with satisfactory service delivery exists 
although we believe these risks are adequately addressed by our adherence to proven project management methodologies  proprietary frameworks  and internal project audits  the potential exists for future revenue charges relating to service delivery issues 
historically  we have not experienced major service delivery issues 
contract costs costs to deliver services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of set up costs and the cost of certain construction and non construction services for which the related revenues must be deferred under eitf or other accounting literature 
by analogy to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  deferred contract set up costs may include costs incurred during the set up phase of a client arrangement relating to employee transition  and relocation of key personnel 
by analogy to fasb technical bulletin as amended ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  we defer and subsequently amortize certain direct and incremental costs directly associated with the delivery of products and services related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to clients 
for contracts in which multiple elements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  the direct and incremental costs directly associated with the delivery of products and services are deferred and recognized over the period revenues are recognized 
we amortize deferred contract costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the period in which it was determined we would recognize the associated revenue 
useful lives range from years up to a maximum of the period when the associated revenue is recognized 
we review deferred contract costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related client contract 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  we record a charge is to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
our allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of our services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue in the period the risk is identified 
we use considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue 
business combinations in connection with acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and legal and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
in particular  restructuring liabilities are subject to change as we complete our assessment of the acquired operations and finalize our integration plan 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets at their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 
 sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted effective january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
our reporting units consist of aggregated branches that have similar economic characteristics  share the benefit of goodwill  and for which results are regularly reviewed by business operations management 
our goodwill is allocated to these reporting units for impairment assessment 
in performing our review of the recoverability of goodwill  we consider several factors  including the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
if  as a result of examining any of these factors  we conclude that the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  we will record an impairment charge and reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
we estimate the fair value of the business operations using a discounted cash flow model based on the future annual operating plan of each reporting unit 
this model determines the present value of the estimated cash flows of the reporting unit 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of income 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
as of december   our goodwill totaled million 
valuation of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  client related assets such as order backlog  client contracts  and client relationships 
we account for other intangible assets at their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions  and estimates 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas in performing our review of the recoverability of other intangible assets  we consider several factors 
these factors include the expected cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its estimated economic life  whether there have been significant changes in legal factors or the overall business climate that could affect the underlying value of an asset or whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 
in determining whether an intangible asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset  and other related factors 
if  as a result of examining the factors  we conclude that the carrying value of the other intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value  we will record an impairment charge and reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
if the estimates or the related assumptions used to determine the value of the intangible assets change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of december   our intangible assets totaled million 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the tax benefits of certain subsidiary net operating losses and the minimum pension liability 
our policy is to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by the tax authorities 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  we establish the reserves based upon our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and interest expense applicable to both permanent and temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjusted  as events occur to warrant the adjustment to the reserve 
if we determine that we will require more or less of our reserves in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations  and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares of our common stock to employees with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we also grant restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for a nominal purchase price 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas and sfas  we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with apb  we recognize compensation expense based on the difference between the market value at grant date and the grant price and record the compensation expense ratably over the restriction period 
we do not recognize compensation expense on our stock option grants as the stock options are granted at the market price at the date of grant 
had expense been recognized using the fair value method described in sfas  using the black scholes option pricing model  we would have recorded additional compensation expense and reduced net income by approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the stock based compensation expense for includes the impact of the acceleration of certain keane stock options granted prior to august  with an exercise price of or greater 
as a result of the acceleration  we would have had to record approximately million in pretax non cash compensation expense or approximately million net of taxes in the fourth quarter of see recent accounting pronouncements for discussion on sfas no 
revised sfas r share based payment  which was issued in december and is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
restructuring we have recorded restructuring charges and reserves associated with restructuring plans approved by management in the last six years 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires us to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan exists 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and real estate lease obligations 
the reserve associated with lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the ability to obtain subleases  the creditworthiness of our sub lessees  market value of properties  and the ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors 
while we believe that our current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  future events could require adjustments to these estimates 
based on the assumptions included in our analysis as of december   to the extent that we are unable to maintain all of our current  contractual subleases  we could incur an additional restructuring charge up to approximately million 
in addition  if we are able to negotiate early terminations of our operating leases or to obtain a subleasee  we would record a reduction to the restructuring liability and a corresponding expense reduction 
in and  we recorded a reduction to restructuring expense million and million  respectively  associated with early lease terminations and unanticipated subleases 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have a number of different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often  actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after we report our results 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary from these estimates 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
pension costs we have a foreign defined benefit plan that provides pension benefits to employees of our subsidiary located in the uk uk dbp 
the measurement of our pension obligation and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuary 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value and timing of projected future pension payments to plan participants taking into consideration retirement rates and mortality rates 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our uk dbp are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost projections  are evaluated and updated annually 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the projected benefit obligations and the fair values of the plan assets  pension expense  and the required minimum liability 
we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality  fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  and changes as long term interest rates change 
at december   we determined this rate to be during  we closed the uk dbp to future salary accruals effective april  accordingly  we accounted for the closing of the uk dbp as a curtailment under sfas no 
sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
as a result  in  we recorded a curtailment loss of approximately million to expense the unrecognized prior service cost  and we recorded an additional required minimum pension liability of approximately million as a non cash adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in  we recorded a net increase in the required minimum pension liability of approximately million through accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to lower investment yields on high quality corporate bonds 
as of december  and  the minimum pension liability was million and million  respectively  and is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
expected employer contributions for are approximately million 
however  recent legislation in the uk could have a significant impact on the funding levels required under the uk dbp in the future 
see note benefit plans in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we are reviewing various alternatives regarding the structure of the uk pension 
based upon information available to date  we believe the increase in future funding levels could range from approximately million to approximately million on an annual basis in and beyond 
consolidated results of operations compared to revenues dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease outsourcing    development integration    other it services    total    revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues compared to the year ended december  was partly due to revenues from netnumina solutions  inc netnumina  which we acquired on february   and higher revenues from new and existing clients  offset by decreases in revenues from pacificare and ibm  as discussed below  and the termination of a contract with a large client in the third quarter ended september  the increase was also due to the revenues associated with our acquisitions of nims associates  inc nims  which we acquired on february   and fast track holdings limited fast track  which we acquired on july  see note business acquisitions for a description of our acquired businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  both a large uk client and ibm notified us that they would be reducing their purchasing requirements 
the reduction of purchasing requirements from the uk client reduced our total annual revenues by approximately million in during the first quarter ended march   ibm also notified us that keane and other current vendor resources would be included in a proposal process for both current and future business 
in july  we decided to withdraw from our staff augmentation relationship with ibm 
in the third quarter ended september   we sold our ibm business to another provider 
these lower volumes from ibm and the sale of the business resulted in a revenue reduction for the year ended december  of approximately million compared to the year ended december  we have concluded that objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all of the elements within the victoria tta contract 
accordingly  each of the elements cannot be separated into multiple units of accounting and therefore  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
as a result  we are deferring all revenues and costs directly associated with the delivery of products and services during two years of development work  referred to as the build phase  and we will recognize all revenues and direct costs for the contract over the period of the ten years of operation and maintenance  referred to as the operate phase  currently estimated to begin in mid in  all revenues and direct and incremental costs associated with the delivery of products and services have therefore been deferred 
outsourcing 
outsourcing service revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in outsourcing service revenues compared to the year ended december  was partly due to revenues generated from new and existing clients from our application maintenance and bpo offerings  as well as revenues associated with netnumina 
the increase reflects approximately million of higher revenues generated by nims in compared to and approximately million of revenues associated with nims due to a full twelve months of results in these increases in outsourcing service revenues more than offsets lower revenues associated with pacificare  as discussed below  reductions from a large uk client and the termination of a contract with a large client in the third quarter ended september  pacificare  one of our largest clients  reduced the level of service from the stated baseline contract amounts in accordance with its right under the contract terms  thereby reducing the contract value 
we have provided services at or above the baseline levels set forth in the contract at agreed upon rates 
revenues from pacificare for the year ended december   were approximately million lower than revenues from pacificare for the year ended december  on december   unitedhealth group incorporated  an affiliate of united healthcare services  inc united healthcare  completed its acquisition of pacificare 
on january   we entered into a year master services agreement with united healthcare services  inc effective january  simultaneously  we and pacificare terminated our information technology services agreement  dated january   effective january  our original information technology services agreement with pacificare provided for an outsourcing arrangement with a ten year term and million in contract value 
the remaining contract value under that agreement as of january  would have been approximately million 
as a result of the ending of the original agreement with pacificare we will receive a million payment in two equal installments on july  and july  under the new master services agreement with united healthcare we will receive approximately million for a specified level of services provided from january  through june  development integration 
development integration service revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from our healthcare product and services and lower revenues from the large uk client 
other it services

during the second quarter ended june   pacificare requested that we further reduce service levels to levels below the minimums provided in our contract 
the requested change was not consistent with the terms of our contract with pacificare and would have resulted in a reduction in our monthly billings to pacificare 
accordingly  we did not agree to this change 
since then  through the year ended on december   we have continued providing services at or above the minimum levels set forth in the contract 
in accordance with the contract terms  we and pacificare jointly engaged an independent third party to conduct a study to compare our billing rates with benchmark rates 
the results assert that our rates are higher than the benchmark rates

sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this standard eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets to be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this standard is effective january  and we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec announced that it would provide for a phased in implementation process for sfas r 
specifically  the sec will require public companies that are not small business issuers as defined in sec regulation s b to adopt sfas r no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  therefore  we were required to adopt sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
effective january   we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method

keane  by our board of directors delegation of authority to him  approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain keane stock options granted prior to august  with an exercise price of or greater 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the impact of the option acceleration 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of fas r for the first quarter of our evaluation is based on awards granted as of december   but does not contemplate future awards which may be granted 
we do not believe the adoption of fas r will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the first quarter of in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas r 
this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no

it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

liquidity and capital resources consolidated financial condition dollars in thousands years ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   we have historically financed our operations with cash generated from operations 
in addition  we raised million in proceeds from the issuance of our debentures 
we use the net cash generated from these sources to fund capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  and stock repurchases 
if we were to experience a decrease in revenue as a result of a decrease in demand for our services or a decrease in our ability to collect receivables  we would be required to reduce discretionary spending related to sg a expenses and adjust our workforce in an effort to maintain profitability

cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by lower accounts receivable collection and the timing of certain cash payments 
days sales outstanding dso  an indicator of our accounts receivable collections  was days as of december  compared to days as of december  and days as of december  we calculate dso using the trailing three months total revenues divided by the number of days in the quarter to determine daily revenues 
the average accounts receivable balance for the three month period is then divided by daily revenues 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and our level of collection efforts 
many individual reasons are outside of our control 
as a result  our dso will normally fluctuate from period to period affecting our liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven in part by our receipt of a million payment in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the first quarter of  a million increase in tax payments during as compared to and higher working capital requirements due to the timing of payroll and subcontractor costs 
accounts receivable increased million to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the accounts receivable increase was largely driven by revenue growth in we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through the next months and beyond 
however  in order to protect against the current economic conditions persisting in and beyond  we have taken and will continue to take  as we deem necessary  steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenue 
we anticipate that current cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for the next months and beyond

total contractual cash obligations exclude the potential future cash payments required i in connection with potential earn out contingent consideration associated with cresta  nims  and fast track ii to settle the other put and call options associated with our keane worldzen acquisition see note business acquisitions in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion and iii to settle the accrued deferred compensation liability of approximately million and the uk accrued minimum pension liability of approximately million see note benefit plans in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recent legislation in the uk could have a significant impact on the future funding levels required under the uk dbp 
we are reviewing various alternatives regarding the structure of the uk pension 
based upon information available to date  we believe the increase in future funding levels could range from approximately million to approximately million on an annual basis in and beyond 
our material commitments are primarily related to our debentures  our credit facility  and our office rentals 
further discussion regarding our debentures can be found in note convertible subordinated debentures in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
further discussion regarding our credit facility can be found in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies 
contractual obligations related to operating leases reflect existing rental leases and the corporate facility as discussed in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  the fasb issued fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity  as defined  by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  an entity with a variable interest shall treat variable interests in that same entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
fin is effective prospectively for all variable interests obtained subsequent to december  for variable interests existing prior to december   consolidation will be required beginning july  in december  the fasb agreed to a broad based deferral of the effective date of fin for public companies until the end of periods ending after march   with the exception of interests in special purpose entities  which are required in financial statements of public companies for periods ending after december  we have evaluated the applicability of fin to our relationship with each of city square limited partnership city square and gateway llc and determined that these entities are not required to be consolidated within our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that gateway llc is not a variable interest entity as the equity investment is sufficient to absorb the expected losses and the holders of the equity investment do not lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest 
we have concluded that as we no longer occupy the space at ten city square and no longer derive any benefit from leasing the space  we would not be determined to be the related party most closely associated with city square 
as a result  we will continue to account for our leases with city square and gateway llc consistent with our historical practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that we do not have an interest in any variable interest entities that would require consolidation 
in february  our lease for ten city square expired and the building was sold to a third party 
we are a guarantor with respect to a line of credit for innovate ec  an entity in which we acquired a minor equity position as a result of a previous acquisition 
the total line of credit is for  we guarantee  of this obligation 
the line is subject to review by the lending institution 
we would be required to meet our guarantor obligation in the event the lending institution refuses to extend the credit facility and innovate ec is unable to satisfy its obligation 
in connection with certain contracts  we have been required to deliver security or performance bonds for the benefit of our clients 
these bonds give the beneficiary the right to obtain payment from the issuer of the bond if certain specified events occur or fail to occur 
in addition  we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify our clients or third parties with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights  improper disclosures of confidential information  personal injuries or property damages 
typically  there are no specific dollar limits associated with indemnifications 
in general  the term of the indemnifications will correspond to the contract term such that the harm or damage must occur during the contract period 
therefore  claims may be raised after completion of the contract associated with the indemnification provision  but the damage must have been caused during the contract term 
as a prime contractor under certain contracts  we are responsible for the performance of our subcontractors and would be required to arrange for performance in the event the subcontractors failed to perform 
however  we would retain our right to enforce the subcontracts and to seek damages for nonperformance from our subcontractors 
a limited number of our contracts include liquidated damages provisions  which would require us to make per diem payments for late deliveries 
further  our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties  including our subcontractors  for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
we have agreed to numerous indemnification provisions in connection with the victoria tta contract 
as the prime contractor for the victoria tta contract  kamco is the beneficiary of corresponding indemnifications obligations by its subcontractors 
subject to a number of exclusions  kamco s maximum liability is capped at million million aud 
under the victoria tta contract  liquidated damages  for which kamco may be liable  are assessed at   aud per day for each day the specified phase completion is behind schedule  but are limited to million million aud 
the first million million aud in liquidated damages is split evenly amongst kamco and certain subcontractors 
the next million million aud is apportioned based on responsibility for the delay 
in addition  we have a total of million million aud letters of credit issued against the new facility as surety bonds to ensure due and proper performance of our obligations under the victoria tta contract 
on september   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks in the amount of million  plus an additional amount of up to million subject to certain terms and conditions 
see note related parties  commitments and contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the new credit facility 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by us are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk  sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  and commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts 
however  on october   our board of directors approved our foreign exchange risk management policy  which will allow us to invest in hedging instruments for the purpose of hedging foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we invest primarily in us government obligations as well as tax exempt municipal bonds and corporate bonds 
as a result  our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk to our investments  which would affect the carrying value of those investments 
during  the united states federal reserve board began increasing benchmark interest rates and at the december meeting of the federal open market committee increased rates for the thirteenth time  a total of basis points 
a significant increase in interest rates would increase the rate of return on our cash and cash equivalents  but would have a negative impact on the carrying value of our marketable securities 
our interest income would change by approximately million for each of the years ended december  and december   for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million for a basis point increase in rates and increase million for a basis point decrease in rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  would have changed by approximately million for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
changes in market rates and the related impact on the fair value of our investments would not generally affect net income as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  when the investments are sold  the unrealized losses are recorded as realized losses and included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had a net unrealized loss of approximately million  which represents an increase of million compared to a net unrealized loss of approximately million as of december  at december  and december   we held available for sale securities with an aggregate fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  that had aggregate gross unrealized losses of approximately million and million  in those years 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the securities have been in an unrealized loss position and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
all such securities have been in a continuously declining unrealized loss position for less than months 
we believe that the impairments to these investments are not other than temporary at this time as these securities are all highly rated investments which have been subject to routine market changes that have not been significant to date 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the uk  canada  india  and australia and as such have exposure associated with movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our operating income by approximately million 
relative to the foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement would have resulted in an additional million reduction of operating income for the year ended december  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating income by approximately million 
relative to the foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement would have resulted in an additional million reduction of operating income for the year ended december  net revenues derived from our foreign operations totaled approximately   and of our total revenues for the year ended december    and  respectively
