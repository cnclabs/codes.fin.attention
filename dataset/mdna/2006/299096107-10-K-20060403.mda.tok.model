item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii of this annual report on form k for a list of some of the forward looking statements included in this form k 
see item a risk factors below for factors that may affect these forward looking statements 
item a 
risk factors our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our business model is changing and may not produce consistent earnings which could adversely affect our business our success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and products that require constant improvement in both price and performance 
in most of our markets we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing technology and products  then our revenues and growth rates could decline 
when new systems are ordered  prices are usually below our comparable  last generation systems 
success in this environment requires a business model that emphasizes smaller systems and associated hardware revenue  with greater dependence on software  databases  and support services 
we have made significant progress in adapting to this new business model and introducing products emphasizing the new factors for success 
however  there is no assurance that this model will succeed and ensure profitability in the future 
in addition  if we successfully sell our simulation business to rockwell collins and successfully acquire spitz  inc  then our business model will significantly change during our business will be based on digital theaters and laser projectors 
a significant portion of our future success will depend on completing and selling our laser projector  an unproven product  and future products based on this technology 
there is no guarantee that the laser projector or any future products based on this same technology will be successful in the market or that we can develop them 
if we are unable to develop our laser projector  our business may be adversely affected 
competitors or third parties may infringe e s intellectual property throughout its history e s has been awarded numerous patents 
while competitors or third parties have not materially infringed our patents  we are entering the production stage of a new product  the eslp 
we have a number of patents either issued or pending on this technology  but it represents a new field for us and may attract competitors with a risk of infringement and costly legal processes to defend our intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business 
migration to pc s in the commercial simulation market may negatively impact our revenues currently  off the shelf pc technology is not used in visual systems for level d certification in the commercial simulation market 
however  advances in technology could make it possible to attain level d certification with such systems 
if this occurs  e s would expect to deliver a range of products at different prices  with the risk of lower average prices and lower total revenue for the mix of commercial systems 
prime contractors may continue bringing work in house  decreasing demand for e s products large prime contractors in the defense and aerospace industry have encountered the same competitive pressures described earlier for simulation and training revenue 
to protect their own revenue and margins  most have responded by putting pressure on smaller suppliers  as well as bringing work in house to protect established engineering organizations wherever possible 
this trend has  in effect  created new competitors for our traditional business 
these in house engineering groups attempt to do only the most profitable work  such as software and databases  and leave less profitable hardware development to others 
often the costs of these efforts are not visible to the end customer because they are part of a much larger contract 
if these trends continue and the end customers accept the results  they could reduce demand for our software and databases  which would adversely affect our financial performance 
delays in new product introductions could negatively affect financial performance during  we intend to introduce several important new products  including the simfusion and the eslp 
delays in introducing and delivering these products could reduce planned sales and profit contribution 
changes in government priorities may further impact the military simulation market during the last several years significant changes have taken place in budget priorities for both us and international government spending  especially military spending 
some of these changes have resulted in delays or reductions of visual system purchases 
while we have downsized our company in accordance with these changes  we have no assurance that such delays will not continue to occur or accelerate and cause further declines in our revenue from this market 
we depend on several significant customers and our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer if their purchases decline we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on four of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
our sales could decline substantially as a result of terrorist attacks and other activities that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of our commercial airline customers to purchase our simulation products during  approximately of our total sales were derived from sales of our visual systems to commercial airline companies and other third parties in the commercial airline industry 
the demand for our various commercial simulation products and services is heavily dependent upon new orders from these commercial airline customers 
in the event terrorist attacks or other activities make air travel difficult or reduce the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our commercial simulation products  our revenue may decline substantially 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors and a majority of disinterested shareholders 
following the sale of our simulation business to rockwell collins  your ability to sell your stock may be substantially limited our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol escc 
following the completion of the proposed sale of our simulation business  we expect to continue to trade as a public company on the nasdaq national market 
however  it is not possible to predict the trading price of our common stock following the closing of the sale to rockwell collins 
if we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  we expect our common stock will be traded on the nasdaq capital market if we meet the listing standards of that market or we will attempt to be traded on the otc bulletin board or pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc the otc bulletin board and pink sheets are generally considered less efficient markets than the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq capital market 
we may not complete the transaction to sell the assets of our simulation business to rockwell collins which could adversely affect our level of expenses and operating results even though we have entered into the rockwell purchase agreement concerning the sale of our simulation business  this transaction may not be completed 
in order for the sale to be completed certain pre closing requirements must be met 
if these pre closing requirements are not met or if not waived as a requirement to closing  then this transaction will not occur  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may not receive the million in escrow related to the sale of assets to rockwell collins and the laser projector agreement as part of the rockwell purchase agreement and laser agreement  a total million is being held in an escrow account to secure any post closing reduction in the purchase price based on the net asset value of the simulation business at closing  our indemnification obligations under the rockwell purchase agreement and our delivery obligations under the rockwell laser agreement 
in the event that rockwell collins becomes entitled to any such purchase price reduction under the rockwell purchase agreement  penalty under the rockwell laser agreement or indemnification under the rockwell purchase agreement  we may forfeit some or all of the million deposited in escrow  which will reduce the amount of cash we have available in the future 
accordingly  there is no guarantee that we will receive these funds 
accordingly  there is no guarantee that we will receive these funds 
if we do not deliver a motion based eslp to rockwell collins by a specified time  rockwell collins has the right to withdraw up to million from the escrow account under the terms of the rockwell purchase agreement and the related escrow agreement 
our business will be harmed if the proposed sale of our simulation business to rockwell collins disrupts our business operations and prevents us from realizing its intended benefits prior to the closing of the sale of our simulation business to rockwell collins  our business operations may be disrupted due to a number of factors  any of which could harm our business or ability to complete the proposed sale 
these factors include loss of key employees  sales representatives  vendors  or customers  expenses incurred in connection with the proposed sale  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business 
we may not be able to integrate the spitz acquisition into our operations successfully if we successfully acquire spitz from transnational inc we may experience difficulties integrating their business with ours 
this could result in additional costs and loss of productivity that could materially affect our operations and financial results 
we may face risks related to an sec investigation and securities litigation in connection with the restatement of our financial statements we are not aware that the sec has begun any formal or informal investigation in connection with accounting errors requiring restatement of and financial statements and and quarterly financial statements  or that any laws have been violated 
however  if the sec makes a determination that the company has violated federal securities laws  the company may face sanctions  including  but not limited to  monetary penalties and injunctive relief  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  the company or its officers and directors could be named defendants in civil proceedings arising from the restatement 
we are unable to estimate what our liability in either event might be 
if we are unable to retain certain key personnel and hire new highly skilled personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
we are substantially dependent on the continued services of certain key personnel 
these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to the company and its operations 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
our business is also dependent on our ability to retain  hire and motivate talented  highly skilled personnel 
if we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel  we may be unable to meet our business plan and as a result  our stock price may decline 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our principal executive  engineering  manufacturing and operations facilities are located in the university of utah research park in salt lake city  utah  where we own three buildings totaling approximately  square feet 
the buildings are located on land leased from the university of utah with an initial term of years or longer 
we hold leases on several sales  operations  service and production facilities located throughout the united states  europe  and asia 
none of these are material to our manufacturing  engineering or operating facilities 
we believe that these properties are suitable for our immediate needs and we do not currently plan to expand our facilities or relocate to other facilities 
following the completion of the rockwell collins transaction we will no longer own one of the three buildings located in the university of utah research park in salt lake city  utah  and several leases on facilities in the united states and europe will be assumed by rockwell collins 
item legal proceedings in december  we settled a lawsuit previously filed by us against an insurance company with respect to an insurance claim made by us for losses incurred due to the cancellation of a significant contract by a customer 
under the terms of the settlement  we received a payment of  and agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and to provide a release of claims against the insurance company 
in the normal course of business  we may have various legal claims and other contingent matters 
we know of no legal claims or other contingent matters outstanding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal year part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol escc 
on march   there were holders of record of our common stock 
because brokers and other institutions hold many of our shares on behalf of shareholders  we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock and have used retained earnings for the operation and expansion of our business 
currently we have an accumulated deficit 
for the foreseeable future  we intend to follow our policy of retaining any future earnings to finance the development and growth of our business 
following the completion of the transaction contemplated by the rockwell purchase agreement  depending on our cash requirements and market conditions at the time  we plan to consider using a portion of the proceeds from the transaction with rockwell collins for a possible share buy back or special dividend 
however  our board of directors has not determined to take any such activity at this time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when we might do so
