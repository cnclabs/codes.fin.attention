back to contents funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be an appropriate supplemental disclosure of operating performance for an equity reit due to its widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
it is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the operating performance  such as gains losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization 
however  our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reit s and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reit s 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs  including distributions 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
consistent with the nareit definition  we define ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the reconciliations of net income to ffo for the years ended december     and are as follows reconciliation of net income to funds from operations for the years ended december  net income depreciation of real estate and amortization of leasing costs wholly owned and consolidated partnerships unconsolidated partnerships income attributable to minority interest in operating partnership gain loss on sale of properties cumulative effect of change in accounting principle funds from operations notes represents income attributable to common operating partnership units and does not include distributions paid to series a and b preferred op unitholders 
liquidity and capital resources uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity are expected to be for distributions to our shareholders and op unit holders  debt service and loan repayments  and property investment which include the funding of our joint venture commitments  acquisition  redevelopment  expansion and re tenanting activities 
distributions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must currently distribute at least of our taxable income to our shareholders

we are the manager and general partner of fund i with a interest 
in addition to a pro rata return on our invested equity  we are entitled to a profit participation based upon certain investment return thresholds 
cash flow is to be distributed pro rata to the partners including us until they have received a cumulative return on  and a return of all capital contributions 
thereafter  remaining cash flow is to be distributed to the partners including us and to us 
we also earn a fee for asset management services equal to of the allocated equity in the remaining fund i assets  as well as market rate fees for property management  leasing and construction services 

back to contents as of december   fund i has purchased a total of properties totaling million square feet as further discussed in property acquisitions in item of this form k 
acadia strategic opportunity fund ii  llc fund ii on june   we closed our second acquisition fund  fund ii  which includes all of the investors from fund i as well as two additional institutional investors 
with million of committed discretionary capital  fund ii expects to be able to acquire up to million of real estate assets on a leveraged basis 
we are the managing member with a interest in the joint venture

this store occupies  square feet of formerly vacant space 
costs incurred to date for this project totaled million 
our redevelopment program focuses on selecting well located neighborhood and community shopping centers and creating significant value through re tenanting and property redevelopment 
during  we did not undertake any significant redevelopment projects within our core portfolio 
additionally  for the year ending december   we currently estimate that capital outlays of approximately million to million will be required for tenant improvements  related renovations and other property improvements 
share repurchase repurchases of our common shares is an additional use of liquidity as discussed in item of this form k 
sources of liquidity we intend on using fund ii as the primary vehicle for our future acquisitions  including investments in the rcp venture and new york urban infill redevelopment initiative 
sources of capital for funding our joint venture commitments  other property acquisitions  redevelopment  expansion and re tenanting  as well as future repurchases of common shares are expected to be obtained primarily from issuance of public equity or debt instruments  cash on hand  additional debt financings and future sales of existing properties 
as of december   we had a total of approximately million of additional capacity under existing debt facilities  cash and cash equivalents on hand of million  and properties that are unencumbered and available as potential collateral for future borrowings 
we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all of our debt service payments  recurring capital expenditures and reit distribution requirements 
issuance of equity during november  we issued  common shares the offering 
the offering was made under shelf registration statements filed under the securities act of  as amended  and previously declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the million in proceeds from the offering  net of related costs  were used to retire above market  fixed rate indebtedness as well as to invest in real estate assets 
following this transaction  we have million of remaining capacity to issue equity under our primary shelf registration statement

interest rates on our outstanding mortgage indebtedness ranged from to with maturities that ranged from july to november taking into consideration million of notional principal under variable to fixed rate swap agreements currently in effect  million of the portfolio  or  was fixed at a weighted average interest rate and million  or was floating at a weighted average interest rate 
there is no debt maturing in and in  million is scheduled to mature at a weighted average interest rate of 
as we do not anticipate having sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness  we will need to refinance this indebtedness or select other alternatives based on market conditions at that time 
the following summarizes the financing and refinancing transactions since december  on february   we drew down million under an existing revolving facility  which bears interest at libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from this drawdown were utilized for the preferred equity investment with levitz sl  llc 
during april  we borrowed million under an existing secured revolving facility which was repaid in may on may   we closed on a million cross collateralized revolving facility which is collateralized by five of our properties 
the facility bears interest at libor plus basis points and matures june  at closing  the lender advanced million  of which million was used to refinance an existing facility with the same lender 
on june   an additional million was drawn on this line 
on october   million was repaid on this line resulting in million outstanding under this facility as of december  on august   we closed on a million loan  which bears interest at a fixed rate of 
this loan  which matures september  requires the payment of interest only until october  and thereafter interest and principal based on year amortization

back to contents off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in three joint ventures for the purpose of investing in operating properties as follows we own a interest in two partnerships which own the crossroads shopping center crossroads 
we account for the investment in crossroads using the equity method of accounting as we have a non controlling investment in crossroads  but exercise significant influence 
as such  our financial statements reflect our share of income from  but not the assets and liabilities of  crossroads 
our pro rata share of crossroads mortgage debt as of december  was million 
this fixed rate debt bears interest at and matures in december reference is made to the discussion of funds i and ii under uses of liquidity in this item for additional detail related to our investment in and commitments to funds i and ii 
as of december   we own a interest in fund i and in fund ii for which we also use the equity method of accounting 
our pro rata share of funds i and ii fixed rate mortgage debt as of december  was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
our pro rata share of funds i and ii variable rate mortgage debt as of december  was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
maturities on these loans range from march to january historical cash flow the following discussion of historical cash flow compares our cash flow for the year ended december  with our cash flow for the year ended december  
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase of million was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows years ended december  amounts in millions variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities the variance in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase of million in operating income before non cash expenses in  which was primarily due to an increase in asset management and service fee income from our fund investments  additional fee income from the acquisition of certain management contracts rights in january and february  promote income on the mervyn s investment in  and additional interest income resulting from our preferred equity investment in and a decrease in distributions received from unconsolidated partnerships 
these increases were offset by additional general and administrative costs due to increased compensation and other overhead expenses following the expansion of our infrastructure 
in addition  a net decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of million resulted primarily from an increase in receivables related to third party construction cost reimbursements offset by an increase in income taxes payable related to the company s share of the gain realized by mervyn s 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from a million preferred equity investment in  an million increase in expenditures for real estate acquisitions  development and tenant installation during and a decrease of million of distributions received from unconsolidated partnerships 
these decreases were offset by a million decrease in investments in and advances to unconsolidated partnerships in and million of proceeds received from the sale of a property in the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the following debt repayment in debt repayment in additional borrowings in proceeds from issuance of common shares in proceeds of exercise of stock options in miscellaneous total variance critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

back to contents valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  we review the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs on properties held for use  we reduce our carrying cost to fair value  and for properties held for sale  we reduce our carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the year ended december   an impairment loss of million was recognized related to a property that was sold in july of management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  or bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   we had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements reference is made to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage debt 
see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage debt 
currently  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we had total mortgage debt of million of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to five interest rate swap transactions to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of libor based variable rate debt 
we also have three forward starting interest rate swaps which commence during  and and mature from to that will hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of refinanced libor based variable rate debt with the matching maturities 

back to contents the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts amounts in millions consolidated mortgage debt year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate n a n a thereafter mortgage debt in unconsolidated partnerships at our pro rata share year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate n a thereafter of our total outstanding debt  million will become due in as we intend on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates which may be greater than the current interest rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
interest expense on our variable debt as of december  would not increase materially as we only have million of floating rate debt after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps hedging million of notional principal 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means
