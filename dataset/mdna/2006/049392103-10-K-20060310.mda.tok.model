we define gross margin as revenue less purchased product costs 
purchased product costs include the cost of natural gas and ngls that we purchase from third parties 
our management views gross margin as an important performance measure of core profitability for our operations and as a key component of our internal financial reporting 
we believe that investors benefit from having access 
table of contents to the same financial measures that our management uses 
the following table reconciles our net income to gross margin in thousands years ended december  in thousands net income plus minus interest income and other plant operating transportation and compression general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss gain on arbitration settlement  net interest expense minority interest in noark net income minority interest share of gross margin for noark gross margin ebitda represents net income before net interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding to ebitda other non cash items such as compensation expenses associated with unit issuances to members of the managing board and employees of our general partner 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to represent cash flow and do not represent the measure of cash available for distribution 
our method of computing ebitda may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies 
the ebitda calculation below is different from the ebitda calculation under our credit facility 
adjusted ebitda excludes net gain or loss on arbitration settlement as a non recurring item 
certain items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity s financial performance  such as their cost of capital and its tax structure  as well as historic costs of depreciable assets 
we have included information concerning ebitda and adjusted ebitda because they provide investors and management with additional information as to our ability to pay fixed charges and are presented solely as a supplemental financial measure 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to  or more meaningful than  net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as indicators of our operating performance or liquidity

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
general atlas pipeline partners  lp is a delaware limited partnership formed in may to acquire  own and operate natural gas gathering systems previously owned by atlas america  inc and its affiliates atlas america  a publicly traded company nasdaq atls 
we provide midstream energy services through the transmission  gathering and processing of natural gas in the appalachian and mid continent areas of the united states  specifically pennsylvania  ohio  new york  oklahoma  texas  arkansas and missouri 
we conduct our business through two operating segments our mid continent operations and our appalachian operations 
we own and operate through our mid continent operations a interest in a ferc regulated  mile interstate pipeline system  that extends from southeastern oklahoma through arkansas and into southeastern missouri and which has throughput capacity of approximately mmcf d  two natural gas processing plants with aggregate capacity of approximately mmcf d and one treating facility with a capacity of approximately mmcf d  all located in oklahoma  and  miles of active natural gas gathering systems located in oklahoma  arkansas  northern texas and the texas panhandle  which transport gas from wells and central delivery points in the mid continent region to our natural gas processing plants or transmission lines 
we own and operate through our appalachian operations  miles of intrastate natural gas gathering systems located in eastern ohio  western new york and western pennsylvania 
through an omnibus agreement and other agreements between us and atlas america  the parent of our general partner and a leading sponsor of natural gas drilling investment partnerships in the appalachian basin  we gather substantially all of the natural gas for our appalachian basin operations from wells operated by atlas america 
among other things  the omnibus agreement requires atlas america to connect to our gathering systems wells it operates that are located within  feet of our gathering systems 
we are also party to natural gas gathering agreements with atlas america under which we receive gathering fees generally equal to a percentage  typically  of the selling price of the natural gas we transport 
these agreements are continuing obligations and have no specified term except that they will terminate if our general partner is removed without cause 
significant acquisitions from the date of our initial public offering in january through december  we have completed five acquisitions at an aggregate cost of approximately million  including  most recently in october  we acquired from enogex  a wholly owned subsidiary of oge energy corp  all of the outstanding equity of atlas arkansas  which owns a interest in noark  for million  including million for working capital adjustments and other related transaction costs 
noark s principal assets include the ozark gas transmission system  a mile interstate natural gas pipeline  and ozark gas gathering  a mile natural gas gathering system 
the remaining interest in noark is owned by southwestern 

table of contents in april  we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of elk city for million  including related transaction costs 
elk city s principal assets include approximately miles of natural gas pipelines located in the anadarko basin in western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  a natural gas processing facility in elk city  oklahoma  with a total capacity of approximately mmcf d and a gas treatment facility in prentiss  oklahoma  with a total capacity of approximately mmcf d 
in july  we acquired spectrum for million  including transaction costs and the payment of taxes due as a result of the transaction 
spectrum s principal assets consist of  miles of active and miles of inactive natural gas gathering pipelines in the golden trend area of southern oklahoma and the barnett shale area of north texas and a natural gas processing facility in stephens county  oklahoma  with a total capacity of approximately mmcf d 
contractual revenue arrangements our principal revenue is generated from the transportation and sale of natural gas and ngls 
variables which affect our revenue are the volumes of natural gas we gather  transport and process which  in turn  depend upon the number of wells connected to our gathering systems  the amount of natural gas they produce  and the demand for natural gas and ngls  and the transportation and processing fees we receive which  in turn  depend upon the price of the natural gas and ngls we transport and process  which itself is a function of the relevant supply and demand in the mid continent  mid atlantic and northeastern areas of the united states 
in appalachia  substantially all of the natural gas we transport is for atlas america under percentage of proceeds  or pop  contracts  as described below  where we earn a fee equal to a percentage  generally  of the selling price of the gas subject  in most cases  to a minimum of or per mcf 
since our inception in january  our appalachian transportation fee has always exceeded this minimum 
the balance of the appalachian gas we transport is for third party operators generally under fixed fee contracts 
our revenue in the mid continent region is determined primarily by the fees earned from our transmission  gathering and processing operations 
we either purchase gas from producers and move it into receipt points on our pipeline systems  and then sell the natural gas  or produced ngls  if any  off of delivery points on our systems  or we transport natural gas across our systems  from receipt to delivery point  without taking title to the gas 
revenues associated with our ferc regulated transmission pipeline are comprised of firm transportation rates and  to the extent capacity is available following the reservation of firm system capacity  interruptible transportation rates and are recognized at the time the transportation service is provided 
revenue associated with the physical sale of natural gas is recognized upon physical delivery of the natural gas 
in connection with our gathering and processing operations  we enter into the following types of contractual relationships with our producers and shippers fee based contracts 
these contracts provide for a set fee for gathering and processing raw natural gas 
our revenue is a function of the volume of gas that we gather and process and is not directly dependent on the value of the natural gas 
pop contracts 
these contracts provide for us to retain a negotiated percentage of the sale proceeds from residue natural gas and ngls we gather and process  with the remainder being remitted to the producer 
in this situation  we and the producer are directly dependent on the value of the commodity and its value  we own a percentage of that commodity and are directly subject to its market value 

table of contents keep whole contracts 
these contracts require us  as the processor  to bear the economic risk the processing margin risk that the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the processed natural gas and ngls could be less than the amount that we paid for the unprocessed natural gas 
however  since the gas received by the elk city system  which is currently our only gathering system with keep whole contracts  is generally low in liquids content and meets downstream pipeline specifications without being processed  the gas can be bypassed around the elk city processing plant and delivered directly into downstream pipelines during periods of margin risk 
therefore  the processing margin risk associated with such type of contracts is minimized 
as a result of our pop and keep whole contracts  our results of operations and financial condition substantially depend upon the price of natural gas and ngls 
we believe that future natural gas prices will be influenced by supply deliverability  the severity of winter and summer weather and the level of united states economic growth 
based on historical trends  we generally expect ngl prices to follow changes in crude oil prices over the long term  which we believe will in large part be determined by the level of production from major crude oil exporting countries and the demand generated by growth in the world economy 
the number of active oil and gas rigs has increased in recent years  mainly due to recent significant increases in natural gas prices  which could result in sustained increases in drilling activity during the current and future periods 
however  energy market uncertainty could negatively impact north american drilling activity in the short term 
lower drilling levels over a sustained period would have a negative effect on natural gas volumes gathered and processed 
we closely monitor the risks associated with these commodity price changes and their potential impact on our operations and  where appropriate  use various commodity instruments such as natural gas  crude oil and ngl contracts to hedge a portion of such price risks 
we do not realize the full impact of commodity price changes because some of our sales volumes were previously hedged at prices different than actual market prices for the period

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
natural gas and liquids revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the prior year 
the increase was attributable to revenue contributions from the noark system acquired in october of million and the elk city system acquired in april of million  and an increase in velma natural gas and liquids revenue of million due to a full year s contribution after its acquisition in july and higher commodity prices 
gross natural gas gathered averaged mmcf d on the velma system for the year ended december   an increase of from the prior period from its date of acquisition through december  gross natural gas gathered on the elk city system averaged mmcf d from its date of acquisition through december  for the noark system  average throughput volume was mmcf d from october   its date of acquisition  to december  transportation and compression revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this million increase was primarily due to contributions from the transportation revenues associated with the noark system acquired in october of million and increases in the appalachia average transportation rate earned and volume of natural gas transported 
our appalachia average transportation rate was per mcf for the year ended december  as compared with per mcf for the prior year  an increase of per mcf 
appalachia s average throughput volume was mmcf d for the year ended december  as compared with mmcf d for the prior year  an increase of mmcf d 
the increase in the appalachia average daily throughput volume was principally due to new wells connected to our gathering system and the completion of a capacity expansion project in on certain sections of our pipeline system during the current period 
costs and expenses 
natural gas and liquids cost of goods sold of million and plant operating expenses of million for the year ended december  represented increases of million and million  respectively  from the prior year amounts due primarily to contributions from the acquisitions and an increase in commodity prices 
transportation and compression expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  due mainly to noark system operating costs from its date of acquisition and higher appalachia operating costs as a result of compressors added during in connection with our capacity expansion project and higher maintenance expense as a result of additional wells connected to our gathering system 
general and administrative expenses  including amounts reimbursed to affiliates  increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to a million increase in non cash compensation expense related to vesting of phantom and common unit awards  million of expenses associated with the acquisitions  and higher costs associated with managing our business  including management time related to acquisitions and capital raising opportunities 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year due principally to the increased asset base associated with the acquisitions 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the prior year 
this million increase was primarily due to interest associated with borrowings under our credit facility to finance our acquisitions and million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs 
this accelerated amortization was associated with the retirement of the term portion of our credit facility in april net gain on arbitration settlement of million for the year ended december  is the result of a december  settlement agreement with semco settling all issues and matters related to our terminated acquisition of alaska pipeline company from semco 
the gain reflects million received from semco  net of million of associated costs 

table of contents minority interest in noark of million for the year ended december  represents southwestern s ownership interest in the net income of noark from our date of acquisition through december  our financial results include the consolidated financial statements of noark from the date of its acquisition 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
natural gas and liquids revenue of million for the year ended december  was associated with the acquisition of our velma operations in july and reflects approximately five and one half months of operations in appalachia transportation and compression revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this million increase was primarily due to an increase in the average transportation rate earned and an increase in the volumes of natural gas transported 
the average transportation rate was per mcf for the year ended december  as compared with per mcf for the prior year  an increase of per mcf 
the average daily throughput volumes were mmcf d for the year ended december  as compared with mmcf d for the prior year  an increase of mmcf d 
the increase in the average daily throughput volume was principally due to new wells connected to the appalachia gathering system  partially offset by the natural decline in production volumes from existing wells connected to it 
costs and expenses 
natural gas and liquids cost of goods sold of million and plant operating expenses of million for the year ended december  were associated with the acquisition of our velma operations and reflect five and one half months of activity 
appalachian transportation and compression expenses decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compressor expenses due to the purchase of several compressors that were previously leased at the end of general and administrative expenses  including amounts reimbursed to affiliates  increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to million of general and administrative expenses associated with our velma operations  million of expenses related to compensation expense for phantom units issued under our long term incentive plan  a million increase in allocations of compensation and benefits from atlas america and its affiliates due to management time associated with acquisitions and public offerings  and million of costs associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley and the preparation and filing of two tax returns for the filing of two tax returns was a result of our general partner s ownership interest in us being reduced below as a result of our sale of common units in may  requiring a change in our tax year end from september to december this necessitated the filing of an additional short year tax return 
this expense is non recurring 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year due principally to the increased asset base associated with our acquisition of the velma operations and pipeline extensions and compressor upgrades in appalachia 
net gain on arbitration settlement of million for the year ended december  is the result of a december  settlement agreement with semco settling all issues and matters related to our terminated acquisition of alaska pipeline company from semco 
the gain reflects million received from semco  net of million of associated costs 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the prior year 
this million increase was primarily due to interest associated with borrowings under the credit facility to finance our acquisition of the velma operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our unitholders and general partner 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures through existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits through the retention of cash and additional borrowings  and debt principal payments through additional borrowings as they become due or by the issuance of additional common units 
at december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and million of outstanding letters of credit which are not reflected as borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet  with million of remaining committed capacity under the million credit facility  subject to covenant limitations see credit facility 
in addition to the availability under the credit facility  we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission  which allows us to issue equity or debt securities see shelf registration statement of which million remains available at december  at december   we had a working capital position of million compared with million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the working capital provided by the operations of the acquired assets 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and borrowing capacity to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  unitholder distributions  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cashflow 
we may supplement our cash generation with proceeds from financing activities  including borrowings under our credit facility and other borrowings and the issuance of additional common units 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the prior year 
the increase is derived principally from increases in net income attributable to partners of million  depreciation and amortization of million  non cash compensation expense of million  and amortization of deferred financing costs of million 
the increases in net income attributable to partners and depreciation and amortization were principally due to the contribution from the acquisitions of spectrum in july  elk city in april  and noark in october net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the prior year 
this increase was principally due to the acquisitions mentioned previously and a million increase in capital expenditures 
see further discussion of capital expenditures under capital requirements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the prior year 
this increase was principally due to the million of net proceeds from the issuance of million of year  senior unsecured notes in december  which were primarily utilized to repay indebtedness incurred under our credit facility to 
table of contents partially fund our acquisitions  and million of additional net proceeds received from sales of common units 
this increase was partially offset by a million increase in net repayments under our credit facility and an increase of million in cash distributions to partners due mainly to increases in our limited partner units outstanding and our cash distribution amount per limited partner unit 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the prior year

see further discussion of capital expenditures under capital requirements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the prior year 
this increase was principally due to million of additional net proceeds received from our sales of common units and a million increase in net borrowings under our credit facility  mainly to fund the acquisition of the velma operations 
this increase was partially offset by an increase of million in cash distributions to partners due mainly to increases in our limited partner units outstanding and our cash distribution amount per limited partner unit 
capital requirements our operations require continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety  operational  and environmental regulations 
our capital requirements consist primarily of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and expansion capital expenditures to acquire complementary assets and to expand the capacity of our existing operations 
the following table summarizes maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  excluding amounts paid for acquisitions  for the periods presented in thousands years ended december  maintenance capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures total expansion capital expenditures increased to million for the year ended december   due principally to expansions of the velma and elk city gathering systems and processing facilities to accommodate new wells drilled in our service areas 
expansion capital expenditures for our mid continent region also include approximately million of costs incurred related to the construction of the sweetwater 
table of contents gas plant  a new natural gas processing plant in oklahoma expected to be operational in the third quarter of see significant announced internal growth project 
in addition  expansion capital expenditures increased due to compressor upgrades and gathering system expansions in the appalachia region 
maintenance capital expenditures for the year ended december  remained relatively consistent compared with the prior year period 
as of december   we are committed to expend approximately million on pipeline extensions  compressor station upgrades and processing facility upgrades  including million related to the sweetwater gas plant 
expansion capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared with million for the prior year due principally to expansions of the velma gathering system and processing facilities to accommodate new wells drilled in our service areas and compressor upgrades and gathering system expansions in the appalachia region 
maintenance capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared with million for the prior year due principally to the purchase of appalachia pipeline compressors in to replace units which were formerly leased 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves  including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when our general partner determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner if quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed specified targets  as described in item  market for registrant s common equity and related unitholder matters 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate amount of cash being distributed 
the general partner s incentive distributions declared for year ended december  was million
