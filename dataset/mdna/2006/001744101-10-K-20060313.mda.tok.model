we completed secondary offerings of our common stock for  and  shares on april  and may   respectively 
all of the  shares were sold by affiliates of haas wheat partners  lp the hwp stockholders  a private equity investment firm whose affiliates had owned shares of the company since on november   we completed the acquisition of the mha group  inc  a texas corporation  and subsidiaries mha 
mha  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  provides temporary physician  nurse and allied healthcare staffing services and physician and allied healthcare permanent placement services 
the purchase price is comprised of million of initial consideration plus acquisition costs of million and an earn out payment of million based on mha s financial performance for the twelve months ended december   which was paid by march  the initial million of consideration and the earn out payment were paid approximately in cash and in unregistered shares of the company s common stock  par value per share 
at the closing of the acquisition of mha  we issued million shares of common stock and issued an additional million shares on march  for payment of the earn out amounts 
in connection with the acquisition  we amended our existing credit facility 
our amended and restated credit facility the second amended and restated credit agreement or new credit agreement provides for  among other things  a million secured revolving credit facility  a million letter of credit sub facility  a million swing line sub facility  all maturing in november  and a new million secured term loan facility maturing in november the new secured term loan facility was used to pay off existing borrowings of million of term debt and provide financing for the acquisition and related transaction costs 
we wrote off million of deferred financing costs  net of accumulated amortization  as a result of the refinancing and incurred financing costs in connection with the new credit agreement of million  which will be amortized over the term of the new credit agreement 
the six year  million  term loan portion of our new credit agreement is subject to quarterly amortization of principal with an amount equal to of the initial aggregate principal amount of the facility payable quarterly through september  except in the case of the initial quarterly payment on june  of and of the initial aggregate principal amount of the facility payable quarterly from december  through december  with any remaining amounts payable in these quarterly payments begin on june  with an initial payment of million 
recent trends it is estimated that from through  the temporary healthcare staffing industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately  growing each year except and in which the industry declined 
table of contents on an annual basis 
during the decline  the locum tenens market was estimated to have grown by approximately and in and  respectively  while the travel nursing staffing market was estimated to have declined by approximately in and it is estimated that from to  the locum tenens and travel nurse staffing markets grew by approximately and  respectively  as compared to the overall temporary healthcare industry growth rate of approximately 
we believe that the growth of the locum tenens market reflects the growing physician shortage  the relative immaturity of the market for temporary physicians  and the financial justification for use of temporary physicians by hospitals and healthcare facilities to generate incremental revenue 
the temporary healthcare staffing industry is expected to grow by approximately in we believe that this expected growth is based on favorable economic conditions and an increase in hospital staff job openings and turnover 
while this growth is positive and is expected to expand the opportunities available to healthcare professionals  the available supply of professionals is not expected to keep pace with the increase in demand 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded goodwill resulting from our past acquisitions 
commencing with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and have performed annual impairment analyses to assess the recoverability of the goodwill and intangible assets  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
upon our annual impairment analyses on december  and december   we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  and million and million  respectively  of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in goodwill and intangible assets is primarily due to our acquisition of mha in november professional liability reserve we maintain an accrual for professional liability self insured retention limits  net of our insurance recoverable  which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating our historical experience and trends  loss reserves established by our insurance carriers and third party administrators  as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies 
we obtain updated actuarial studies on a regular basis that use actual claims data to determine the appropriate reserves for 
table of contents incurred  but not reported  professional liability claims for each year 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for professional liability retention of which and was classified as a current liability  respectively 
the increase in the professional liability accrual was primarily related to the accrual added as a result of the acquisition of mha  offset by payments made for claims related to prior periods 
self insured health insurance claims reserve we maintain an accrual for incurred  but not reported  claims arising from self insured health benefits we provide to our temporary nurse and allied healthcare professionals  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating our historical experience and trends related to both health insurance claims and payments  information provided to us by our insurance broker and third party administrator and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals 
our accrual at december  was based on i a monthly average of our actual historical health insurance claim amounts and ii the average period of time from the date the claim is incurred to the date that it is reported to us and paid 
we believe this is the best estimate of the amount of incurred  but not reported  self insured health benefit claims at year end 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for incurred  but not reported  health insurance claims 
the increase in the accrual was primarily related to an increase in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment 
historically  our accrual for health insurance has been adequate to provide for incurred claims and has fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  changes in our claims experience and changes in the reporting and processing time for claims 
workers compensation reserve we maintain an accrual for workers compensation self insured retention limits  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits and other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by evaluating our historical experience and trends  loss reserves established by our insurance carriers and third party administrators  as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies 
we obtain updated actuarial studies on a semi annual basis that use actual claims data to determine the appropriate reserve both for reported claims and incurred  but not reported  claims for each policy year 
the actuarial study for workers compensation provides us with the estimated losses for prior policy years and an estimated percentage of payroll compensation to be accrued for the current year 
we record our accruals based on the amounts provided in the actuarial study  and we believe this is the best estimate of our liability for reported claims and incurred  but not reported  claims 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  accrued for workers compensation claims  of which million and million was classified as a current liability  respectively 
the increase is due to the fact that claim payments made against the reserve during for the current and prior years lagged behind the additions to the reserve as reserves continue to remain outstanding for workers compensation claims incurred during the course of the last four years 
we have recently experienced a slight decrease in workers compensation rates based on recent favorable historical claims experience that slightly offsets these increases 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated credit losses resulting from collection risks  including the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this results in a provision for bad debt expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reported as a reduction of accounts 
table of contents receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating the credit risk for individual customer receivables  considering the financial condition of each customer and historical payment trends  delinquency trends  credit histories of customers and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be provided 
as of december  and december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to the increase in accounts receivable resulting from the acquisition of mha 
the mha allowance for doubtful accounts of million represents the reserve on new receivables generated from the acquisition date through december  contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include payroll and employee related matters and investigations by governmental agencies regarding our employment practices 
as we become aware of such claims and legal actions  we provide accruals if the exposures are probable and estimable 
if an adverse outcome of such claims and legal actions is reasonably possible  we assess materiality and provide disclosure  as appropriate 
we may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions relating to services provided by our temporary healthcare professionals  and we maintain accruals for these matters if the amounts are probable and estimable 
we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that would be considered reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue 
our results of operations include a nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment and a physician staffing segment 
we completed our acquisition of mha in november  therefore the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  only includes the results of operations of mha and the physician staffing segment since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  reporting segment information would not be meaningful  and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations to be expected in the future

gross profit increased  to million for from million for  representing gross margins of and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in the spread between bill rates and pay rates and the addition of the higher gross margin in the physician staffing segment through the acquisition of mha in november selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation  increased  to million for from million for of the million increase  million was attributable to the acquisition of mha in november  with the remaining million increase primarily attributable to increases in employee expenses from a combination of normal growth in costs per employee and selective headcount additions  partially offset by decreases in professional liability insurance and professional services costs 
non cash stock based compensation 
we recorded non cash compensation charges of million in and million in in connection with our stock option plans to reflect the difference between the fair market value at the measurement date and the exercise prices of previously issued stock options  which are amortized over their respective vesting periods 
the decrease relates to the cancellation and completed vesting of previously issued stock options issued at exercise prices below fair market value 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization expense was million in and million in the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of identifiable amortizable intangible assets obtained from the acquisition of mha in november depreciation expense of million was consistent for and interest expense  net

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation  increased  to million for from million for the million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses related to corporate facilities as we occupied a larger corporate facility for a full year compared to a half year in and corporate employee and professional services increases related to additional compliance requirements in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we recorded an increase in our professional liability insurance reserve as we have experienced negative trends in our malpractice claims development 
these increases were partially offset by a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to vested stock options purchased in our october tender offer that was not incurred during non cash stock based compensation 
we recorded non cash compensation charges of million in and million in in connection with our stock option plans to reflect the difference between the fair market value at the measurement date and the exercise prices of previously issued stock options  which are amortized over their respective vesting periods 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization expense was million in and million in depreciation expense increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to internally developed software placed into service in and and additions of leasehold improvements and assets acquired in connection with the consolidation of several san diego  california locations into a new corporate headquarters facility during the second half of interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  was million for as compared to million for  due primarily to interest charges related to borrowings initiated under our credit facility in october to fund our tender offer and the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with those borrowings 
in addition  interest expense was also higher due to the write off of million of deferred financing costs during related to million in voluntary prepayments on our long term debt 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to million for from million for  reflecting effective income tax rates of and for these periods  respectively 
the reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the state tax provision in liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for acquisitions  working capital requirements and debt service under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
we expect to be able to finance future acquisitions either with cash provided from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  bank loans  debt or equity offerings  or some combination of the foregoing 
the following discussion provides further details of our liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents operating activities historically  our principal working capital need has been for accounts receivable 
at december  and december   our days sales outstanding dso was days and days  respectively 
excluding the impact of the acquisition of mha  dso was days at december  the decrease in dso was related to the acquisition of mha in november  which historically has lower dso than amn  as well as improvements in billing and collection processes 
our principal sources of cash to fund our working capital needs are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations increased million to million in from million in this increase in net cash provided by operations was driven by increased earnings compared to fiscal and the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income taxes

capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our capital expenditures were million for purchased and internally developed software  million for computers  furniture and equipment  leasehold improvements and other expenditures
