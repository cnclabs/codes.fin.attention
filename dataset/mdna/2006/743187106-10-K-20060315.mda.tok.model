adarc 
we have a letter agreement with the aaron diamond aids research center pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to pursue the commercial development  directly or with a partner  of products related to hiv based on patents jointly owned by adarc and us 

table of contents rights and obligations 
we have the right generally to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
we bear the cost of engaging in all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk  columbia for our hiv product candidates subject to the columbia license and the university of chicago for mntx 
under our collaboration agreement  wyeth has the right  at its expense  to defend and enforce the mntx patents licensed to wyeth by us 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under certain circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
the licenses to which we are a party impose various milestone  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other payment  insurance  indemnification and other obligations on us and are subject to certain reservations of rights 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the termination of the applicable agreement  which would likely cause us to terminate the related development program and cause a complete loss of our investment in that program 
patents and proprietary technology our policy is to protect our proprietary technology  and we consider the protection of our rights to be important to our business 
in addition to seeking us patent protection for many of our inventions  we generally file patent applications in canada  japan  european countries that are party to the european patent convention and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to protect the inventions that we consider to be important to the development of our foreign business 
generally  patents issued in the us are effective for the longer of years from the date of issue or years from the earliest asserted filing date of the corresponding patent application  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest asserted filing date of the corresponding patent application  if the application was filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  the patent term can be extended up to a maximum of five years to recapture a portion of the term during which the fda regulatory review was being conducted 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law  although most countries provide for patent terms of years from the earliest asserted filing date and allow patent extensions similar to those permitted in the us we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas 
we generally require our employees  consultants and corporate partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements 
currently our patent portfolio relating to our proprietary technologies in the symptom management and supportive care  hiv and cancer areas is comprised  on a worldwide basis  of patents that have been issued and pending patent applications  which we either own directly or of which we are the exclusive licensee 
our issued patents expire on dates ranging from through in addition  psma llc owns directly or is the exclusive licensee of six patents that have been issued and pending patent applications 
psma llc s issued patents expire on dates ranging from to patent term extensions and pending patent applications may extend the period of patent protection afforded our products in development 
we are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing 
for example  we are aware of other groups investigating methylnaltrexone and other peripheral opioid antagonists  psma or related compounds and ccr monoclonal antibodies and of patents held  and patent applications filed  by these groups in those areas 
while the validity of issued patents  patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain  if asserted against us  any related patent rights could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involve alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend upon subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and it is possible that to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products we will need to obtain a license to a patent  which would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 

table of contents government regulation progenics and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the food and drug administration in the us and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  recordkeeping  advertising and promotion of our products 
none of our product candidates has received marketing or other approval from the fda or any other similar regulatory authority 
fda approval of our products  including a review of the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce such products  will be required before such products may be marketed in the us the process of obtaining approvals from the fda can be costly  time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays 
we cannot assure you that approvals of our proposed products  processes  or facilities will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if we experience delays in obtaining  or do not obtain  approvals for our products  commercialization of our products would be slowed or stopped 
moreover  even if we obtain regulatory approval  the approval may include significant limitations on indicated uses for which the product could be marketed or other significant marketing restrictions 
the process required by the fda before our products may be approved for marketing in the us generally involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication  submission to the fda of a marketing application  and fda review of the marketing application in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to gain preliminary information about a product s pharmacology and toxicology and to identify any safety problems that would preclude testing in humans 
products must generally be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices  and preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practices 
the results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind investigational new drug application 
an ind is a submission which the sponsor of a clinical trial of an investigational new drug must make to the fda and which must become effective before clinical trials may commence 
the ind submission must include  among other things a description of the sponsor s investigational plan  protocols for each planned study  chemistry  manufacturing  and control information  pharmacology and toxicology information  and a summary of previous human experience with the investigational drug 
unless the fda objects to  makes comments to or raises questions concerning an ind  the ind will become effective days following its receipt by the fda  and initial clinical studies may begin  although companies often obtain affirmative fda approval before beginning such studies 
we cannot assure you that submission of an ind by us will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
a new drug application  or nda  is an application to the fda to market a new drug 
the nda must contain  among other things  information on chemistry  manufacturing  and controls  non clinical pharmacology and toxicology  
table of contents human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability  and clinical data 
the new drug may not be marketed in the us until the fda has approved the nda 
a biologic license application  or bla  is an application to the fda to market a biological product 
the bla must contain  among other things  data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the product meets prescribed standards of safety  purity and potency  and a full description of manufacturing methods 
the biological product may not be marketed in the us until a biologic license is issued 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practice requirements under protocols that detail  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety  and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board 
the institutional review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects  the possible liability of the institution and the informed consent disclosure which must be made to participants in the clinical trial 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap 
during phase  when the drug is initially administered to human subjects  the product is tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a new product is found to have an effect and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluation  phase trials are undertaken in order to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population 
the fda may suspend clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies  the chemistry and manufacturing data  and the proposed labeling  among other things  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla  approval of which must be obtained prior to commencement of commercial sales 
the fda may refuse to accept the application for filing if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied  and even after accepting the application for review  the fda may require additional testing or information before approval of the application 
our analysis of the results of our clinical studies is subject to review and interpretation by the fda  which may differ from our analysis 
we cannot assure you that our data or our interpretation of data will be accepted by the fda 
in any event  the fda must deny an nda or bla if applicable regulatory requirements are not ultimately satisfied 
in addition  we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in applicable law or fda policy during the period of product development and fda regulatory review 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be made subject to various conditions  including post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product  or may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
finally  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
both before and after approval is obtained  a product  its manufacturer  and the sponsor of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage  including the preclinical and clinical testing process  the approval process  or thereafter  may result in various adverse consequences  including fda delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or sponsor 
in addition  later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such product  manufacturer  or sponsor  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 

table of contents whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable government regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to marketing such product in such countries 
the approval procedure varies from country to country  and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
although there are some procedures for unified filing for certain european countries  in general  each country has its own procedures and requirements 
we do not currently have any facilities or personnel outside of the us in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and various other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling  using and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contaminations or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any legal and regulatory violations as well as damages that result 
any such liability could have a material adverse effect on progenics 
manufacturing we currently rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
we believe that our existing arrangements with such single source third party manufacturers are reliable and adequate for the balance of our clinical trial and initial commercial supply requirements 
we will transfer to wyeth  at a mutually agreeable time  any existing supply agreements with third parties for mntx 
in march  we entered into an agreement with mallinckrodt inc for the supply of the bulk form of mntx 
the contract provides for mallinckrodt to supply product based on a rolling forecast to be provided by us to mallinckrodt with respect to our anticipated needs and for the purchase by us of product on specified pricing terms 
under this agreement  we are obligated to purchase a portion of our requirements for bulk form mntx from mallinckrodt  although we have no set minimum purchase obligation 
product supplied to us by mallinckrodt is required to satisfy technical specifications agreed to by us 
the contract term extends to january  and renews automatically thereafter for successive one year terms unless either party provides prior notice to the other 
prior to its expiration  the contract may be terminated by either party upon a material breach by the other party or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy or insolvency events 
we currently manufacture pro  gmk and protein vaccines in our biologics pilot production facilities in tarrytown  new york 
we currently have one liter bioreactor in operation and are in the process of installing a second liter bioreactor to increase our manufacturing capacity in support of our clinical programs 
we have also acquired a  liter bioreactor  and we are considering the appropriate time and manner for installing and deploying this additional resource 
we believe that our existing production facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials for these product candidates 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for all of our late stage clinical trials for these product candidates and would be insufficient for commercial scale requirements 
we may be required to further expand our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with third parties or corporate collaborators to assist with production 
in order to establish a full scale commercial manufacturing facility for any of our product candidates  we would need to spend substantial additional funds  hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with the extensive fda regulations applicable to such a facility 
sales and marketing we plan to market products for which we obtain regulatory approval through co marketing  co promotion  licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
under the terms of our collaboration agreement with wyeth  wyeth granted us an option the co promotion option to enter into a co promotion agreement to co promote any of the mntx products developed under the collaboration agreement  subject to certain conditions 
the extent of our co promotion activities and the fee that we will be paid by wyeth for these activities  will be established when we exercise our option 
wyeth will record all sales of products worldwide including those sold by us  if any  under a co promotion agreement 
in addition  cytogen has certain marketing rights with respect to the psma product candidates 

table of contents competition competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and characterized by ongoing research and development and technological change 
we face competition from many companies and major universities and research institutions in the us and abroad 
we will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  experience in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  operating experience  research and development and marketing capabilities and production capabilities than we do 
our products under development may not compete successfully with existing products or products under development by other companies  universities and other institutions 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda marketing approval for products more rapidly than we do 
drug manufacturers that are first in the market with a therapeutic for a specific indication generally obtain and maintain a significant competitive advantage over later entrants 
accordingly  we believe that the speed with which we develop products  complete the clinical trials and approval processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important competitive factor 
with respect to mntx  there are currently no fda approved products for reversing the debilitating side effects of opioid pain therapy or for the treatment of post operative bowel dysfunction 
we are  however  aware of a product candidate that targets these therapeutic indications 
this product  entereg alvimopan  is under development by adolor corporation  in collaboration with an affiliate of glaxosmith kline plc 
entereg is in advanced clinical development and adolor has received an approvable letter from the us food and drug administration for entereg regarding the treatment of post operative ileus 
we believe  however  that entereg s effects are limited to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract  whereas mntx is available systemically outside of the central nervous system 
additionally  it has been reported that a european specialty pharmaceutical company is in early clinical development of an oral formulation of methylnaltrexone for use in opioid induced constipation 
with respect to our products for the treatment of hiv infection  three classes of products made by our competitors have been approved for marketing by the fda for the treatment of hiv infection and aids reverse transcriptase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and entry inhibitors 
these drugs have shown efficacy in reducing the concentration of hiv in the blood and prolonging asymptomatic periods in hiv positive individuals  especially when administered in combination 
we are aware of several competitors that are developing alternative treatments for hiv infection  including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies  some of which are directed against ccr with respect to gmk  the fda and certain other regulatory authorities have approved high dose alpha interferon for marketing as a treatment for patients with high risk melanoma 
high dose alpha interferon has demonstrated efficacy for this indication 
with respect to the immunotherapeutic products based on psma that we have been developing through psma llc  there are traditional forms of treatment for prostate cancer such as radiation and surgery 
however  if the disease spreads  these forms of treatment can be ineffective 
we are aware of several competitors who are developing alternative treatments for prostate cancer  including in vivo and ex vivo immunotherapies  some of which are directed against psma 
a significant amount of research in the biopharmaceutical field is also being carried out at academic and government institutions 
an element of our research and development strategy is to in license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions 
these institutions are becoming increasingly sensitive to the commercial value of their findings and are becoming more aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
these institutions may also market competitive commercial products on their own or in collaboration with competitors and will compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
any resulting increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions may adversely affect our business strategy 
competition with respect to our technologies and product candidates is and will be based  among other things  on efficacy and safety of our products  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product reliability and availability  sales  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  
table of contents capabilities of our collaborators  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  degree of clinical benefits of our product candidates relative to their costs  method of administering a product  price  and patent protection 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and to secure sufficient capital resources for the typically substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
competitive disadvantages in any of these factors could materially harm our business and financial condition 
product liability the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
to the extent we elect to test  manufacture or market products independently  we will bear the risk of product liability directly 
we have obtained product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million aggregate limitation 
in addition  where the local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to continue to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost  or in adequate amounts 
human resources at december   we had full time employees  of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold phd degrees and four of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold mddegrees 
at such date  employees were engaged in research and development  medical and regulatory affairs and manufacturing activities and were engaged in finance  legal  administration and business development 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business and operations entail a variety of serious risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our product development programs are inherently risky 
we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies 
our mntx product candidate  which is designed to reverse certain side effects induced by opioids and to treat post operative bowel dysfunction and is being developed through a collaboration with wyeth  is based on a novel method of action that has not yet been proven to be safe or effective 
no drug with mntx s method of action has ever received marketing approval 
additionally  some of our hiv product candidates are designed to be effective by blocking viral entry  and our gmk product candidate is designed to be a therapeutic cancer vaccine 
to our knowledge  no drug designed to treat hiv infection by blocking viral entry with one exception and no cancer therapeutic vaccine has been approved for marketing in the us our other research and development programs  and those conducted through psma llc  involve similarly novel approaches to human therapeutics 
consequently  there is little precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies 
there are a number of technological challenges that we must overcome to complete most of our development efforts 
we may not be able to develop successfully any of our products 
we have granted to wyeth the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mntx  our lead product candidate  and our resulting dependence on wyeth exposes us to significant risks 
in december  we entered into a license and co development agreement with wyeth 
under this agreement  we granted to wyeth the exclusive worldwide right to develop and commercialize mntx  our lead product candidate 
as a result  we are dependent on wyeth to perform and fund development  including clinical testing  to make certain regulatory filings and to manufacture and market products containing mntx 
our collaboration with wyeth may not be scientifically  clinically or commercially successful 
any revenues from the sale of mntx  if approved for sale by the fda  will depend almost entirely on the efforts of wyeth 
wyeth has significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources it applies to sales of the mntx products and may not be effective in marketing such products 
in addition  wyeth is a large  diversified pharmaceutical company with global operations and its own corporate objectives  which may not be consistent with our best interests 
for example  wyeth may change its strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced revenues to us 
in addition  we will receive milestone and contingent payments from wyeth only if mntx achieves specified clinical  regulatory and commercialization milestones  and we will receive royalty payments from wyeth only if mntx receives regulatory approval and is commercialized by wyeth 
many of these milestone events will depend on the efforts of wyeth 
we may not receive any milestone  contingent or royalty payments from wyeth 
the collaboration agreement extends  unless terminated earlier  on a country by country and product by product basis  until the last to expire royalty period  as defined  for any product 
progenics may terminate the collaboration agreement at any time upon days of written notice to wyeth days in the case of breach of a payment obligation upon material breach that is not cured 
wyeth may  with or without cause  following the second anniversary of the first commercial sale  as defined  of the first commercial product in the us  terminate the collaboration agreement by providing progenics with at least days prior written notice of such termination 
wyeth may also terminate the agreement i upon days written notice following one or more serious safety or efficacy issues that arise  as defined  and ii at any time  upon days written notice of a material breach that is not cured by progenics 
upon termination of the collaboration agreement  the ownership of the license we granted to wyeth will depend on the party that initiates the termination and the reason for the termination 
if our relationship with wyeth were to terminate  we would have to either enter into a license and co development agreement with another party or develop and commercialize mntx ourselves 
we may not be able to enter into such an agreement with another suitable company on acceptable terms or at all 
to develop and commercialize mntx on our own  we would have to develop a sales and marketing organization and a distribution infrastructure  neither of which we currently have 
developing these resources would be an expensive and lengthy process and would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
moreover  a termination of our relationship with wyeth could seriously compromise the development program for mntx 
for example  we could experience significant delays in the development of mntx and would have to assume full funding and other responsibility for further development and eventual commercialization 
any of these outcomes would result in delays in our ability to distribute mntx and would increase our expenses  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our collaboration with wyeth is multi faceted and involves a complex sharing of control over decisions  responsibilities  costs and benefits 
there are numerous potential sources of disagreement between us and wyeth  including with respect to product development  marketing strategies  manufacturing and supply issues and rights relating to intellectual property 
wyeth has significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do  which it could draw upon in the event of a dispute 
a disagreement between wyeth and us could lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings as well as to extensive financial and operational consequences to us  and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if testing does not yield successful results  our products will not be approved 
we will need to obtain regulatory approval before we can market our product candidates 
to obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities  we or our collaborators must demonstrate a product s safety and efficacy through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
numerous adverse events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  potential products may not have the desired efficacy or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude marketing approval or limit their commercial use if approved  after reviewing test results  we or our collaborators may abandon projects  which we previously believed to be promising  and we  our collaborators or regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if we or they believe that the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
clinical testing is very expensive and can take many years 
results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials 
in addition  many of our products  such as pro and the psma product candidates  are at an early stage of development 
the successful commercialization of early stage products will require significant further research  development  testing  approvals by regulators and additional investment 
our products in the research or preclinical development stage may not yield results that would permit or justify clinical testing 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under development would delay or prevent marketing approval of the product  which could adversely affect our operating results and credibility 
a setback in our clinical development programs could adversely affect us 
we have successfully completed two pivotal phase clinical trials of subcutaneous mntx for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced medical illness 
we are now working with our collaborator wyeth to submit a new drug application to the us food and drug administration to market subcutaneous mntx 
we also have successfully completed a phase clinical trial of intravenous mntx in patients at risk for post operative bowel dysfunction 
based on our end of phase meeting with the fda  we are planning a phase clinical program for treatment of post operative bowel dysfunction 
we had completed phase clinical trials of oral mntx in healthy volunteers prior to our collaboration agreement with wyeth 
wyeth is responsible for the worldwide development of oral mntx and will conduct additional clinical trials of oral mntx in chronic pain patients who experience opioid induced constipation 
if the results of any of these ongoing trials are not satisfactory  or if we encounter problems enrolling patients  or if clinical trial supply issues or other difficulties arise  our entire mntx development program could be adversely affected  resulting in delays in commencing or completing clinical trials or in making our regulatory filing for marketing approval 
the need to conduct additional clinical trials or significant revisions to our clinical development plan would lead to delays in filing for the regulatory approvals necessary to market mntx 
if the clinical trials indicate a serious problem with the safety or efficacy of an mntx product  then wyeth has the right under our license and co development agreement to terminate the agreement or to stop the development or commercialization of the affected products 
since mntx is our most clinically advanced product  any setback of these types would have a material adverse effect on our stock price and business 
we also have two ongoing pivotal phase clinical trials for gmk 
in may  our collaborating research cooperative group in one of these trials  ecog  recommended to clinical investigators participating in the trial that they discontinue administering gmk  and as a result that trial did not complete patient dosing as contemplated by the initial trial protocol 
a second pivotal phase trial for gmk was initiated in may and full enrollment of  patients has been completed 
we expect to assess the recurrence of cancer and overall survival of the study patients over the next several years 
if the results of either of the gmk trials are not satisfactory  we may need to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our gmk program 
we have announced positive phase clinical findings related to pro  and we have initiated an additional phase b clinical trial 
if the results of our phase b study with pro or the preclinical and clinical studies involving the psma vaccine and antibody candidates are not satisfactory  we would need to reconfigure our clinical trial programs to conduct additional trials or abandon the program involved 

table of contents we have a history of operating losses  and we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have derived no significant revenues from product sales or royalties 
we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for a number of years  if ever  other than potential revenues from mntx 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  which could increase significantly as we expand our clinical trial programs and other product development efforts 
our ability to achieve and sustain profitability is dependent in part on obtaining regulatory approval to market our products and then commercializing  either alone or with others  our products 
we may not be able to develop and commercialize products 
moreover  our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
we are likely to need additional financing  but our access to capital funding is uncertain 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million 
in december  we received a million upfront payment from wyeth in connection with the signing of the license and co development agreement relating to mntx 
during the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  under our agreement with wyeth  wyeth is responsible for all future development and commercialization costs relating to mntx starting january  as a result  we expect that our spending on mntx in and beyond will drop significantly from the amounts expended in with regard to our other product candidates  however  we expect that we will continue to incur significant expenditures for their development and we do not have committed external sources of funding for most of these projects 
these expenditures will be funded from our cash on hand  or we may seek additional external funding for these expenditures  most likely through collaborative agreements  or other license or sale transactions  with one or more pharmaceutical companies  through the issuance and sale of securities or through additional government grants or contracts 
we cannot predict with any certainty when we will need additional funds or how much we will need or if additional funds will be available to us 
our need for future funding will depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside our control 
our access to capital funding is uncertain 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
if we raise funds by issuing and selling securities  it may be on terms that are not favorable to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity securities  our current stockholders will be diluted  and new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
if we raise funds by selling debt securities  we could be subject to restrictive covenants and significant repayment obligations 
our clinical trials could take longer than we expect 
although for planning purposes we forecast the commencement and completion of clinical trials  and have included many of those forecasts in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and in other public disclosures  the actual timing of these events can vary dramatically 
for example  we have experienced delays in our mntx clinical development program in the past as a result of slower than anticipated patient enrollment 
these delays may recur 
delays can be caused by  among other things deaths or other adverse medical events involving patients or subjects in our clinical trials  regulatory or patent issues  interim or final results of ongoing clinical trials  failure to enroll clinical sites as expected  competition for enrollment from clinical trials conducted by others in similar indications  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  and manufacturing problems 

table of contents in addition  we may need to delay or suspend our clinical trials if we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed 
clinical trials involving our product candidates may not commence or be completed as forecasted 
although work on the psma projects continues  our clinical programs involving psma llc could also be delayed by disagreements between cytogen and us concerning funding development programs or other matters 
psma llc currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to psma llc 
moreover  we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials  and we rely on others to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of some of our clinical trials 
in addition  certain clinical trials for our products may be conducted by government sponsored agencies  and consequently will be dependent on governmental participation and funding 
under our agreement with wyeth relating to mntx  wyeth has the responsibility to conduct some of the clinical trials for that product candidate  including all trials outside of the united states 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
as a result of these and other factors  our clinical trials may not commence or be completed as we expect or may not be conducted successfully  in which event investors confidence in our ability to develop products may be impaired and our stock price may decline 
we are subject to extensive regulation  which can be costly and time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated fines and delays 
we and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda in the us and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
if we violate regulatory requirements at any stage  whether before or after marketing approval is obtained  we may be subject to forced removal of a product from the market  product seizure  civil and criminal penalties and other adverse consequences 
our products do not yet have  and may never obtain  the regulatory approvals needed for marketing 
none of our products has been approved by applicable regulatory authorities for marketing 
the process of obtaining fda and foreign regulatory approvals often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications and other submissions necessary to gain marketing approvals 
our products under development may never obtain the marketing approval from the fda or any other regulatory authority necessary for commercialization 
even if our products receive regulatory approval they might not obtain labeling claims necessary to make the product commercially viable in general  labeling claims define the medical conditions for which a drug product may be marketed  and are therefore very important to the commercial success of a product  we or our collaborators might be required to undertake post marketing trials to verify the product s efficacy or safety  we  our collaborators or others might identify side effects after the product is on the market  or we or our collaborators might experience manufacturing problems  either of which could result in subsequent withdrawal of marketing approval  reformulation of the product  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  changes in labeling of the product or the need for additional marketing applications  and we and our collaborators will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continuous regulatory review 
if our products fail to receive marketing approval or lose previously received approvals  our financial results would be adversely affected 

table of contents even if our products obtain marketing approval  they might not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
if health care providers believe that patients can be managed adequately with alternative  currently available therapies  they may not prescribe our products  especially if the alternative therapies are viewed as more effective  as having a better safety or tolerability profile  as being more convenient to the patient or health care providers or as being less expensive 
for pharmaceuticals administered in an institutional setting  the ability of the institution to be adequately reimbursed could also play a significant role in demand for our products 
even if our products obtain marketing approval  they may not achieve market acceptance 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
marketplace acceptance will depend in part on competition in our industry  which is intense 
the extent to which any of our products achieves market acceptance will depend on competitive factors 
competition in our industry is intense  and it is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
there are products currently in the market that will compete with the products that we are developing  including aids drugs and chemotherapy drugs for treating cancer 
as described below  adolor corporation is developing a drug that would compete with mntx 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
these competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing and render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if our product candidates receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our operating results and financial position would suffer 
one or more competitors developing an opioid antagonist may reach the market ahead of us and adversely affect the market potential for mntx 
we are aware that adolor corporation  in collaboration with glaxo group limited  or glaxo  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  is developing an opioid antagonist  entereg alvimopan  for post operative ileus  which has completed phase clinical trials  and for opioid induced bowel dysfunction  which is in phase clinical trials post operative ileus is a condition similar to post operative bowel dysfunction  a condition for which we are developing mntx 
entereg is further along in the clinical development process than mntx  and adolor corporation has received an approvable letter from the us food and drug administration for entereg regarding the treatment of post operative ileus 
additionally  it has been reported that a european specialty pharmaceutical company is in clinical development of an oral formulation of methylnaltrexone for use in opioid induced constipation 
if either of these products reaches the market before mntx  it could achieve a significant competitive advantage relative to our product 
in any event  the considerable marketing and sales capabilities of glaxo may impair our ability to penetrate the market 
under the terms of our collaboration with wyeth with respect to mntx  wyeth will develop the oral form of mntx worldwide 
we will lead the us development of the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of mntx  while wyeth will lead development of these parenteral products outside the us wyeth and we will pursue an integrated strategy to optimize worldwide development  regulatory approval  and commercial launch of the three mntx products  which may impact timelines for the development of mntx previously disclosed by us 
decisions regarding the timelines for development of the three mntx products will be made by a joint development committee formed under the terms of the license and co development agreement  consisting of members from both wyeth and progenics 
disputes with cytogen could delay or halt our psma programs 
our research and development programs relating to vaccine and antibody immunotherapeutics based on psma are conducted through psma llc  a joint venture between cytogen corporation and us 
this is a joint venture  meaning that our ownership rights in the programs  funding obligations and governance rights are equal 
as a result  for psma llc to operate efficiently  and for the research and development programs to be adequately funded and staffed and productive  we and cytogen must be in agreement on strategic and operational matters 
there is a significant risk that  as a result of differing views and priorities  there will be occasions when we do not agree on various matters  as is the case currently 
our level of commitment to fund psma llc and that of our joint venture partner  cytogen  is based upon a budget and work plan that are developed and approved annually by the parties 
we have in the past experienced delays in reaching agreement with cytogen regarding annual budget issues and strategic and operational matters relating to psma llc 
psma llc currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to psma llc 
if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  we would likely experience delays in advancing the psma programs and may need to dissolve psma llc and abandon the psma programs being conducted by psma llc 
we may not reach an agreement with cytogen on these matters 

table of contents if we are unable to negotiate collaborative agreements  our cash burn rate could increase and our rate of product development could decrease 
our business strategy includes as an element entering into collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and commercialize our products and technologies 
we recently entered into such a collaboration with wyeth 
however  we may not be successful in negotiating additional collaborative arrangements 
if we do not enter into new collaborative arrangements  we would have to devote more of our resources to clinical product development and product launch activities  and our cash burn rate would increase or we would need to take steps to reduce our rate of product development 
if we do not remedy our failure to achieve milestones or satisfy conditions regarding some of our product candidates  we may not maintain our rights under our licenses relating to these product candidates 
we are required to make substantial cash payments  achieve specified milestones and satisfy other conditions  including filing for and obtaining marketing approvals and introducing products  to maintain rights under our intellectual property licenses 
we may not be able to maintain our rights under these licenses 
under our license agreements with sloan kettering institute for cancer research relating to gmk  we are required  among other things  to have filed for marketing approval for a drug by and to have commenced commercialization of the drug by 
we have not achieved these and other milestones and are unlikely to achieve them soon 
we are in a similar position with respect to our license agreement with antigenics inc concerning qs tm  a component of gmk 
if we can establish that our failure to achieve these milestones resulted from technical issues beyond our control or delays in clinical studies that could not have been reasonably avoided  we may be entitled to a revision of these milestone dates 
although we believe that we satisfy one or more of these conditions  we may become involved in disputes with our licensors as to our continued right to a license 
in addition  at september  we became obligated under our license agreement with columbia to pay columbia  we have accrued this amount but  pending the outcome of discussions with columbia regarding this payment and other matters relating to the license  we have not yet paid it 
if we do not comply with our obligations under our license agreements  the licensors may terminate them 
termination of any of our licenses could result in our losing our rights to  and therefore being unable to commercialize  any related product 
we have had discussions with sloan kettering and columbia to reach agreement on the revision of applicable milestone dates 
we may not  however  reach agreement with these licensors in a manner favorable to us 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which could adversely impact our ability to commercialize products 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which may result in increased costs of production or delay product development or commercialization 
in order to commercialize our product candidates successfully  we or our collaborators must be able to manufacture products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our product candidates can be complex  difficult to accomplish even in small quantities  difficult to scale up for large scale production and subject to delays  inefficiencies and low yields of quality products 
the cost of manufacturing some of our products may make them prohibitively expensive 
if adequate supplies of any of our product candidates or related materials are not available to us on a timely basis or at all  our clinical trials could be seriously delayed  since these materials are time consuming to manufacture and cannot be readily obtained from third party sources 
we operate pilot scale manufacturing facilities for the production of vaccines and recombinant proteins 
we believe that  for these types of product candidates  these facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for late stage clinical trials for these types of product candidates  and would be insufficient for commercial scale manufacturing requirements 
we may be required to expand further our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with production 
in the event that we decide to establish a commercial scale manufacturing facility  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations  which are extensive 
we may not be able to build a manufacturing facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our clinical trials or commercial scale manufacturing 
we have entered into arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of some of our products 
our third party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost effective means for manufacturing products 
in employing third party manufacturers  we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process  including compliance by these third parties with the fda s current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory requirements 
we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes  and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs 

table of contents we are dependent on our patents and other intellectual property rights 
the validity  enforceability and commercial value of these rights are highly uncertain 
our success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patent and other intellectual property rights 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves many complex legal and technical issues 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed  or the degree of protection afforded  under patents in this area 
accordingly  the patent applications owned by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued 
we are aware of other groups that have patent applications or patents containing claims similar to or overlapping those in our patents and patent applications 
we do not expect to know for several years the relative strength or scope of our patent position as compared to these other groups 
furthermore  patents that we own or license may not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs  and consequently may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage 
we own or have licenses to several issued patents 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the patent office can be challenged in litigation 
our patents may be successfully challenged 
moreover  we may incur substantial costs in litigation to uphold the validity of patents or to prevent infringement 
if the outcome of litigation is adverse to us  third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us 
moreover  third parties may avoid our patents through design innovation 
most of our product candidates  including mntx  pro  gmk and our psma program products  incorporate to some degree intellectual property licensed from third parties 
we can lose the right to patents and other intellectual property licensed to us if the related license agreement is terminated due to a breach by us or otherwise 
our ability  and that of our collaboration partners  to commercialize products incorporating licensed intellectual property would be impaired if the related license agreements were terminated 
generally  we have the right to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
in addition  our license agreement with the university of chicago regarding mntx gives us the right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patents 
we bear the cost of engaging in some or all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk and the university of chicago for mntx 
under our collaboration agreement  wyeth has the right  at its expense  to defend and enforce the mntx patents licensed to wyeth by us 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under specified circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our technology or disclose our technology  and we may be unable to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information 
if we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  we may need to alter or terminate a product development program 
there may be patent or other intellectual property rights belonging to others that require us to alter our products  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities 
if our products infringe patent or other intellectual property rights of others  the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
we may not prevail in any action brought against us  and any license required under any rights that we infringe may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing 
for example  we are aware of other groups investigating methylnaltrexone and other peripheral opioid antagonists  psma or related compounds and ccr monoclonal antibodies and of patents held  and patent applications filed  by these groups in those areas 
while the validity of these issued patents  patentability of these pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain  if asserted against us  any related patent or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involve alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend on subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and we may need to obtain a license to a patent in order to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products 
the need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 

table of contents we are dependent upon third parties for a variety of functions 
these arrangements may not provide us with the benefits we expect 
we rely in part on third parties to perform a variety of functions 
we are party to numerous agreements which place substantial responsibility on clinical research organizations  consultants and other service providers for the development of our products 
we also rely on medical and academic institutions to perform aspects of our clinical trials of product candidates 
in addition  an element of our research and development strategy is to in license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions in order to minimize investments in early research 
furthermore  we recently entered into an agreement under which we will depend on wyeth for the commercialization and development of mntx  our lead product candidate 
we may not be able to maintain any of these relationships or establish new ones on beneficial terms 
furthermore  we may not be able to enter new arrangements without undue delays or expenditures  and these arrangements may not allow us to compete successfully 
we lack sales and marketing experience  which will make us dependent on third parties for their expertise in this area 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
if we receive marketing approval  we expect to market and sell our products principally through distribution  co marketing  co promotion or licensing arrangements with third parties 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
under our license and co development agreement with wyeth  wyeth is responsible for commercializing mntx 
to the extent that we enter into distribution  co marketing  co promotion  detailing or licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our other products  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources these third parties devote to our products 
in addition  if we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to develop an internal sales force 
we may not be able to establish a successful sales force should we choose to do so 
if we lose key management and scientific personnel on whom we depend  our business could suffer 
we are dependent upon our key management and scientific personnel 
in particular  the loss of dr 
paul j 
maddon  our chief executive officer and chief science officer  could cause our management and operations to suffer 
we have an employment agreement with dr 
maddon  the initial term of which ran through june   which was automatically renewed for an additional period of two years 
see item executive compensation employment agreements in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  we are currently in discussions with dr 
maddon regarding the future renewal of his employment agreement 
employment agreements do not  however  assure the continued employment of an employee 
we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
maddon in the amount of million 
competition for qualified employees among companies in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we may be required to expand substantially our personnel  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and marketing 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the raw and bulk materials needed to make our products  our product development and commercialization could be slowed or stopped 
we currently obtain supplies of critical raw materials used in production of mntx  gmk and other of our product candidates from single sources 
in particular  we rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
we have a supply agreement with mallinckrodt inc  our current supplier of bulk form mntx  which has an initial term that expires on january  in accordance with our collaboration agreement with wyeth  we will transfer to wyeth  at a mutually agreeable time  the responsibility for manufacturing mntx for clinical and commercial use  including our supply agreements with third parties 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our other suppliers 
in addition  commercialization of gmk requires an adjuvant  qs tm  available only from antigenics inc our existing arrangements may not result in the supply of sufficient quantities of our product candidates needed to accomplish our clinical development programs  and we may not have the right or capability to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet our needs if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to do so 
any delay or disruption in the availability of raw materials would slow or stop product development and commercialization of the relevant product 
table of contents a substantial portion of our funding comes from federal government grants and research contracts 
we cannot rely on these grants or contracts as a continuing source of funds 
a substantial portion of our revenues to date has been derived from federal government grants and research contracts 
in july and september  we were awarded a million and a million grant from the nih to partially fund our hepatitis c virus and pro programs  respectively 
also  in we were awarded  in the aggregate  approximately million in nih grants and research contracts in addition to previous years awards 
we cannot rely on grants or additional contracts as a continuing source of funds 
moreover  funds available under these grants and contracts must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the government rather than for all our programs generally 
for example  the million contract awarded to us by the nih in september must be used by us in furtherance of our efforts to develop an hiv vaccine 
the government s obligation to make payments under these grants and contracts is subject to appropriation by the us congress for funding in each year 
moreover  it is possible that congress or the government agencies that administer these government research programs will decide to scale back these programs or terminate them due to their own budgetary constraints 
additionally  these grants and research contracts are subject to adjustment based upon the results of periodic audits performed on behalf of the granting authority 
consequently  the government may not award grants or research contracts to us in the future  and any amounts that we derive from existing grants or contracts may be less than those received to date 
if health care reform measures are enacted  our operating results and our ability to commercialize products could be adversely affected 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in some foreign countries  particularly countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in addition  as a result of the trend towards managed health care in the us  as well as legislative proposals to reduce government insurance programs  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
if we or any of our collaborators succeed in bringing one or more of our products to market  third party payors may establish and maintain price levels insufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
significant changes in the health care system in the us or elsewhere  including changes resulting from adverse trends in third party reimbursement programs  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to raise capital and commercialize products 
we are exposed to product liability claims  and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance against these claims at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business exposes us to product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
we may not be able to avoid product liability exposure 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us  our financial position may be adversely affected 
product liability insurance for the biopharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  when available at all 
we have obtained product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million annual aggregate limitation 
in addition  where local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or where local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
our present insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims brought against us 
in addition  some of our license and other agreements require us to obtain product liability insurance 
adequate insurance coverage may not be available to us at a reasonable cost in the future 
we handle hazardous materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
if we are involved in a hazardous waste spill or other accident  we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
our research and development work and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous  controlled and radioactive materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
despite procedures that we implement for handling and disposing of these materials  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of a hazardous waste spill or other accident  we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future

at december   dr 
maddon and stockholders affiliated with tudor investment corporation together beneficially own or control approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
these persons  should they choose to act together  could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
we commenced principal operations in late  and since that time we have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
we do not currently have any commercial products 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we will need to address a number of technological and clinical challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of funds that we will require  or the length of time that will pass  before we receive significant revenues from sales of any of our products  if ever 
our most advanced product candidate and likeliest source of product revenue is methynaltrexone mntx 
in december  we entered into a license and co development agreement the collaboration agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals wyeth to develop and commercialize mntx 
in collaboration with wyeth  we are conducting a broad clinical development program for mntx in several settings involving symptom management and supportive care 
under the terms of our collaboration with wyeth  wyeth is developing the oral form of mntx worldwide 
we are leading the us development of the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of mntx  while wyeth is leading development of these parenteral products outside the us wyeth and we are pursuing an integrated strategy to optimize worldwide development  regulatory approval  and commercial launch of the three mntx products  which may impact timelines for the development of mntx previously disclosed by us 
decisions regarding the timelines for development of the three mntx products will be made by a joint development committee formed under the terms of the license and co development agreement  consisting of members from both wyeth and progenics 
our work with mntx has proceeded farthest as a treatment for opioid induced constipation 
constipation is a serious medical problem for patients who are being treated with opioid pain relief medications 
mntx is designed to reverse the side effects of opioid pain medications while maintaining pain relief  an important need not currently met by any approved drugs 
we have successfully completed two pivotal phase clinical trials of the subcutaneous form of mntx in patients with advanced medical illness  including cancer  aids and heart disease 
we achieved positive results from our two pivotal phase clinical trials mntx and mntx 
all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of both of the phase studies were positive and statistically significant 
the drug was generally well tolerated in both phase trials 
we are now working with our alliance partner  wyeth  to submit a new drug application to the us food and drug administration and implement a commercialization strategy 
we are also developing an intravenous form of mntx in collaboration with wyeth for the management of post operative bowel dysfunction  a serious condition of the gastrointestinal tract 
we have successfully completed a phase clinical trial of mntx for this indication 
based upon our end of phase meeting with the fda  we are planning a phase clinical program with intravenous mntx for the treatment of post operative bowel dysfunction 
under the collaboration agreement  wyeth is also developing oral mntx for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic pain 
prior to the collaboration agreement  we had completed phase clinical trials of oral mntx in healthy volunteers  which indicated that mntx was well tolerated 
in the area of virology  we are developing viral entry inhibitors  which are molecules designed to inhibit the virus ability to enter certain types of immune system cells 
hiv is the virus that causes aids 
receptors and co receptors are structures on the surface of a cell to which a virus must bind in order to infect the cell 
in mid  we announced positive phase clinical findings related to pro  a monoclonal antibody designed to target the hiv co receptor ccr  in healthy volunteers 
a phase b trial of pro in hiv infected patients began in december in addition  we are developing immunotherapies for prostate cancer  including monoclonal antibodies directed against prostate specific membrane antigen psma  a protein found on the surface of prostate cancer cells 
we are also developing vaccines designed to stimulate an immune response to psma 
our psma programs are conducted with cytogen corporation cytogen collectively  the members through psma development company llc  our joint venture with cytogen psma llc 
we are also studying a cancer vaccine  gmk  in phase clinical trials for the treatment of malignant melanoma 
our sources of revenues through december  have been payments under our former collaboration agreements from psma llc  from research grants and contracts related to our cancer and hiv programs and from interest income 
beginning in january  we will recognize revenues from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for mntx as incurred  for the million upfront payment we received from wyeth over the period of our development obligations and for any milestones or contingent events that are achieved during our collaboration with wyeth 
in addition  the members have not approved a work plan and budget for and  therefore  from january   neither we nor cytogen will recognize revenue from psma llc until such time as a work plan and budget are approved 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 

table of contents a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly as our programs progress and we make filings with regulators for approval to market our product candidates 
our development and commercialization expenses for mntx will be funded by wyeth  which will allow us to devote our current and future resources to our other research and development programs 
we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from three public offerings totaling  shares of our common stock 
we also received an upfront payment of million from wyeth in connection with signing the license and co development agreement 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond one year 
during the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and cash provided by operating activities was million 
other than potential revenues from mntx  we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from product sales or otherwise  in the near term  and we expect our expenses to increase 
consequently  we may require significant additional external funding to continue our operations at their current levels in the future 
such funding may be derived from additional collaboration or licensing agreements with pharmaceutical or other companies or from the sale of our common stock or other securities to investors 
however  such additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals we and wyeth pharmaceuticals wyeth entered into a license and co development agreement  dated december  the collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of mntx 
under the collaboration agreement wyeth paid to us a million non refundable upfront payment 
wyeth is obligated to make up to million in additional payments to us upon the achievement of milestones and contingent events in the development and commercialization of mntx 
all costs for the development of mntx incurred by wyeth or us starting january  are to be paid by wyeth 
we will be reimbursed for our out of pocket development costs by wyeth and will receive reimbursement for our efforts based on the number of our full time equivalent employees ftes devoted to the development project 
wyeth is obligated to pay to us royalties on the sale by wyeth of mntx throughout the world during the applicable royalty periods 
at december   we have deferred the recognition of revenue for the million upfront payment since work under the collaboration agreement did not commence until january the collaboration agreement establishes a joint steering committee jsc and a joint development committee jdc  each with an equal number of representatives of both wyeth and us 
the joint steering committee is responsible for coordinating the key activities of wyeth and us under the collaboration agreement 
the joint development committee is responsible for overseeing  coordinating and expediting the development of mntx by wyeth and us 
the collaboration agreement contemplates the development and commercialization of three products i a subcutaneous form of mntx  to be used in patients with opioid induced constipation  ii an intravenous form of mntx  to be used in patients with post operative bowel dysfunction and iii an oral form of mntx  to be used in patients with opioid induced constipation 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted to wyeth an exclusive  worldwide license  even as to us  to develop and commercialize mntx 
we are responsible for developing the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of mntx in the united states  until they receive regulatory approval 
wyeth is responsible for the development of the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of mntx outside of the united states 
wyeth is responsible for the development of the oral form of mntx  both within the united states and in the rest of the world 
in the event the jsc approves any formulation of mntx other than subcutaneous  intravenous or oral or any other indication for the products currently contemplated using the subcutaneous  intravenous or oral forms of mntx  wyeth will be responsible for development of such products  including conducting clinical trials and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval 
we will remain the owner of all us regulatory filings and approvals relating to the subcutaneous and intravenous forms of mntx 
wyeth will be the owner of all us regulatory filings and approvals related to the oral form of mntx 
wyeth will be the owner of all regulatory filings and approvals outside the united states relating to all forms of mntx 
wyeth is responsible for the commercialization of the subcutaneous  intravenous and oral products throughout the world  will pay all costs of commercialization of all products  including all manufacturing costs  and will retain all proceeds from the sale of the products  subject to the royalties payable by wyeth to us 
decisions with respect to commercialization of any products developed under the collaboration agreement will be made solely by wyeth 
we will transfer to wyeth  at a mutually agreeable time  all existing supply agreements with third parties for mntx and will sublicense any intellectual property rights to permit wyeth to manufacture mntx  during the development and commercialization phases of the collaboration agreement  in both bulk and finished form for all products worldwide 

table of contents we have an option the co promotion option to enter into a co promotion agreement to co promote any of the products developed under the collaboration agreement  subject to certain conditions 
the extent of our co promotion activities and the fees that we will be paid by wyeth for these activities  will be established when we exercise our option 
wyeth will record all sales of products worldwide including those sold by us  if any  under a co promotion agreement 
wyeth may terminate any co promotion agreement if a top pharmaceutical company acquires control of us 
wyeth has agreed to certain limitations on its ability to purchase our equity securities and to solicit proxies 
the collaboration agreement extends  unless terminated earlier  on a country by country and product by product basis  until the last to expire royalty period  as defined  for any product 
progenics may terminate the collaboration agreement at any time upon days of written notice to wyeth days in the case of breach of a payment obligation upon material breach that is not cured 
wyeth may  with or without cause  following the second anniversary of the first commercial sale  as defined  of the first commercial product in the us  terminate the collaboration agreement by providing progenics with at least days prior written notice of such termination 
wyeth may also terminate the agreement i upon days written notice following one or more serious safety or efficacy issues that arise  as defined  and ii at any time  upon days written notice of a material breach that is not cured by progenics 
upon termination of the collaboration agreement  the ownership of the license we granted to wyeth will depend on the party that initiates the termination and the reason for the termination 
purchase of rights from mntx licensors on december   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  progenics pharmaceuticals nevada  inc  collectively  we acquired certain rights for our lead investigational drug  methylnaltrexone mntx  from several of our licensors 
in  we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with ur labs  inc url to develop and commercialize mntx the mntx sub license in exchange for rights to future payments resulting from the mntx sub license 
in  url obtained an exclusive license to mntx  as amended  from the university of chicago uc under an option and license agreement dated may   as amended the url chicago license 
in  url also entered into an agreement with certain heirs of dr 
leon goldberg the goldberg distributees  which provided them with the right to receive payments based upon revenues received by url from the development of the mntx sub license the url goldberg agreement 
on december   we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the purchase agreement by and among progenics pharmaceuticals  inc  progenics pharmaceuticals nevada  inc  ur labs  inc 
and the shareholders of ur labs  inc the url shareholders  under which we acquired substantially all of the assets of url  comprised of its rights under the url chicago license  the mntx sub license and the url goldberg agreement  thus assuming url s rights and responsibilities under those agreements and extinguishing our obligation to make royalty and other payments to url 
on december   we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with the goldberg distributees  under which we assumed all rights and obligations of the goldberg distributees under the url goldberg agreement  thereby extinguishing url s and consequentially  our obligations to make payments to the goldberg distributees 
although we are no longer obligated to make payments to url or the goldberg distributees  we are required to make future payments including royalties to the university of chicago that would have been made by url 
in consideration for the assignment of the goldberg distributees rights and of the acquisition of the assets of url described above  we issued  on december   a total of  shares of our common stock  with a fair value of million  based on a closing price of our common stock of  and paid a total of million in cash representing the opening market value  per share  of  shares of progenics common stock on the date of the acquisition to the url shareholders and the goldberg distributees and paid  in transaction fees 
joint venture with cytogen corporation 
we have a interest in psma llc 
we were required to fund the first million of psma llc s research and development costs 
prior to reaching million of such costs  we recognized reimbursements on a net basis and did not recognize any revenue from psma llc 
during the fourth quarter of  we surpassed the million threshold  at which time we began recognizing revenue for services and costs being provided to and paid by psma llc 
our revenues from psma llc do not result in significant net cash flows to us  since they are relatively minor in comparison to our expenses and  because they are offset in part by capital contributions that we must make to psma llc 

table of contents psma llc s research and development programs and other operations are conducted on its behalf by us  cytogen and third party providers 
we and cytogen are compensated by psma llc for our services provided to psma llc and are reimbursed for costs we pay on its behalf 
from june through january  our services to psma llc were provided pursuant to the terms of a services agreement 
the services agreement  as extended  expired effective january  since then we and cytogen have not agreed upon the terms of a replacement services agreement although both parties have continued to provide services to psma llc and have been compensated for these services 
the members have not currently approved a work plan or budget for and  therefore  beginning on january   we will not recognize revenue from psma llc until such time as a work plan and budget are approved 
the level of future revenues we derive from psma llc will depend on the nature and amount of research and development services requested of us by psma llc as well as the future financial position of psma llc 
our and cytogen s respective levels of commitment to fund psma llc is based on annual budgets and work plans that are developed and approved by the parties 
each annual budget is intended to provide for sufficient funds to conduct the research and development projects specified in the work plan for the then current year 
during june  we and cytogen approved a work plan and a corresponding budget for the year ended december  capital contributions  totaling million  were made by the members during the year ended december   half of which was contributed by each of the members 
contributions totaling million  made in january  were used to fund obligations for work performed under the approved work plan  which amount is included in the total contributions for the periods set forth above 
we have in the past experienced delays in reaching agreement with cytogen regarding budget issues and strategic and operational matters relating to psma llc 
psma llc currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to psma llc 
however  we and cytogen are required to fulfill obligations under existing contractual commitments as of december  although work on the psma projects continues  if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  the programs conducted by psma llc would likely be delayed or halted  and our capital commitments to  and revenues associated with  psma llc would be reduced or eliminated 
we may not reach an agreement with cytogen on these matters 
the work plan and budget for included funding to be made by psma llc in accordance with a collaboration agreement the sgi agreement with seattle genetics  inc sgi  entered into in june under the sgi agreement  sgi provided an exclusive worldwide license to its proprietary antibody drug conjugate technology the adc technology to psma llc 
under the license  psma llc has the right to use the adc technology to link cell killing drugs to psma llc s monoclonal antibodies that target prostate specific membrane antigen 
during the initial research term of the sgi agreement  sgi also is required to provide technical information to psma llc related to implementation of the licensed technology  which period may be extended upon payment of an additional fee 
psma llc may replace prostate specific membrane antigen with another antigen  subject to certain restrictions  upon payment of an antigen replacement fee 
the adc technology is based  in part  on technology licensed by sgi from third parties the licensors 
psma llc is responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of all products under the sgi agreement 
psma llc may sublicense the adc technology to a third party to manufacture the adc s for both research and commercial use 
psma llc made a million technology access payment to sgi  upon execution of the sgi agreement during september  following a capital contribution by the members see above 
the sgi agreement requires psma llc to make maintenance payments during the term of the sgi agreement  payments  aggregating million  upon the achievement of certain defined milestones  and royalties  on a percentage of net sales  as defined  to sgi and its licensors 
in the event that sgi provides materials or services to psma llc under the sgi agreement  sgi will receive supply and or labor cost payments from psma llc at agreed upon rates 
unless terminated earlier  the sgi agreement terminates at the later of a the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of each licensed product in each country or b the latest date of expiration of patents underlying the licensed products 
the ability of psma llc to comply with the terms of the sgi agreement will depend on agreement by the members regarding work plans and budgets of psma llc in future years 
according to the llc agreement that established psma llc  we may directly pursue and obtain government grants directed to the conduct of research utilizing psma related technologies 
in consideration of our initial incremental capital contribution of million of psma llc research expenditures  we may retain million of such government grant funding 
to the extent that we retain grant revenue in respect of work for which we have also been compensated by psma llc  the remainder of the million to be retained by us is reduced and we record an adjustment in our financial statements to reduce both joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
such adjustments were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and million cumulatively through december  
table of contents results of operations amounts in thousands years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and of revenue for research and development services performed for psma llc during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to the slower pace of research and development activities on the psma projects in and an increase in grant revenue recognized by the company from awards related to research and development services performed for psma llc  which effectively decreases contract research and development from joint venture 
proceeds received from grants related to psma llc and for which we have also been compensated by the jv for services provided were in the period and  in the period 
as described above  we have reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements adjustments to decrease both joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture in respect of such amounts 
revenues from research grants and contracts increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in the increase resulted from a greater amount of work performed under the grants in the period  some of which allowed greater spending limits  including million in new grants we were awarded during  million of which will partially fund our pro program over a three and a half year period 
in addition  there was increased activity under the contract awarded to us by the national institutes of health in september the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to  in funding to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a vaccine designed to prevent hiv from infecting individuals exposed to the virus 
our scientists are the principal investigators under the contract and head the vaccine development effort 
the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract are headed by existing academic collaborators of ours 
a total of approximately  is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of  in fees of which had been recognized as revenue as of december  is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
revenues from product sales decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we received fewer orders for research reagents during expenses research and development expenses include scientific labor  supplies  facility costs  clinical trial costs  and product manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses  including license fees  increased  from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in  as follows

also  increases in gmk  due to increased enrollment in the period  and hiv  resulting from an increase in the pro phase and phase b trial activity in the period 
laboratory supplies increases in mntx due to increased costs of manufacturing mntx for clinical trials  hiv due to preparation of materials for the phases and b pro clinical trials and an increase in basic research in and gmk related to manufacturing materials for the ongoing phase clinical trial  partially offset by a decrease in other projects  as research and development activity focused on clinical trials in the areas of mntx and hiv rather than on other areas of basic research 
contract manufacturing and subcontractors increase in mntx and hiv  partially offset by decreases in gmk and other projects 
these expenses are related to the conduct of clinical trials  including testing  analysis  formulation and toxicology services and vary as the timing and level of such services are required 
consultants increases in mntx  and hiv and other projects  partially offset by a decrease in gmk 
these expenses are related to monitoring and conduct of clinical trials  including analysis of data from completed clinical trials and vary as the timing and level of such services are required 
license fees increase primarily related to payments to ur labs and the goldberg distributees see overview purchase of rights from mntx licensors  licensors of mntx  and related to our hiv program 
operating expenses increase primarily due to an increase in rent  utility and facilities expenses  partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses and travel in total a major portion of our spending has been  and we expect will continue to be  associated with mntx  although beginning in  wyeth will fund all of our development activities related to mntx 
spending for our pro program is expected to increase in  while spending for other programs is expected to remain relatively stable or decline 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period  as follows year ended december  category dollar variance percentage variance explanation salaries and benefits increase due to compensation increases  including bonuses 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  average headcount remained stable  although we hired our general counsel in june and one senior executive departed in april consulting and professional fees decrease due primarily to a decrease in recruiting and audit fees  including fees for internal control readiness and the auditing of internal controls over financial reporting  partially offset by increases in consultants and legal and patent fees 
operating expenses decrease in insurance and other operating expenses  partially offset by an increase in rent  utilities and facilities costs 
other increased investor relations and conference costs  partially offset by a decrease in corporate sales and franchise taxes 
total we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during due to an increase in operating expenses related to an increase in headcount 
loss in joint venture decreased from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in during  research and development expenses  including license fees to collaborators of the jv  were higher than in  lower research and development expenses in were more than offset by a million license fee made by psma llc in to seattle genetics  inc see overview above 
however  as further described above  we recognized and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  of payments received from the nih as a reduction to joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
therefore  overall  loss in joint venture was lower in than in depreciation and amortization increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in as we purchased capital assets and made leasehold improvements in to increase our manufacturing capacity 
other income interest income increased from in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in interest income  as reported  is the result of investment income from our marketable securities  offset by the amortization of premiums we paid for those marketable securities

table of contents income taxes for the year ended december   although we had a pre tax net loss of million  we had taxable income due primarily to the million upfront payment received from wyeth and the million cash and common stock paid to ur labs and the goldbergs  which were treated differently for book and tax purposes 
for book purposes  payments made to ur labs and the goldbergs distributees were expensed in the period the payments were made 
however  for tax purposes  the ur labs transaction was a tax free re organization and will never result in a deduction for tax purposes and the payments to the goldberg distrbutees have been capitalized as an intangible license asset and will be deducted for tax purposes over a fifteen year period 
we have  therefore  recognized an income tax provision for the effect of the federal and state alternative minimum tax 
for the year ended december   we had losses both for book and tax purposes

revenues from research grants and contracts increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the corresponding period in the increase resulted from the funding of a greater number of grants in and from increased activity under the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to  in funding to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a vaccine designed to prevent hiv from infecting individuals exposed to the virus 
our scientists are the principal investigators under the contract and head the vaccine development effort 
existing academic collaborators of ours head the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract 
a total of approximately  is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of  in fees of which had been recognized as revenue as of december  is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
based on our currently approved grants  the nih contract and planned grant submissions  we expect revenues from grants and contracts to remain at the current level or increase somewhat over the next five years 
revenues from product sales decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we received fewer orders for research reagents during expenses research and development expenses include scientific labor  supplies  facility costs  clinical trial costs  and product manufacturing costs

these expenses are related to monitoring and conduct of clinical trials  including analysis of data from completed clinical trials and vary as the timing and level of such services are required 
license fees decrease related to lower payments to licensors in our gmk  mntx and other programs 
in addition  there was an increase in our payments related to our hiv program 
operating expenses increase primarily due to increased rent and facility  and other costs in over those in total we expect significant increases in research and development expenses related to mntx as the clinical programs expand and progress 
these expenses would be reduced if we enter into a collaboration for mntx in which the collaborator assumes financial responsibility for some or all of the future development of mntx  or if we choose not to advance all of our mntx programs 
spending in other programs is expected to remain relatively stable

in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  which provided  net of expenses 
net loss our net loss was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  in the corresponding period in liquidity and capital resources we have to date generated no meaningful amounts of recurring revenue  and consequently we have relied principally on external funding to finance our operations 
we have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  public offerings of common stock  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 

table of contents during the year ended december   we completed three public offerings of common stock  pursuant to form s shelf registrations that we had filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in and  which provided us with a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares 
in january  we registered an additional million shares of our common stock  pursuant to the sec s shelf registration process  for future sales 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any further securities transactions 
in addition  we received an upfront payment of million from wyeth in connection with signing the license and co development agreement 
see overview collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with net cash used in operating activities of million for the same period in the increase of million of cash provided by operations resulted primarily from an increase in our net loss of million to million for the year ended december   mostly due to increased research and development activity in  which decreased cash provided by operations and which was partially offset by an increase of million in deferred revenue from the upfront license payment made to us by wyeth  which increased cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations was also increased from to as a result of the following increases in non cash expenses  which partially offset the million increase in our net loss  noted above  related to the purchase of rights from our licensors of mntx in exchange for our common stock see overview purchase of rights from licensors of mntx  and  of non cash amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance to employees of restricted stock during and and from the issuance of compensatory stock options to executive officers and non employees  cash provided by operating activities  period over period  was also increased by  resulting from a decrease in loss in joint venture  as reported after adjustment  of  which was offset by an increase of  due to the adjustment to loss in joint venture 
as described above  we reduce our revenue from the joint venture and our loss in the joint venture by the amount we receive from psma related grant funding up to a cap of million 
the increase of  in loss in joint venture before the adjustment resulted from decreased research and development costs in  which were more than offset by a million license payment that was paid in we account for psma llc by using the equity method and record of psma llc s net loss as our loss in joint venture 
decreased by  due to additional capital contributions to psma llc upon approval of a work plan and a budget by the members  in june  for the year ended december  the work plan and budget required greater capital contributions during than did the corresponding work plan and budget  decreased by  from an increase in trade accounts receivable  mostly for reimbursement of our fourth quarter expenses under our grants and contract with the nih  and increased by  due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as the pace of our research and development activities  especially for mntx  increased in over that in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million for the same period in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of million of marketable securities offset by the purchase of million of marketable securities following the three public offerings of our common stock in we purchase and sell marketable securities in order to provide funding for our operations and to achieve appreciation of our unused cash in a low risk environment 
in addition  we also purchased million of fixed assets including capital equipment and leasehold improvements as we acquired and built out additional manufacturing space 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the same period in the net cash provided by financing activities for includes million in net proceeds that we received from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock during in addition  both periods reflect the exercise of stock options under our stock incentive plans and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
during  we expect that cash received from exercises under such plans will decrease from the amount received during since a major portion of exercises during were of options from a former executive 

table of contents in december  we entered into a license and co development agreement with wyeth for the development and commercialization of mntx see overview collaboration with wyeth pharmaceuticals 
in addition to the upfront payment of million that we received in connection with signing that agreement  wyeth will fund all development and commercialization costs of mntx and will make payments to us when we achieve certain milestone events or when wyeth completes certain contingent activities 
thus  our cash outlays for our development obligations under that agreement will be fully reimbursed by wyeth  allowing us to fund our other research and development projects with our available cash 
in addition  our purchase of rights from our mntx licensors in december see overview purchase of rights from mntx licensors will extinguish our cash payments that would have been due to those licensors in the future upon the achievement of certain events  including sales of mntx products 
we will  however  continue to be responsible to make payments including royalties to the university of chicago upon the occurrence of certain events 
under the terms of our joint venture with cytogen  we are required to make capital contributions to fund of the spending on the psma projects 
our and cytogen s level of commitment to fund psma llc is based on annual budgets that are developed and approved by the parties 
during june  the members approved a work plan and budget for the year ended december  we and cytogen each contributed million during the three months ended march   which was used to fund the obligations outstanding related to work performed in under the approved budget and work plan 
during the remainder of  we and cytogen each made cash payments of million million in the aggregate  for work performed under the approved budget through december  for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of psma llc 
our revenues from psma llc do not result in significant net cash flows to us  since they are relatively minor in comparison to our expenses and because they are offset in part by capital contributions that we are required to make to psma llc 
psma llc currently has no approved budget or work plan because we and cytogen have not yet reached agreement with respect to a number of matters relating to psma llc 
until we reach agreement with cytogen regarding the budget and work plan  we will not know what  if any  commitment we will have to psma llc to fund psma projects 
however  we and cytogen are required to fulfill obligations under existing contractual commitments as of december  although work on the psma projects continues  if we do not reach an agreement regarding the budget and work plan  our capital commitments to  and our revenues associated with  psma llc would be reduced or eliminated 
during june  psma llc entered into a collaboration agreement with sgi see overview  to license certain technology  which required psma llc to make a million technology access fee payment 
the sgi agreement also requires the payment of maintenance fees  payments  aggregating million  upon achievement of defined milestone events and royalties on net sales of any products approved by the fda 
the psma monoclonal antibody research and development project  for which the sgi licensed technology will be used  is currently in the preclinical stage 
therefore  milestone and royalty payments  if any  other than a preclinical milestone payment  which may be due sooner  will not be due for at least three years 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating symptom management and supportive care  hiv related diseases and cancer 
in addition  we are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and cancer 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
we have entered into a collaboration agreement with wyeth with respect to mntx  pursuant to which wyeth has assumed all of the financial responsibility for further development 
as we proceed with our development responsibilities under our mntx programs  although we expect that our spending on mntx will increase significantly during  our cash outlays will be reimbursed by wyeth 
we also expect that spending on our pro hiv program will increase and that spending on our other programs will remain relatively stable in for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred were as follows see results of operations expenses for the year ended december  in millions mntx hiv cancer other programs total 
table of contents in september  we were awarded a contract by the national institutes of health the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to million in funding  subject to annual funding approvals  to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
we anticipate that these funds will be used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
our scientists are the principal investigators under the contract and head the vaccine development effort 
the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract will be headed by existing academic collaborators of ours 
a total of approximately million is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under the nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of million in fees is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including  for the achievement of two milestones 
in july and september  we were awarded a total of two grants from the nih  which provide for up to million and million  respectively  in support for our hepatitis c virus research program and pro hiv development program  respectively  to be awarded over a three year and a three and a half year period  respectively 
funding under those grants is subject to compliance with their terms  and is subject to annual funding approvals 
through december   we recognized  of revenue from those grants 
other than amounts received from wyeth and from currently approved grants and contracts  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than potential revenues from mntx  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our products to the commercial marketing stage 
we anticipate significant increases in expenditures as we continue to expand our research and development activities  particularly in our mntx and pro programs 
consequently  while wyeth will fund our mntx programs  we may require additional funding to continue our other research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our other product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  for the cost of product in licensing and for any possible acquisitions 
our manufacturing and commercialization expenses for mntx will be funded by wyeth 
however  if we exercise our option to co promote mntx products in the us  we will be required to establish and fund a sales force  which we currently do not have 
if we commercialize any other product candidate other than with a corporate collaborator  we would also require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund current operations for at least one year 
our current collaboration with wyeth has provided us with a million upfront payment and will  beginning in january  reimburse our development costs for mntx and provide milestone and other contingent payments upon the achievement of certain events 
wyeth will also fund all commercialization costs of mntx products 
we may also enter into a collaboration agreement with respect to other of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  or how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
the consummation of the agreement with wyeth allows us to allocate our current funds to advance other projects 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for at least one of our product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies in addition to that for mntx  we will be required to fund our operations for periods in the future  by seeking additional financing through future offerings of equity or debt securities or funding from additional grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 

table of contents contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases  licensing and collaboration agreements  a potential funding commitment to psma llc related to its previous contractual obligations and a purchase commitment with our supplier of mntx 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements payments due by december  total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements funding commitment to psma llc purchase commitment total assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table 
the members have not agreed on a work plan or budget for psma llc for however  the members are required to fulfill obligations under existing contractual commitments as of december  for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development of these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and adversely impact our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition during the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue from psma llc for contract research and development  from government research grants and contracts from the national institutes of health the nih  which are used to subsidize certain of our research projects projects  and from the sale of research reagents 
on december   we entered into a license and co development agreement with wyeth  which includes a non refundable upfront license fee  reimbursement of development costs  research and development payments based upon our achievement of clinical development milestones  contingent payments based upon the achievement by wyeth of defined events and royalties on product sales 
we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf issue no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
effective january   we elected to change the method we use to recognize revenue under sab for payments received under research and development collaboration agreements that contain substantive at risk milestone payments 
there was no cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle because we did not have any of these contracts at the time of the change 
the change in accounting method was made because we believe that it will enhance the comparability of our financial results with those of our peer group companies in the biotechnology industry and because it is expected to better reflect the substance of our collaborative arrangements 
under the new method  non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we would recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research or steering committee services  could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents will typically be used as the measure of performance 
under the proportionate performance method  revenue related to upfront license payments is recognized in any period as the percent of actual effort expended in that period relative to total effort budgeted for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis  then the total upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment the substantive milestone method 

table of contents determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
we will recognize revenue for payments that are contingent upon performance solely by our collaborator immediately upon the achievement of the defined event if we have no related performance obligations 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized during the year ended december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   relative to the million upfront license payment received from wyeth  we have recorded million and million as short term and long term deferred revenue  respectively  which is expected to be recognized as revenue through the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s current operating budget for the wyeth collaboration agreement for our total effort required to complete our performance obligations under that arrangement 
that estimate may change in the future and such changes to estimates would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
previously  we had recognized non refundable fees  including payments for services  up front licensing fees and milestone payments  as revenue based on the percentage of efforts incurred to date  estimated total efforts to complete  and total expected contract revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts  with revenue recognized limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
depending on the magnitude and timing of milestone payments  revenue may be recognized sooner under the substantive milestone method than it would have been under the eitf model 
the accounting change did not affect revenue from nih grants and contracts  services performed on behalf of psma llc  or from product sales 
nih grant and contract revenue is recognized as efforts are expended and as related subsidized project costs are incurred 
we perform work under the nih grants and contract on a best effort basis 
the nih reimburses us for costs associated with projects in the fields of hiv and cancer  including preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus  as requested by the nih 
substantive at risk milestone payments are uncommon in these arrangements  but would be recognized as revenue on the same basis as the substantive milestone method 
both we and cytogen are required to fund psma llc equally to support ongoing research and development efforts that we conduct on behalf of psma llc 
we recognize payments for research and development as revenue as services are performed 
the members have not approved a work plan or budget for therefore  beginning on january   we will not be reimbursed by psma llc for our services and we will not recognize revenue from psma llc until such time as a work plan and budget are approved 
for the years ended december   and  our research grant and contract and contract research and development revenue came exclusively from the nih and psma llc  respectively 
our research grant and contract revenue represented  and of our total revenue  respectively  and contract research and development revenue represented  and of our total revenue  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  receivables from the nih represented and of total receivables  respectively  and receivables from psma llc represented and of total receivables  respectively 

table of contents clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
we expect that clinical trial expenses will increase significantly during as clinical trials progress or are initiated in the mntx and hiv programs 
our collaboration agreement with wyeth regarding mntx in which wyeth has assumed all of the financial responsibility for further development will mitigate those costs 
stock based compensation we have historically prepared our financial statements in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in accordance with apb  generally  we have not recognized compensation expense in connection with the awarding of common stock option grants to employees provided that  as of the grant date  all terms associated with the award are fixed and the fair value of our common stock  as of the grant date  is equal to or less than the exercise price 
we recognize compensation expense if the terms of an option grant are not fixed or the quoted market price of our common stock on the grant date is greater than the exercise price 
we also recognize compensation expense for performance based vesting of stock options upon achievement of defined milestones and for restricted stock awards as the restrictions lapse ratably over the related vesting periods 
the fair value of options and warrants granted to non employees for services are included in the financial statements and expensed as they vest 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application 
sfas no 
r requires that we recognize compensation expense for equity based awards to employees in our statements of operations rather than as a disclosure only in the footnotes to our financial statements  as was required under previous accounting principles 
therefore  the assumptions we incorporate in the black scholes option pricing model that we use to value our equity based awards will impact our net loss and net loss per share 
in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have revised certain assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model 
for all awards granted on or after january   we changed the estimate of expected term from years to years 
the period used to calculate historical volatility of our common stock has also been revised to years 
the impact of these revisions is expected to increase the amount of compensation expense we recognize as compared to the amount that would have been recognized using the previous estimates 
we believe that the revised estimates better reflect the exercise activity of stock options granted to our employees 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which is a revision of fasb statement no  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  and purchases of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plans  if compensatory  as defined  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
the standard allows three alternative transition methods for public companies modified prospective method  modified retrospective method with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  and modified retroactive method with restatement of all prior financial statements to include the same amounts that were previously included in pro forma disclosures 
historically  in accordance with sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no  the company had elected to follow the disclosure only provisions of statement no 
and  accordingly  accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued to employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying stock price on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements and pro forma compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
is only disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application and the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of option awards 
we expect the impact that sfas no 
r will have on our results of operations to be material 
total compensation expense related to unvested stock options and restricted stock at january  was million  which will be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents on march   the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provide the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no

we will implement all applicable aspects of sab  including those related to presentation and disclosure requirements under sfas no 
r beginning on january  on august   the fasb staff issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 
r fsp r 
fsp r indefinitely defers the requirement of sfas no 
r  that a freestanding financial instrument issued to an employee  such as a stock option or restricted stock award  originally subject to fas r become subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable gaap when the rights conveyed by the instrument to the holder are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee of the entity  such as upon termination of employment 
our stock incentive plans allow exercise of equity based awards for a period of three months following termination of employment 
we will apply the guidance in fsp r upon initial adoption of sfas no 
r  which will preclude the necessity to record a liability during that three month period 
on october   the fasb staff issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  practical exception to the application of grant date as defined in statement r fsp r 
fsp r provides that the grant date for purposes of accounting for stock based compensation awards under sfas no 
r would be established prior to the communication of the key terms of the award to the recipient if certain conditions are met 
fsp r provides that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award exists at the date the award is approved by the board of directors or other management with relevant authority if the following conditions are met a the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award with the employer ie  the grant is unilateral and b the key terms of the award are expected to be communicated to all of the recipients within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
fsp r provides that a relatively short time period should be determined based on the period during which an entity could plausibly complete the actions necessary to communicate the terms of an award to the recipient s in accordance with the entity s customary human resource practices 
we will apply the guidance of fsp r upon initial adoption of sfas no 
r 
we do not expect any material impact from the adoption of fsp r because it does not represent a change in its practice of granting equity based awards 
on november   the fasb staff issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides a transition election related to the accounting for the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards upon an entity s adoption of sfas no 
r 
the transition election is intended to simplify the calculation of the pool of windfall tax benefits that is available to absorb tax deficiencies  or shortfalls  that may occur in periods subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
determining the pool of windfall tax benefits under sfas no 
r requires an entity to analyze and reconcile the book and tax records of all stock based compensation awards dating back to the original effective date of sfas no 
in the fasb staff issued fsp r because there may be significant cost or complexities involved in determining the pool of windfall tax benefits from the original effective date of sfas no 
fsp r gives entities an election to select an alternative transition method the short cut method for the calculation of the pool of windfall tax benefits as of the adoption date of sfas no 
r 
we have elected to adopt the short cut method when we adopt sfas no 
r and we expect our pool of windfall tax benefits to be zero on the adoption date because we have had net operating losses since inception 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event fsp r 
fsp r amends sfas r to allow options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation to be accounted for as equity instruments rather than as liabilities  as had been required by sfas r if the option contains a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employee s control until it becomes probable that the event will occur 
an example of such contingent event is a change in control of an employer 
the company does not expect fsp r to have a material effect on its financial statements 

table of contents on september   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  nonfinancial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb  such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the impact of adoption of sfas no 
to be material to our financial statements 
on november   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas and fas 
this fsp  effective january   provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and equity securities should be considered other than temporary  as well as the subsequent accounting for these investments 
the adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing our risk 
our investments consist of taxable auction securities  corporate notes and issues of government sponsored entities 
our investments totaled million at december  approximately million of these investments had fixed interest rates  and million had interest rates that were variable 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our fixed interest rate long term investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the investment 
a basis point increase in the december  market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in the market values of these investments 
at december   the company did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments
