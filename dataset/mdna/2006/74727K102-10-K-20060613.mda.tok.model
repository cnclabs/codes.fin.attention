item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of a broad line of specialty tools and flooring related products  marketing over  specialty tools and related products used primarily for surface preparation and installation of ceramic tile  carpet  vinyl and wood flooring 
the company s products are sold to home improvement retailers  specialty distributors to the hardware  construction  flooring and home improvement trades  chain or independent hardware  tile and carpet retailers for use by the do it yourself consumer as well as the construction or remodeling professional  and original equipment manufacturers 
the company has executed a growth strategy intended to improve overall performance and profitability of operations that included acquisitions  the reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations and the enhancement of cross selling of product among the company s channels of distribution 
although the company has realized certain benefits from its growth strategy  the company s rapid growth and challenges relating to the company s overseas operations and integration of acquired business has had certain negative effects on the company s financial performance 
the company experienced a increase in net sales in fiscal in comparison to the previous fiscal year  which management attributes primarily to the growth in sales of flooring adhesives products  a portion of which results from the acquisitions made during the period 
in addition  further penetration of the company s existing product offerings across more home center locations and distribution customers  and sales resulting from acquisitions other than acquired flooring adhesives operations also contributed to the increase 
the company s gross profit as a percent of revenue fell from in fiscal to in fiscal and was negatively impacted by several factors in fiscal the company experienced raw material cost increases throughout fiscal primarily for petroleum based raw materials used in adhesives and aluminum and copper used in other flooring tools 
in addition  the increase in petroleum products is reflected in the freight cost the company incurs in distributing its products 
only a portion of these cost increases were able to be passed on to the company s customers 
in addition  the sales of adhesives products continued to increase as a percent of total sales during fiscal adhesives products are generally lower margin than the flooring tools and other products offered by the company 
as adhesives become a larger portion of total sales  there is a negative effect on gross margin as a percentage of sales 
gross margin was also affected by an increase in the level of sales and rebates issued to home center customers in fiscal as a regular practice  customers in the home center distribution channel are issued rebates from each vendor  the magnitude of which depends of the particular level of business activity 
although increased sales to the company s home center customers in fiscal resulted in an increase in gross margin over the fiscal period  the company also experienced an increase in the level of rebates associated with these sales which had a negative impact on gross margin as a percentage of sales 
net loss for the year was million  or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal the factors affecting gross margin described above contributed to the reduction in net income in comparison to the fiscal period 
in addition  the net loss for fiscal includes a charge of million related to an increase in the value of a warrant put liability outstanding at the end of the year 
during april  as part of a financing arrangement entered into at the time  the company issued million year warrants that can be put to the company at any time after april  based on criteria set forth in the warrant agreement 
the company estimates the value of the associated liability according to the terms of the warrant and warrant agreement 
as of february   an appraised value of the company was used to calculate the value of the warrants  resulting in a million liability which is recorded in current liabilities 
as of february  based on management estimates  the company recorded a million liability in long term liabilities 
changes to the fair value of the warrant put liability are recognized in the earnings of the company  and in fiscal  the company recognized expense of million 
the put warrants will continue to be periodically revalued as long as they remain outstanding which could result in either significant increases or reductions in net income depending on the circumstances of the valuation 

table of contents the company s results of operations during fiscal were also impacted by several operational events that the company expects will improve financial performance in future periods 
on may   the company acquired the assets of capitol usa adhesives in exchange for cash  a promissory note and all of the assets of the company s carpet seaming tape business 
after the acquisition of capitol  the company closed its boca raton  florida office and warehouse facility and moved the warehousing and distribution operations to dalton  georgia and relocated the corporate offices within boca raton  florida to a smaller facility 
in addition  during fiscal  the company moved other operations to the dalton location and is considering consolidating other functions where appropriate 
in response to the company s high cost of operations in europe in the past  the company also restructured its european manufacturing and distribution function in fiscal by significantly reducing its operations in holland 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in fiscal related to this restructuring 
in addition  the company recorded a million gain resulting from the sale of a carpet seaming tape distribution business 
the sale was executed in conjunction with the acquisition of a flooring adhesive business in fiscal accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are contained in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the following are our most critical accounting policies which are those that require complex judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
the company provides for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns based on historical experience  when the related revenues are recognized 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs including volume based incentives 
inventories the company records inventory at the lower of standard cost or market 
the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on market conditions and expected future demand 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable are principally due from home centers or flooring accessory distributors 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition  and collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due at various times based on each customer s credit worthiness and selling arrangement 
the outstanding balances are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the customer s previous loss history  the customer s ability to pay its obligations and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
impairment evaluations the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company performs indefinite lived impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
when the company determines 
table of contents that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of certain indicators  the assets are assessed for impairment based on the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  impairment assessments are generally determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows of the asset s reporting unit using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in both instances  if the carrying amount of the asset being tested exceeds its fair value  an impairment of the value has occurred and the asset may be written down 
the company s annual impairment assessment date is august st 
income taxes the company is required to estimate income tax in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure and deferred income taxes to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts each year end 
the company must then consider the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes that recoverability is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance

sales at the company s north american subsidiaries increased approximately million and sales at the company s foreign subsidiaries increased approximately million 
approximately million of the increase in sales in north america was the result of increases in sales to existing customers

the remaining increase is due to expansion of the company s distribution customer base and the effect of the acquisition of various product lines  net of divestitures 
sales of adhesives products  which increased approximately million  accounted for substantially all of the increase in north american distribution sales and a portion of the increase in north american home center sales 
the increase in sales at the company s foreign subsidiaries is primarily the result of the inclusion of full year results of the company s acquisitions in france and mexico which were made during the third quarter of fiscal approximately million along with the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes approximately million

gross profit for fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately million or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in the fiscal period from in the fiscal period 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales primarily resulted from cost increases in the raw material components of the company s adhesive business  and to a lesser extent finished goods  that were only partially passed through to the company s home center and distributor customer base during the fiscal period  the relative increase in flooring adhesive product sales which have relatively lower overall margin than do sales of other types of products  increased sales rebates associated with increased sales volume from the company s largest customers and the initiation of a direct shipment program direct from our 
table of contents suppliers to some of our customers with delivery being taken at the supplier s dock with lower gross profit margins 
the direct shipment program  however  is expected to generate greater overall operating profit margins after reductions in related operating expenses 
the full year effect of acquisitions made in fiscal accounted for approximately million of additional costs and foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately million of the cost increases 
shipping expenses for the fiscal period were approximately million compared to approximately million for the fiscal period  an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in shipping expenses is primarily due to the increased level of business activity in north america

the increase is primarily due to the recording  in fiscal  of a tax benefit associated with the write off of certain debt owed to the company s north american operations from one of the company s international subsidiaries 
this was partially offset by the recording  in fiscal  of a valuation allowance against previously recorded tax benefits from foreign net operating losses 
in addition  the company does not 
table of contents realize a tax benefit associated with the accounting for the warrant put liability 
the valuation allowances and the non deductibility of the change in the warrant put liability were the primary reasons for the recording of a tax provision in the current year despite a pretax loss 
estimated tax rates are based upon the most recent effective tax rates available in every jurisdiction in which the company operates 
the company expects that its future effective tax rate will be somewhat lower than its statutory rate in the near term due to loss carry forwards that can be utilized in the future 
due to the reasons stated above the company recorded a net loss of approximately million or per diluted share in the fiscal period compared to an income of million or per diluted share in the fiscal period 
fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales for the twelve months ended february  were approximately million compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended february  fiscal  or the fiscal period  an increase of approximately million or

any cash in excess of anticipated requirements is invested in commercial paper or overnight repurchase agreements with a financial institution 
the company states the value of such investments at market price and classifies them as cash equivalents on its balance sheet

table of contents finance anticipated capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that the assumptions upon which the company bases its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements and the assumptions upon which it bases its belief that funds will be available to satisfy such requirements will prove to be correct 
if these assumptions are not correct  the company may be required to raise additional capital through loans or the issuance of debt securities that would require the consent of the company s current lenders  or through the issuance of equity securities 
to the extent the company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity  ownership dilution to existing stockholders will result  and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
moreover  additional capital may be unavailable to the company on acceptable terms  or may not be available at all
