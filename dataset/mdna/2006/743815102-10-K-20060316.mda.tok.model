item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
cpsa monitors our service encounter value based upon data submitted by us electronically 
if our service encounter value exceeds amounts paid to us under this contract equal to one twelfth of the annual contract amount on a monthly basis  we recognize revenue equal to the amount that yields a ratio of the service encounter value to revenue of 
for the first six months of this contract july  to december   the amount of revenue we recognized in excess of amounts paid to us year to date amounted to approximately million 
while we believe the additional revenue over the contractual amount is collectible based on cpsa s history of making additional payments to us  collection is subject to cpsa s discretion and dependent upon sufficient funds allocated by the state of arizona 
if cpsa does not pay us for our service encounter value in excess of the contractual amount  the impact of not receiving such payment could have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
if our encounter value is not sufficient to support year to date payments made to us or if we fail to provide data sufficient to permit accurate monitoring of our service encounter value  cpsa can suspend payments to us 
cpsa has not suspended payments to us nor have we returned any amounts to the payer 
while we do not anticipate that we will be required to return any amounts to cpsa  and while we believe that our service encounter value is sufficient to support all amounts paid to us under the contract  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
if we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts  we may incur losses on these contracts 
under our fee for service contracts  we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients 
to earn a profit on these contracts  we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services 
our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs  such as rent and 
table of contents other overhead 
our fee for service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore  if we fail to estimate our costs accurately  we may incur losses on these contracts 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from cost based service contracts for which we record revenue at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies  which puts us at risk that we may be required to subsequently refund a portion of our recorded revenues for such contracts 
with our acquisition of choices group  inc  aspen mso  llc and college community services in july  we acquired certain cost based service contracts that require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or an insufficient number of encounters 
for the year ended december   revenues from these contracts represented approximately of our total revenues for the period 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under the contracts  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our results of operations will fluctuate due to seasonality 
our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons 
historically  these seasonal variations have had a nominal affect on our operating results and operating cash flows 
as we have grown our home and community based services business our exposure to seasonal variations has grown and will continue to grow  particularly with respect to our school based services  educational services and tutoring services with the acquisition of children s behavioral health  inc and a to z in home tutoring  llc 
we experience lower home and community based services revenue when school is not in session 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our home and community based services 
in addition  as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response to our entry by other social services providers 
as a result of these factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future performance 
further  it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below the expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company 
in that event  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
while we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals  we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future  and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable 
we obtain  and will continue to seek to obtain  a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities 
to obtain business from government entities  we are often required to respond to requests for proposals  or rfps 
to propose effectively  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors 
we must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables 
our ability to respond successfully to rfps will greatly impact our business 
we may not be awarded contracts through the rfp process  and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies  we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government sponsored contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
to facilitate our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development 
table of contents of an rfp or program for privatization of social services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers 
the effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions 
we also may lose key personnel who have these relationships 
we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees 
any failure to establish  maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts 
the federal government may refuse to grant consents and or waivers necessary to permit for profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs 
under current law  in order to privatize certain functions of government programs the federal government must grant a consent and or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency 
if the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraw approval of any granted waiver  the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for profit entity  such as us  to provide the service 
failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents and or waivers could adversely affect our continued business and future growth 
our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of social services 
the market for our services depends largely on federal  state and local legislative programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time 
moreover  part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal  state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of social services 
however  there are opponents to the privatization of social services and  as a result  future privatization of social services is uncertain 
if additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted  or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged  repealed or invalidated  our growth could be adversely impacted 
our strategic relationships with certain not for profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks 
since some government agencies prefer or require contracts for privatized social services to be administered through not for profit organizations  we rely heavily on our relationships with not for profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies 
we currently maintain strategic relationships with not for profit social services organizations with which we have management contracts  of which are tax exempt organizations 
federal tax laws require that the boards of directors of not for profit tax exempt organizations be independent 
although currently the boards of directors of the tax exempt not for profit organizations for which we provide management services are independent  prior to july  our employees constituted a majority of the boards of three of these organizations 
if  as a result of such past practices  we and or these managed entities were ever found to be in violation of these federal tax laws  we and they could be subject to penalties and  as described below  the tax exempt status of these managed entities could be jeopardized 
federal tax laws also require that the management fees we charge the not for profit entities we manage be at fair market rates 
prior to july  however  these management contracts contained a provision that permitted us to earn bonuses to our management fee dependent upon the managed entity s operating results 
in connection with our renegotiation of our fee arrangement with these entities  we amended these agreements as of july   at which time we removed the bonus provision 
if the internal revenue service  referred to as the irs  determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us  and further determined that we were  at the time those rates were set  in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the tax exempt organization through our past majority positions on the board of directors or otherwise  the irs could sanction us and the tax exempt organization  including levying a penalty against us of of the amount paid in excess of the market rates for the services provided and the return of all excess benefit amounts  plus interest  to the tax exempt organization 
if the excess benefit amount were not returned  an additional penalty equal to of the excess benefit could be imposed on us 
generally  under state law  not for profit entities may pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered 
if the compensation paid to us by these not for profit entities is deemed unreasonable  then the state could take action against the not for profit entity which could adversely effect us 

table of contents in addition  until september  three of these not for profit organizations were co borrowers on our credit facility and their receivables were pledged as additional collateral under the facility 
as the manager of these entities  we drew down on the line of credit under our credit facility on their behalf and advanced the borrowings to them for their operating expenses 
in september  these entities were removed as co borrowers under our credit facility  and their assets were removed as collateral from our line of credit 
as a result of our relationships with these tax exempt organizations  including our employees past majority positions on the boards of directors of some of them  the terms of our management contracts with these organizations and or the shared borrowing relationship we previously had with some of them  the irs could propose to revoke the tax exempt status of some or all of these tax exempt organizations 
if the irs were successful in revoking the tax exempt status of any of these tax exempt organizations  such organization would likely be treated as a taxable entity from the time of the event or events that caused the exempt status to be revoked 
in addition  state authorities could investigate and take action against the not for profit status of these organizations for similar reasons 
a state attorney general could also take action to dissolve a state not for profit organization that could result in our loss of the organization s contract s for services 
the loss of federal tax exempt and or not for profit status would adversely affect the ability of these organizations to be exempt from certain federal taxes and could have the same impact on state taxes 
the imposition of federal and or state taxes on such organizations could reduce the funds available to pay our management fees 
further  these organizations existing payers may terminate or fail to renew or extend their contracts with the tax exempt organizations if irs or state controversies of this type were threatened or were to occur 
the loss of such contracts could have a negative effect on our earnings 
government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us  which could limit our market opportunities 
our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees 
many government employees  however  belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks 
these unions could apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs 
union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts 
the media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients 
this media coverage  if negative  could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts 
we may incur costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner 
moreover  any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner 
our business is subject to risks of litigation 
we are in the human services business and therefore are subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and or care for a client 
we carry professional liability and general liability insurance and have an umbrella liability insurance policy  which provide us with aggregate coverage 
table of contents limits of million per occurrence and an annual combined policy aggregate limit of million 
a substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flow and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance 
we can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct in addition to professional liability type claims by an employee  including but not limited to  claims arising out of accidents involving employees driving to or from interactions with clients or assault and battery 
we can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment law 
while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
furthermore  we can be subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not for profit entities we manage 
in the event of a claim and depending on  among other things  the circumstances  allegations  and size of the management contract  we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our use of a self insurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured event 
in may  we adopted a program of self insurance with regard to a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities managed by us under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
in the event that our actual reinsured losses and the reinsured losses of the certain designated entities managed by us increase unexpectedly or exceed our estimated reinsured losses under the program  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in costs  we will continue to evaluate the levels of claims we include in our self insurance program 
any increases to this program increase our risk exposure and therefore increase the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
we could be subject to significant state regulation and potential sanctions if our health care benefits program is deemed to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement 
for the purpose of managing and providing employee healthcare benefits we deem ourselves to be a single employer under section of erisa with regard to our own employees as well as the employees of certain of our managed entities covered by our healthcare benefit program 
the department of labor  or dol  or individual states could disagree with our interpretation and consider our program to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement  or mewa  and  as such  subject to regulation by state insurance commissions 
if involuntarily deemed a mewa  our cost to manage the state by state regulatory environment for the self funded portion of our health insurance program would be prohibitive and we could  as a result  elect to maintain our self funded health insurance plan only for our owned entities  forcing the three managed entities currently included in our self funded plan to negotiate and purchase their own health benefits 
in addition  if our health care benefits program is determined to be a mewa  civil and or criminal sanctions are possible 
we face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced social service professionals  and we may be unable to grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced social service professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients 
our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is strongly considered when we evaluate education  experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff 
to that end  we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelors degree  masters degree or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social service providers and administrators 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource 
table of contents for the foreseeable future 
we must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us 
contract provisions and client needs determine the number  education and experience levels of social service professionals we hire 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract 
our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to offer competitive wages  benefits and professional growth opportunities 
some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
the inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
since  our business has grown significantly in size and complexity 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
in addition  we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
the nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that we will continue making strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have made a number of acquisitions since our inception  including eleven since our initial public offering in august the success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations 
there can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the same historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions  that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies contracts  that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services  expand our markets or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with some acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership and or we could incur or assume substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following problems assimilating the purchased operations  unanticipated costs and legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition  failure to maintain and renew contracts  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition  and dilution to our earnings per share 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition  and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

table of contents our future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition 
we may incur debt in the future in connection with our acquisition strategy and for other corporate opportunities 
if we do so  these debt obligations could pose risk by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate requirements  impeding us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  and making us more vulnerable if a downturn in our business occurs and limiting our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business 
if we were to fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in these agreements  we would be in default 
a default could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and marketability of our common stock 
our lenders would have the ability to require that we immediately pay all outstanding indebtedness 
if the lenders were to require immediate payment  we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility  our subordinated notes or our other indebtedness 
in such event  we could be forced to seek protection under bankruptcy laws  which could have a material adverse effect on our existing contracts and our ability to procure new contracts as well as our ability to recruit and or retain employees 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
we compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
most of our competition consists of local social service organizations that compete with us for local contracts  such as united way supported agencies and faith based agencies such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
other competitors include local  not for profit organizations and community based organizations 
historically  these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities 
we also compete with larger companies  such as maximus  inc  whose government operations group administers and manages welfare program services  childcare support enforcement  medicaid enrollment and other consulting services for state and local governments 
national mentor  inc is the country s largest provider of foster care services and competes with us in existing markets for foster care services 
in addition  many institutional providers offer some type of community based care including such organizations as cornell companies  inc  res care  inc  psychiatric solutions  inc and the devereaux foundation 
some of these companies have greater financial  technical  political  marketing  name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients and or payers than we do 
in addition  some of these companies offer more services than we do 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition from new entrants into our markets 
increased competition may result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 
our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions  including regulatory provisions governing surveys  audits  anti kickbacks  self referrals  false claims and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  and changes to or violations of these regulations could negatively impact our revenues 
in many of the locations where we operate  we are required by state law to obtain and maintain licenses 
the applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide  the credentials of staff  record keeping  treatment planning  client monitoring and supervision of staff 
the failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing 
table of contents services to clients in a given jurisdiction 
most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers 
we are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations 
such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers 
in addition  we are or may be subject to anti kickback  self referral and false claim laws 
violations of these laws may result in significant penalties  including repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of such laws  criminal fines  civil money penalties  damages  imprisonment  a ban from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and or bans from obtaining government contracts 
such fines and other penalties could negatively impact our business by decreasing profits due to repayment of overpayments or from the imposition of fines and damages  damaging our reputation and diverting our management resources 
due to our access  use or disclosure of health information relating to individuals  we are subject to the privacy mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
hipaa mandates  among other things  the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the nation s healthcare system 
hipaa requires the dhhs to adopt standards for electronic transactions and code sets for basic healthcare transactions such as payment  eligibility and remittance advices  or transaction standards  privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy standards  security of individually identifiable health information  or security standards  electronic signatures  as well as unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals and enforcement 
final regulations have been issued by dhhs for the privacy standards  certain of the transaction standards and security standards 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply in our operations with these standards and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 
in addition  in connection with providing services to customers that also are healthcare providers  we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers that we will provide those services in accordance with the privacy standards and security standards 
hipaa has and will require significant and costly changes for our company and others in the healthcare industry 
compliance with the privacy standards became mandatory in april  compliance with the transaction standards became mandatory in october although full implementation was delayed with respect to the medicare program until october  and compliance with the security standards became mandatory in april in february  dhhs published its final rule on enforcement of the hipaa administrative simplification provisions  including the transaction standards  the security standards and the privacy rule 
this enforcement rule addresses  among other issues  dhhs s policies for determining violations and calculating civil money penalties  how dhhs will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil money penalties  and various procedural issues 
we have appointed an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with hipaa 
this committee is responsible for training our employees  including our regional and local managers and staff  to comply with hipaa and monitoring compliance with the policy 
however  like other businesses subject to hipaa regulations  we cannot fully predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on us 
the costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial  which could negatively impact our profitability 
provisions in our corporate documents and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware general corporation law  may hinder a change of control 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us  even though such proposals may be beneficial to you 
these provisions include a classified board of directors that cannot be replaced without cause by a majority vote of our stockholders  
table of contents our board of director s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock  on terms as the board of directors may determine  without stockholder approval  and provisions of delaware general corporation law that restrict many business combinations 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date it acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained

overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage 
as a result of  and in response to  the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have increased our capacity to provide services in previously underserved geographic areas through the development of new programs and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
as of december   we provided services directly and through the entities we manage to approximately  clients from locations in states and the district of columbia 
our goal is to be the provider of choice to the social services industry 
focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit managed services  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality of service to our clients and provide a viable alternative to state and local governments current service delivery systems 
our industry is highly fragmented  competitive and dependent upon government funding 
we depend on our experience  financial strength and broad presence to compete vigorously in each service offering 
challenges for us include competing with local incumbent social services providers in some of the areas we seek to enter and in rural areas where significant growth opportunities exist  finding and retaining qualified employees 
we seek strategic acquisitions as one way to enter competitive markets 
our business is highly dependent upon our obtaining contracts with government sponsored entities 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses such as leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel before we receive any contract payments  and  under some of the large contracts we are awarded  we are required to invest significant sums of money before receiving any contract payments 
we are also required to recruit and hire qualified staff to perform the services under contract 
we 
table of contents strive to control these start up costs by leveraging our existing infrastructure to maximize our resources and manage our growth effectively 
however  with each contract we are awarded  we face the challenge of quickly and effectively building a client base to generate revenue to recover these costs 
effective may   we began reinsuring a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we manage under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
in addition  effective july   we began self funding a substantial portion of our employee health insurance program which we also offer to employees of certain entities we manage 
these decisions were made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations and fluctuating insurance premium rates 
on december   our board of directors  or board  upon recommendation of the compensation committee of the board  approved the acceleration of the vesting dates of all unvested stock options previously awarded to eligible employees  directors and consultants  including stock options granted to executive officers and non employee directors  under our stock option plan  effective december  for all of our active employees  directors and consultants at december  all other terms of the stock options previously awarded remained the same 
the purpose of accelerating the vesting of outstanding unvested options is to enable us to avoid recognizing stock based compensation expense associated with these options in future periods after the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  in january see note  entitled  stock option and incentive plans  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information regarding the acceleration of the vesting dates of all unvested stock options 
additional information regarding the follow on offering of our common stock is included in the liquidity and capital resources discussion below 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations 
in addition  effective june   we amended our loan and security agreement with cit healthcare llc  or cit formerly known as healthcare business credit corporation  to provide for a million revolving line of credit and a million acquisition term loan 
borrowings from our credit facilities with cit provide funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
how we earn our revenue our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of our managed entities 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
in addition  from time to time  we provide short term consulting services to other social services organizations for which we receive consulting fees that are a fixed amount per contract 
any such consulting revenues are presented in our consolidated statement of operations as management fees 

table of contents how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally  through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or our managed entities are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions is generally accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage in expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees as that is our most important variable cost and the key to the management of our operating margins 
acquisitions since december   we have completed the following acquisitions on june   we acquired all of the equity interest in children s behavioral health  inc  or cbh  a pennsylvania provider of home and school based social services for children

the cash portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions was partially funded from our credit facility with cit 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities and have developed a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  our management agreement relationships and loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue generally at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be probable 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
fee for service contracts 
revenues related to services provided under fee for service contracts are recognized as revenue at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and cost based service contracts 
revenues from our cost based service contracts are generally recorded at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after june  which is the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and annual block purchase contract 
effective july   our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 

table of contents we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if at any time the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 
for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract 
the remaining of revenue recognized each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract corresponding to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value plus the administrative component and defer revenue for any excess amounts received such that the ratio of service encounter value to revenue recognized equals 
if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue equal to the amount that yields a ratio of the service encounter value to revenue of  and only if collection of any additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be probable 
as of december   the amount of revenue recognized from this contract in excess of the contract amount for the first six months of the contract term was approximately million 
cpsa has a history of making additional payments to us beyond the stated contractual amounts 
in addition  cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any payments and we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract and for the year ended december  and represented and of our total revenues  respectively 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and we recognize management fee revenues from our management agreements as such amounts are earned  as defined by the respective management agreement  and collection of such amount is considered probable 
we assess the likelihood of whether any of our management fee revenues may need to be returned to help our managed entities fund their working capital needs 
if the likelihood is other than remote  we defer the recognition of all or a portion of the management fees received 
to the extent we defer management fees as a means of funding any of our managed entities losses from operations  such amounts are not recognized as management fee revenues until they are ultimately collected from the operating income of the managed entities 
in addition  as part of our reinsurance program  we reinsure a substantial portion of the general and professional liability and workers compensation cost of certain designated entities we manage through spcic 
further  we offer health insurance coverage to employees of certain entities we manage under our self funded health insurance program 
in exchange for this liability coverage  we receive a reimbursement equal to the pro rata share of certain of our managed entities costs to participate in our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs 
we consider these arrangements to be among the array of management services we provide 
table of contents to certain of our managed entities 
as a result  we record amounts received from these managed entities as management fees revenue 
revenues related to these arrangements totaled approximately million for the year ended december   and represented less than of our revenue for the same period 
consulting agreements 
from time to time we may enter into consulting agreements with other entities that provide government sponsored social services 
under the agreements  we evaluate and make recommendations with respect to their management  administrative and operational services 
we may continue to enter into consulting agreements in the future 
in exchange for these consulting services  we receive a fixed fee that is either payable upon completion of the services or on a monthly basis 
these consulting agreements are generally short term in nature and are subject to termination by either party at any time  for any reason  upon advance written notice 
revenues related to these services are recognized at the time such consulting services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
fees earned pursuant to our consulting agreements are classified as management fees revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and represented less than of our revenue for the years ended december  and the costs associated with generating our management fee and consulting fee revenues are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
we determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific identification of individual accounts and review of aging trends 
any account receivable older than days is generally deemed uncollectible and written off or fully reserved for 
we consider payer correspondence and payer assurances when evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
amounts where collection is considered to be probable are deemed to be collectible 
if the financial condition of our payers were to deteriorate  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer billing system delays  delays related to our integration of new acquisitions and certain supplemental payments related to our annual block purchase contract in arizona 
unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded in excess of amounts formally invoiced 
unbilled amounts are expected to be collected within one year 
our write off experience for the years ended december  and was less than of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year and between annual valuations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when determining whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
we use valuation techniques consistent with a market approach by deriving a multiple of our ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based on the market value of our common stock at year end and then applying this multiple to each reporting unit s ebitda for the year to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss is measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of 
table of contents the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed as of december  resulted in no impairment losses 
when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocated a portion of the purchase consideration to certain management contracts and customer relationships based on the expected direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on discounted cash flow basis over the useful life of the assets 
we assess whether certain relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes 
we determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
under certain conditions we may assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with business development  administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly or indirectly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 
our management agreements with these not for profit organizations generally require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies such as employee enrichment programs  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
the accounting for our relationships with these organizations is based on a number of judgments regarding certain facts related to the control of these organizations and the terms of our management agreements 
any significant changes in the facts upon which these judgments are based could have a significant impact on our accounting for these relationships 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of emerging issues task force  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with consolidated management agreements  or the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  
table of contents consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  or interpretation no 
r  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of interpretation no 
r  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we maintain reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage and our self funded health insurance program provided to our employees and employees of certain entities we manage 
as of december   we had reserves of approximately million for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs and approximately  in reserve for our self funded health insurance program which began july  we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to our general and professional liability coverage and our judgment based on our past experience and industry experience to support the required liability and related expense associated with our workers compensation coverage and health insurance coverage 
with respect to our self funded health insurance program  we also consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense 
we record a provision for losses incurred but not reported  based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and management s judgment using its past experience and industry experience 
we record claims expense by plan year based on the lesser of the aggregate stop loss if applicable or the developed losses as calculated by independent actuaries with respect to our general and professional liability coverage and our past experience and industry experience with respect to our workers compensation coverage and health insurance coverage 
we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs and believe these reserves to be adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

the acquisition of pottsville behavioral counseling group  or pottsville  in april and equity interests in three entities  collectively referred to as the aspen companies  comprising of choices group  inc  aspen mso  llc now known as providence community services  llc and college community services  in july contributed approximately million in home and community based services revenue for as compared to as the operations of these acquisitions were included only from the date of acquisition 
in addition  we acquired cbh in june  maple star nevada in august  alphacare in september and drawbridges in october which added  on a cumulative basis  approximately million to our home and community based services revenue for further  services in the district of columbia which began in june yielded additional home and community based services revenue of approximately million for as compared to the prior year because the operations in the district of 
table of contents columbia were included for only the last six months of also  we recognized approximately million of home and community based services revenue in excess of the contractual amount under our annual block purchase contract with cpsa for approximately million of the total amount recognized as home and community based services revenue under this contract in excess of the contract amount has been collected through supplemental payments 
the supplemental payments received from cpsa are in addition to the annual contract amounts we were entitled to receive under our annual block purchase contract for services rendered and are at the discretion of cpsa 
due to the discretionary nature of the supplemental payments and despite the fact that we have been awarded such payments historically under our annual block purchase contract  historical supplemental payments are not necessarily indicative of future supplemental payments that we may receive 
excluding the acquisitions completed in and  start up services in the district of columbia in and the home and community based services revenue recognized in excess of the contractual amount under our contract with cpsa in  our home and community based services provided additional revenue of approximately million for  as compared to due to client volume increases in new and existing locations 
due to the nature of government funded social services  rates paid for social services provided generally do not fluctuate substantially from year to year 
thus  fluctuations in rates for our home and community based services have a nominal affect on our home and community based services revenue 
foster care services 
in our traditional home and community based markets such as arizona and virginia and in delaware  where we are expanding our foster care services  our cross selling efforts yielded an additional million of foster care services revenue for as compared to we expect cross selling activities to continue and provide additional revenues in the future as we focus on continuous expansion of our foster care services 
the acquisition of maple star nevada resulted in an increase in foster care services revenue of approximately million from period to period 
partially offsetting the increase in foster care services revenue in were decreases in our tennessee and nebraska markets where we have experienced a decrease in the number of clients placed in foster homes due to systemic changes at the state level and lower inventory of licensed foster homes 
in tennessee certain changes at the state level have led to a shorter length of stay per client and a lower number of clients eligible to receive care which resulted in a decrease in foster care services revenue of approximately  for as compared to in nebraska the inventory of licensed foster homes has declined leading to a decrease in the number of clients placed in foster homes and a decrease in foster care services revenue of approximately  for as compared to we are exploring opportunities to permanently place foster care clients through adoption programs in tennessee which we expect will mitigate the decline in foster care clients and the decrease in foster care services revenue 
in addition  we are increasing our efforts to recruit additional homes in nebraska which we expect will increase our foster care service offering 
further offsetting the increase in foster care services revenue in was a decrease in our florida market where a number of our foster care clients have transitioned from a higher level of foster care services to a lower level of foster care services for which we receive a lower rate 
these lower rates led to a decrease of approximately  in funds from the contracting payers to provide foster care services for as compared to management fees 
revenue for entities we manage but do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes managed entity revenue increased to million for as compared to million for the combined effects of business growth and the acquisition of the management agreements with care development of maine  or cdom  fcp  inc  or fcp  the redco group  or redco  maple star colorado  inc and maple star oregon  inc 
yielded approximately million in additional management fees revenue for as compared to  net of a decrease in management fees revenue from our amended management services agreement with rio grande behavioral health services  inc  or rio grande  described below 
in addition  we entered into several short term consulting agreements in which added another million to management fees revenue for revenues from consulting fees are not indicative of future revenues from consulting services that we may provide in the future 
further  we earned an additional million for under our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs in which certain of the entities we manage participate 
no such amounts were recorded in as our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs did not exist until on june   rio grande  received a notice canceling one of its provider health maintenance organization network contracts effective july  subsequently  rio grande commenced negotiations for a 
table of contents new contract 
rio grande and the payer agreed to continue their relationship under new terms 
in connection with this agreement  we amended the management services agreement between us and rio grande to change the management fee charged to rio grande for certain management services from a per member per month based fee to a fixed fee per month 
the fixed fee was comparable to the previous per member per month based fee and remained at this predetermined level until january   at which time the fixed fee was reduced 
the new fixed fee had the effect of decreasing our management fees revenue from this management services agreement by approximately  for when compared to partially offsetting this decrease  however  was a management fee of  received in under the amended management services agreement with rio grande for start up costs related to implementing pending changes to the rio grande behavioral health network described below 
prior to july   the state of new mexico contracted with three health maintenance organization s and rio grande directly to administer a substantial portion of the state s behavioral health services to recipients including medicaid eligible recipients in southern new mexico 
the three health maintenance organizations  in turn  contracted with rio grande which had subcontracts with several not for profit providers in southern new mexico many of which comprise the rio grande behavioral health network to provide behavioral health services to medicaid eligible recipients 
in addition  rio grande contracted with us to provide it with certain management services 
effective july   the state of new mexico modified its behavioral health services delivery system  whereby it contracts with one administrative services entity to administer new and renewing contracts for behavioral health services 
in response to the modification of the state of new mexico s behavioral health services delivery system  the not for profit providers of the rio grande behavioral health network began contracting directly with the administrative services entity chosen by the state of new mexico 
the then existing provider subcontracts with rio grande were not renewed  however  the not for profit providers contracted with rio grande for certain administrative services 
in addition  six of the not for profit providers signed management services agreements with us 
the management fees pursuant to these management services agreements are based on a flat fee and in total is comparable to the per member per month based management fee we previously charged to rio grande 
management fees revenue related to rio grande was approximately million for and approximately million for operating expenses client service expense 
client service expense includes the following for and year ended december  percent change payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses total client service expense payroll and related costs 
to support our growth  provide high quality service and meet increasing compliance requirements expected by the government agencies with which we contract to provide services  we must hire and retain employees that possess higher degrees of education  experience and licensures 
as we enter new markets  we expect payroll and related costs to continue to increase 
as a result of increasing client numbers requiring us to hire additional service personnel  our payroll and related costs increased for  as compared to  as we added new direct care providers  administrative staff and other employees 
in addition  we added new employees in connection with the acquisition of pottsville  the aspen companies  cbh  maple star nevada  alphacare and drawbridges which resulted in an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately 
table of contents million for we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract in order to optimize the quality of service we provide while managing the payroll and related costs to provide these services 
determining our staffing needs may not directly coincide with the generation of revenue as we are required at times to increase our capacity to provide services prior to starting new contracts 
alternatively  we may lag behind in client referrals as we may have difficulty recruiting employees to staff our contracts 
furthermore  acquisitions may cause fluctuations in our payroll and related costs as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we attempt to merge new operations into our service delivery system

it is expected that the formation of spcic will enable us to provide for long term stable insurance programs  increased control over claims management and risk control administration and reduced overall insurance costs associated with general and professional liability and workers compensation insurance coverage 
we primarily utilize spcic as a risk management and cost containment tool 

table of contents our general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs are fronted by two third party insurers for a predetermined amount one for general and professional liability and one for workers compensation liability 
these third party insurers also provide coverage to certain designated entities managed by us 
spcic reinsures both of these third party insurers for claims as described below 
spcic reinsures the third party insurer for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per loss with no annual aggregate limit 
the reinsurance premium for the first policy year ending april  of approximately  covers the reinsured portion of the actuarially determined expected losses for the same period of approximately  and the operations budget of spcic of approximately  the third party insurer provides general and professional liability coverage up to  per occurrence in excess of the  reinsured limit with an annual aggregate limit of million for both the general liability and professional liability portions of the coverage 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information to support the required liability and related expense 
if our actual reinsured losses and the reinsured losses of certain designated entities we manage were to exceed the reinsured portion of the actuarially determined expected losses of approximately  in the first policy year ending april   our additional exposure would be recognized as an increase to our general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the period such exposure became known 
we also purchased an umbrella liability insurance policy with an effective date of july   providing additional coverage in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate in excess of the policy limits of the general and professional liability policy 
the general and professional liability policy limits  combined with the umbrella policy  are now million per occurrence with an annual aggregate limit of million 
under our workers compensation reinsurance program  spcic reinsures a third party insurer for the first  per occurrence with no annual aggregate limit 
the third party insurer provides workers compensation coverage up to statutory limits 
the reinsurance premium for the first policy year ending may  of approximately  equals the reinsured portion of the expected losses for the same period based upon our judgment using our past experience and industry experience 
if our actual reinsured losses and the reinsured losses of certain designated entities we manage were to exceed the reinsured portion of the expected losses of approximately  in the first policy year ending may   our additional exposure would be recognized as an increase to our payroll and related costs in our consolidated statements of operations in the period such exposure became known 
our reserve levels are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
any necessary adjustments are recognized as an adjustment to general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we record a provision for losses incurred but not reported  based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and our judgment using our past experience and industry experience 
at the end of each fiscal year  insurance regulations require that we record reserve levels equal to or greater than an independent actuary s estimate of expected losses 
on december   the end of spcic s fiscal year  we decreased our expected loss reserves by an immaterial amount to equal the independent actuary s estimate of expected losses of approximately  spcic has restricted cash of million at december   which is restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary and our judgment using historical data  and industry and our experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents any obligations above our reinsurance program limits are our responsibility 
approximately of the total liability assumed by spcic under its reinsurance programs is related to the designated entities managed by us that are covered under spcic s reinsurance programs 
health insurance effective july   we began offering our employees and employees of certain entities we manage an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
health claims under this program are self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for total claims up to million for the program year ending june  health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
beginning july   we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on the historical claim lag period and current payment trends of health insurance claims which is generally months 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately  as of december  is recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we charge our employees and employees of certain entities we manage a portion of the costs of our self funded and non self funded health programs  and we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
tax return examination in  the internal revenue service examined our tax return for the period july  to december  the examination concluded in december with no material effect to our financial position or results of operations
