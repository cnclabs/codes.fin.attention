the corporation made key additions to the leadership team in in addition to the recruitment of mr

the individuals hired bring many years of experience to their respective areas and are integral to achieving the long term earnings objectives of the corporation 
the corporation has renewed its commitment to growing its retail businesses 
many changes were made to retail lending  mortgage lending and deposit products during the year 
these changes  combined with the announcement of two new offices  are designed to improve financial performance by more appropriately balancing the revenue contribution of the retail businesses with the corporation s commercial business 
management examined the corporation s risk profile which had developed in recent years and sought to enhance several areas to better understand and mitigate such risks 
during the year  the corporation outsourced its internal audit function in order to enhance regulatory compliance and the internal audit of operations 
the corporation also recruited a new chief credit officer 
during the year  the loan portfolio was analyzed and credit quality stabilized 
improvements were made to loan underwriting  documentation and processing 
the corporation also continued to work towards ensuring compliance with a myriad of corporate governance requirements 
the corporation currently serves lorain county  eastern erie county and western cuyahoga county in northern ohio 
as such  the corporation s performance is impacted by general trends in the banking industry and by local economic conditions within the cleveland area 
in  portions of our historical market continued to struggle  while portions of the market in the eastern part of lorain county were expanding rapidly with high levels of residential construction 
the corporation opened two offices in in this part of lorain county  and plans to open offices in elyria and north ridgeville in efforts have also been made to align the retail products to be more competitive and successful in these markets  and sales oriented people have been added at many of the offices 
the corporation also announced plans for a business development office in cuyahoga county  ohio in in the second quarter of the corporation examined its staffing levels and made a number of difficult personnel decisions 
the cost of these staff reductions was recognized in the second quarter of however  the corporation also successfully recruited a number of talented sales people to implement the retail business plan 
the corporation s mission continues to be to meet the demands of the market with attractive customer solutions  whether these are free personal checking accounts or multi million dollar commercial loans 
the

key indicators and material trends dollars in thousands net interest income growth continues to be a challenge in the banking industry 
in absolute terms the corporation  like most banks  is dealing with smaller margins 
since the corporation is highly dependent on net interest income for its revenue  minimizing net interest margin compression is critical 
historically  the corporation has experienced net interest margin strength from the ability to grow and maintain a strong  low cost retail deposit base  and to grow and maintain a strong commercial lending operation 
the corporation s balance sheet generally is structured to benefit from rising rates  so as rates rose in  the corporation experienced net interest margin improvement as anticipated 
while the corporation continues to see improvement in its share of the deposit market in lorain county  it is increasingly becoming more dependent on wholesale funding sources to supplement local retail deposits 
while marketing and sales efforts have been expanded to attract and retain local retail deposits  a higher dependence on alternative funding sources is anticipated as the corporation grows 
generation of noninterest income is important to the long term success of the corporation 
in the last few years  total noninterest income has been fairly stable in total  but quite volatile in its components 
consequently  the focus in the future is expected to be on developing noninterest income sources that generate continuing revenue over time rather than from single transactions like loan sales and asset sales 
an important change in strategic direction in involved the corporation s subsidiary lnb mortgage  llc 
when this company was purchased in september  its financial performance was dependent upon fees generated by placing mortgages with other banks 
when interest rates increased in  there was a negative impact on mortgage company activity 
since this subsidiary was fee based during the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of  there were few family real estate loans generated for the corporation s loan portfolio 
the origination of family mortgages is a critical relationship building product for the corporation 
the new business plan for this product is to reintegrate the delivery of mortgages through the bank 
it is the corporation s view that long term profitability of mortgage lending will be through the interest income it can generate as part of the loan portfolio  combined with the potential gains on sale of mortgages into the secondary market if liquidity needs dictate 
in consideration of these factors  lnb mortgage  llc was wound up as a separate business 
asset quality generally is a key indicator of financial strength  and the corporation continues to manage credit risk aggressively 
there are indications that the corporation s credit quality has stabilized 
in  net charge offs were 
of average loans 
this compares to 
and 
in and  respectively 
the corporation perceives that credit quality has stabilized for several reasons 
over the last five years  the majority of the net charge offs occurred in the credit card  indirect loan  and commercial and industrial c i portfolios 
during this five year period  the corporation had net charge offs of approximately million and these three portfolios represented about of these charge offs 
the corporation is no longer in the credit card business  it has substantially reduced its presence in the indirect installment loan market and believes it has improved its underwriting and monitoring of c i loans 
however  nonperforming loans are still at levels that are not acceptable 
in  the level of nonperforming loans increased over the prior year from  at december  to  at december  approximately of these loans are commercial loans 
the balance of any one of these loans is relatively small less than  and they are generally well secured and have either been written down to their estimated collateral value or have had a specific reserve established 
the corporation also monitors the level of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that the corporation monitors very closely for performance and potential deterioration 
potential problem loans declined from million at december  to million at december  this was accomplished through more aggressive management of potential problem loans 
approximately million of this decline was due the sale of substandard loans 
the corporation s risk profile is slowly improving with a more disciplined loan underwriting on new loans and improved credit administration 

table of contents since the ability to generate deposits is a key indication of the corporation s ability to meet its liquidity needs and fund profitable asset growth  it is a significant measure of the success of the business plan 
in  as measured by the fdic at june   the corporation s market share of deposits grew to from in this compares to five years ago 
the corporation continues to do well in its historically strong city markets of lorain  elyria and amherst  but has only recently begun to open new offices in the faster growing parts of the county 
the performances of the new offices in avon and avon lake that were opened in have begun to contribute to market share improvement 
however  the corporation has growth objectives that require deposits to grow at a faster pace 
the alternative is more costly wholesale funds 
new branches are planned in and beyond  and are an indication of management s commitment to deploy resources into those areas of lorain county that are growing rapidly

in  net interest income increased due to the growth in assets  and an improvement in the net interest margin throughout the year 
towards year end the benefits from rising short term rates were being substantially offset by the flattening of the treasury yield curve and the impact of competition on loan and deposit pricing 
noninterest income was nearly unchanged  as lower trust fees and merchant services fees offset improved mortgage banking revenue and deposit service fees in the provision for loan losses decreased to  in from  in primarily due to improving charge off trends  improving trends in potential problem loans  and better asset quality management 
noninterest expenses increased in by due mainly to the costs associated with the recruitment of new management and expenses related to changes to the corporation s business strategy  products and processes

versus net interest income comparison net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation reviews net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which presents interest income with an adjustment for tax exempt interest income on an equivalent pre tax basis assuming a statutory federal tax rate in and a statutory federal tax rate in and these rates may differ from the corporation s actual effective tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes  rates and the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets

offsetting a portion of this improvement was competitive pricing pressures on loan and deposit yields 
the positive impact of rates is evident in as compared to the negative impact of rates in the rise in short term interest rates  triggering a basis point increase in the corporation s prime lending rate in  produced an increase in the yield on earning assets 
the yield on earnings assets was in  or basis points higher  as compared to in the yield on loans was in  or basis points higher  as compared to in the rise in short term interest rates also produced an increase in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities

partially offsetting this growth was runoff of real estate mortgages  direct installment and indirect installment loans 
commercial and home equity loan growth in was comparable with and the large increase in purchased loans is comprised of high quality new automobile loans originated by another bank in the cleveland area 
since the corporation has been reducing its presence in the indirect installment loan market due to excessive losses 
it also had not fully developed its retail loan products such as home equity lines to be competitive in the market 
the purchased loan program has been utilized as a short term substitute for the lack of locally generated installment loans 
in  the retail loan products were redesigned  and it is anticipated that the corporation s dependence on this source of loans will be less in future years 
the increase in average loans was primarily funded with growth in deposits 
noninterest bearing deposit growth was 
million  or  and interest 
table of contents bearing deposits grew million  or 
the interest bearing deposit growth was composed of retail time deposit growth of million  or  brokered time deposit growth of million  or and public time deposit growth of million  or 
the bank began to use brokered time deposits in as an alternative wholesale funding source 
brokered time deposits have become an important and comparably priced substitute for fhlb advances  and they require no collateralization as compared to fhlb advances which require collateral in the form of real estate mortgage loans and securities 
historically  the corporation has been structured to experience better net interest income performance when interest rates rise 
this basic balance sheet structure is evident in improved net interest income performance 
conversely  this structure was the primary reason for the margin deterioration experienced by the corporation during the falling rate environment in in  the corporation began to take measures to better manage the balance sheet structure to provide for less volatility when rates change 
some of these initiatives included the promotion of money market deposits to better match the variable rate loans that have been the historical emphasis of the corporation  as well as less aversion to the origination of fixed rate or adjustable rate loans 
this is expected to provide some benefit when rates begin to decline again 
rate volume net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
table presents an analysis of increases and decreases in interest income and expense in terms of changes in volume and interest rates during the two years ended december  and during the two years ended december  changes that are not due solely to either a change in volume or a change in rate have been allocated proportionally to both changes due to volume and rate

table of contents the impact of balance sheet growth and changing rates can be seen in table  which segments the change in net interest income into volume and rate components 
total interest income was  in as compared to  in this is an increase of  or 
of this increase   was due to volume and  to rate

total interest expense was  in as compared to  in this is an increase of  or 
of this increase   was due to volume and  to rate 
in  the impact of volume increased interest expense while the rates reduced interest expense 
although difficult to isolate  changing customer preferences and competition impact the rate and volume factors 
in the fourth quarter of  despite short term rates that were substantially higher than at the same time in  the corporation experienced flat net interest margin performance as compared to the same period last year 
the corporation still benefits from rising rates  but increasingly pricing pressures on loans and deposits  and a customer preference for time deposits  has reduced this benefit 
also impacting the net interest margin is a continuing shift of savings accounts to higher cost money market accounts and retail time deposits 
additionally  the corporation continues to increase its use of brokered time deposits 
while these funds are not more expensive than other wholesale funding sources  they are more expensive than deposits generated through our retail branch system 
versus net interest income comparison the corporation s net interest income was  in  which was a decline of from this follows a decrease in net interest income of in as compared to the corporation reviews net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which presents interest income with an adjustment for tax exempt interest income on an equivalent pre tax basis assuming a statutory federal tax rate in and a statutory federal tax rate in and these rates may differ from the corporation s actual effective tax rate 
the net interest margin was in  which is a decline of basis points from this follows a decrease of basis points in as compared to declining net interest income was primarily the result of the continued low interest rate environment through the first nine months of  coupled with the slow recovery of the local economy 
the negative impact of rates is much more pronounced in and than the impact of volume 
in and early  the corporation offset some of the net interest margin compression caused by declining rates with balance sheet growth 
however  for much of and into the middle of  assets grew much more slowly than the average asset growth rate in asset growth for did not occur until the latter part of the year  indicating that general economic conditions in the market were slowly improving 
net interest income and the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of were  and as compared to  and for the same period in also impacting the corporation s net interest income was a higher dependence on non core funding sources 
this trend is highlighted in table although these funds are not necessarily more expensive than other funding sources of comparable term  as our funding mix shifts from such extremely low cost sources  like savings accounts  to these alternative funding sources  the potential for further margin compression increases 
in  the corporation attempted to keep asset maturities short and loan volume on a variable rate basis to be properly positioned for the rising rate environment that began late in the year 
at december   the corporation s cumulative twelve month gap position was a positive million  which means that assets that could potentially reprice in the next twelve months exceeded liabilities by this amount 
consequently  the corporation was positioned to materially benefit from increases in interest rates in

the corporation experienced increased card usage in  but this was offset by reductions in visa s per transaction pricing 
electronic banking fees were lower in as the corporation made changes to its merchant service processing 
due to changes in mastercard pricing and capital requirements  the corporation outsourced the delivery of merchant processing in the fourth quarter 
this service had generated annual revenue in excess of million in prior years

the changes that would have been required to remain a mastercard merchant processor would have made this service unprofitable 
the gain on the sale of loans was in  representing an decrease from in these gains were primarily due to the sale of sba loans

the decline is attributable to the sale of four substandard loans for which specific reserves had been identified at december  potential problem loans are substandard and special mention loans other than nonperforming loans 
a summary of potential problem loans at december follows dollars in thousands potential problem loans potential problem loans are loans identified on management s classified credits list which include both loans that management has concern with the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms and loans that management is actively monitoring due to changes in the borrowers financial condition 
these loans and their potential loss exposure have been considered in management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents the level of potential problem loans rose significantly during and before stabilizing in the second quarter of this trend was due to local economic conditions and re grading of commercial credits using a new  more formal risk management process 
the economic factors which began as a general weakening of the local economy in began improving in the risk management process changes during the last three years have included the hiring of a new chief credit officer  the continued development of an independent loan administration function  additional loan review resources  and the adoption of a formal loan grading system 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million  a  or decrease from one year ago 
this decline was primarily due to the combination of a sale of approximately million of substandard loans  and the resolution of two large classified credits during the year 
at december   there are no particular industry concentrations of potential problem loans 
loan concentrations due to the nature of its commercial customer base  the corporation has historically and predominately been a secured real estate lender 
at december   approximately million  or of total portfolio loans was secured by real estate 
of this total  million was construction and land development and million was non farm  non residential loans 
this type of loan activity has lead to substantial relationships with developers in the corporation s market area 
credit risk is managed through the bank s loan loss review policy which provides the chief credit officer  loan review officer  lending officers  and the loan review committee with the responsibility to manage loan quality 
the corporation s credit policies are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order to remain suitable for the management of credit risks within the loan portfolio as conditions change 
for the five years ended december   there were no significant industry concentrations of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s operations are limited to three counties in ohio  so its loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in this three county area 
the corporation has no foreign loans outstanding and therefore no exposure to cross border lending 
loan quality provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the corporation s determination of the allowance  and the resulting provision  is based on judgments and assumptions  including general economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  loan loss experience  management s evaluation of credit risk relating to pools of loans and individual borrowers  sensitivity analysis and expected loss models  value of underlying collateral  and observations of internal loan review staff or banking regulators 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on the corporation s evaluation of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses under current economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

during this five year period the corporation had net charge offs of approximately million  and these three portfolios represented about of total net charge offs 
in the last three years  steps have been taken to address the net charge offs in these three portfolios 
the corporation is no longer in the credit card business after selling its portfolio in the corporation also substantially curtailed its indirect installment loan business 
these loans totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  this is a decline of  or 
the corporation s exposure to c i lending has also stabilized 
after rapidly increasing from million at december   to million at december   this portfolio has stabilized 
the c i balances were at the same level in at million as compared to million at december  this type of lending was monitored more closely until the underwriting and credit administration were in place to manage this type of lending 
in  the level of nonperforming loans increased over the prior year from  at december  to  at december  approximately of these loans are commercial loans 
the average balance of these loans is relatively low  and they are well secured  and those that might have collateral deficiencies have either been written down to their estimated collateral value or have had a specific reserve established 
approximately of these loans involve an sba guarantee 
the process to be reimbursed by the sba for these loans occurs after the collateral has been liquidated and the paperwork has been submitted to the sba 
this process can take many months 
potential problem loans are loans that the corporation monitors very closely for performance and potential deterioration 
potential problem loans declined from million at december  to million at december  this was accomplished through more aggressive management of potential problem loans 
the corporation s risk profile is slowly improving with a more disciplined loan underwriting on new credits and improved credit administration

the corporation also generates funds through wholesale sources that include local borrowings generated by a business sweep product 
the corporation utilizes brokered time deposits to provide term funding at rates comparable to other wholesale funding sources

liquidity management of liquidity is a continual process in the banking industry 
the liquidity of the bank reflects its ability to meet loan demand  the possible outflow of deposits and its ability to take advantage of market opportunities made possible by potential rate environments 
assuring adequate liquidity is achieved by managing the cashflow characteristics of the assets the bank originates and the availability of alternative funding sources 
the bank monitors liquidity according to limits established in its liquidity policy 
the policy establishes minimums for the ratio of cash and cash equivalents to total assets and the loan to deposit ratio 
at december  the bank was in compliance with these policy limits 
in addition to maintaining a stable source of core deposits  the bank manages adequate liquidity by assuring continual cashflow in the securities portfolio

it follows general practices within the banking industry and application of these principles requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies are fundamental to the understanding of results of operation and financial conditions 
the accounting policies considered to be critical by management are as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay 
determination of the allowance is subjective in nature 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectibility of the loan is unlikely 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 

table of contents a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract 
residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are written down by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of all loans currently evaluated for impairment is collateral dependent and therefore the fair value is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the corporation maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance representing estimations pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
many factors are considered when these grades are assigned to individual loans such as current and past delinquency  financial statements of the borrower  current net realizable value of collateral and the general economic environment and specific economic trends affecting the portfolio 
for residential real estate  installment and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on corporation s historical loss experience and are reviewed for appropriateness on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all classified loans when management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
pension accounting four key variables are used for calculating the annual pension cost size of employee population has stayed more or less stagnant over the last few years  thereby causing pension cost relating to this variable to be more or less the same 
actuarial assumptions are required for mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not change over time  so the range of assumptions and their impact on pension expense is generally narrow 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets are based on the balance in the pension asset portfolio at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time 
the expected long term rate of return is generally held constant so the pattern of income expense recognition more closely matches the stable pattern of services provided by the employees over the life of pension obligation 
at december  the expected long term rate of return on plan asset was 
a discount rate is used to determine the present value of the future benefit obligations

sfas no 
requires the periodic review and adjustment of tax assets and liabilities based on many assumptions 
these assumptions include predictions as to the corporation s future profitability  as well as potential changes in tax laws that could impact the deductibility of certain income and expense items 
since financial results could be significantly different than these estimates  future adjustments may be necessary to tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
impacts of recent accounting pronouncements management is not aware of any proposed regulations or current recommendations by the financial accounting standards board or by regulatory authorities  which  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources  or operations of the corporation

sfas no 
r will require the corporation to expense share based payments  including employee stock options  based on their fair value 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the first adoption method is a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date i based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and ii based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the second adoption method is a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either i all prior periods presented or ii prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
the corporation is required to adopt sfas no 
r effective as of january  as permitted by sfas no 
 the corporation currently accounts for share based payments to employees under apb opinion using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will impact the corporation s results of operations 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be estimated at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the corporation adopted sfas no

table of contents eitf no the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
generally  an impairment is considered other than temporary unless the investor has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized through earnings equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting requirements of eitf until additional implementation guidance was issued and placed into effect 
in june  the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment  but directed the fasb staff to issue a fasb staff position fsp which will be re titled fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the final fsp will supersede eitf and eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
fsp fas will replace guidance in eitf on loss recognition with references to existing other than temporary impairment guidance  such as fasb statement no

fsp fas will clarify that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
fsp fas will be effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after september  the company has consistently followed the loss recognition guidance in sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk that a financial institution s earnings and capital or its ability to meet its business objectives will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices 
these include interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads and commodity prices 
for the corporation  the dominant market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
the negative effect of this exposure is felt through the net interest spread  mortgage banking revenues and the market values of various assets and liabilities 
the corporation manages market risk through its asset liability management committee alco at the bank level 
this committee assesses interest rate risk exposure through two primary measures rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities and earnings at risk simulation of net interest income 
the difference between a financial institution s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities is referred to as the interest rate gap 
an institution that has more interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities in a given period is said to be asset sensitive or has a positive gap 
this means that if interest rates rise a corporation s net interest income may rise and if interest rates fall its net interest income may decline 
if interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets then the opposite impact on net interest income may occur 
the usefulness of the gap measure is limited 
it is important to know the gross dollars of assets and liabilities that reprice in various time horizons  but without knowing the frequency and basis of the potential rate changes its predictive power is limited 
the gap information for the corporation is presented in table for the year ended december  two more useful tools are earnings at risk simulation and economic value of equity simulation 
an earnings at risk analysis is a dynamic modeling approach that combines the repricing information from gap analysis  with forecasts of balance sheet growth and changes in future interest rates 
the result of this simulation provides management with a range of possible net interest margin outcomes 
trends that are identified in earnings at risk simulation can help identify product and pricing decisions that can be made currently to assure stable net interest income performance in the future 
at december   a shock treatment of the balance sheet  in which a parallel shift in the yield curve occurs and all rates increase immediately  indicates that in a basis point shock  net interest income would increase and in a basis point shock  net interest income would decrease 
the reason for the lack of symmetry in these results is the implied floors in many of the corporation s core funding which limits their downward adjustment from current offering rates 
this analysis is done to describe a best or worst case scenario 
factors such as non parallel yield curve shifts  management pricing changes  customer preferences  competitive pressures and other factors are likely to produce different results 
the economic value of equity eve approach measures the change in the value of the corporation s equity as the value of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet change with interest rates 
at december   this analysis indicated that a basis point change in rates would reduce the value of the corporation s equity by while a basis point change in rates would increase the value of the corporation s equity by
