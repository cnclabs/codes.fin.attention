item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
in this report  atherogenics  we  us and our refer to atherogenics  inc this annual report contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are subject to certain factors  risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  events and performances to differ materially from those referred to in such statements 
these risks include statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  such as projections about our future results of operations or financial condition  research  development and commercialization of our product candidates  anticipated trends in our business  and other risks that could cause actual results to differ materially 
you should carefully consider these risks  which are discussed in this annual report  including  without limitation  in the sections entitled risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in atherogenics sec filings 
overview atherogenics is a research based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  including coronary heart disease  organ transplant rejection  rheumatoid arthritis and asthma 
we have developed a proprietary vascular protectant  or v protectant  technology platform to discover drugs to treat these types of diseases 
based on our v protectant platform  we have two drug development programs in clinical trials and are pursuing a number of other preclinical programs 
agi  our first candidate  is our v protectant that is most advanced in clinical development 
agi is designed to benefit patients with coronary heart disease  or chd  which is atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the heart 
we are currently evaluating agi in the phase iii clinical trial called arise aggressive reduction of inflammation stops events as an oral therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis 
in december  we announced a license and collaboration agreement with astrazeneca for the global development and commercialization of agi under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront license fee of million and  subject to the achievement of specific milestones  including a successful outcome in arise  we will be eligible for development and regulatory milestones of up to an aggregate of million 
the agreement also provides for progressively demanding sales performance related milestones of up to an additional million in the aggregate 
in addition  we will also receive royalties on product sales 
astrazeneca has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement at specified periods as further described above in item business collaborations 
agi  our second candidate  is a novel antioxidant and selective anti inflammatory agent that is being developed to address the accelerated inflammation of grafted blood vessels  known as transplant arteritis  common in chronic organ transplant rejection 
we are working with astellas pharma inc to further develop agi in preclinical and early stage clinical trials 
we previously were developing agix  a v protectant candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
based on our findings  however  we have discontinued clinical development of agix for rheumatoid arthritis 
we continue to have an active program aimed at investigating other v protectants in rheumatoid arthritis and are working to select another candidate to move into formal preclinical development 
we have also identified additional potential v protectant candidates to treat other chronic inflammatory diseases  including asthma 
we are evaluating these v protectants to determine lead drug candidates for clinical development 
we plan to develop these compounds rapidly and may seek regulatory fast track status  if available  to expedite development and commercialization 

table of contents the following table provides information regarding our research and development expenses for our major product candidates year ended december  direct external costs agi agix unallocated costs and other programs total research and development from inception  we have devoted the large majority of our research and development efforts and financial resources to support development of the agi product candidate 
we will retain responsibility for the ongoing arise clinical trial and for regulatory filings in the united states 
astrazeneca will have full responsibility for pre commercialization activities involving agi and will oversee all aspects of the marketing  sales and distribution of agi on a worldwide basis 
astrazeneca will also be responsible for all non us regulatory filings 
spending for the agi program in  and was funded by our collaborative development partner  astellas 
in  we discontinued clinical development of agix the nature  timing and costs of the efforts to complete the successful development of any of our product candidates are highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks  and therefore cannot be accurately estimated 
these risks include the rate of progress and costs of our clinical trials  clinical trial results  cost and timing of regulatory approval and establishing commercial manufacturing supplies 
these risks and uncertainties  and their effect on our operations and financial position  are more fully described above in our risk factors under the headings risks related to development and commercialization of our product candidates and dependence on third parties and risks related to regulatory approval of our product candidates 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales 
we expect to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenue as we continue to increase research and development costs 
we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity and debt securities 
we have incurred significant losses since we began operations and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you that we will become profitable or receive any milestone related revenues under our agreement with astrazeneca 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the successful development of our product candidates  to obtain required regulatory clearances and to manufacture and market our future products 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could significantly differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following policies and related estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
a description of these critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with these policies are set forth below 
the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are also discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents research and development accrual as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate expenses that we believe we have incurred  but have not yet been billed for 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of expenses for which we accrue include fees for professional services  such as those provided by certain clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
we make these estimates based upon progress of activities related to contractual obligations and also information received from vendors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab 
sab provides guidance in applying us generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for upfront  nonrefundable fees received in connection with research collaboration agreements 
in accordance with sab  license fees  which are nonrefundable  are recognized when the related license agreements specify that no further efforts or obligations are required of us 
in february  we received a million license fee in connection with our license and collaboration agreement with astrazeneca 
the upfront license payment will be recognized over the period that we estimate we are obligated to provide services to the licensee 
in  revenues will be approximately million related to the amortization of the upfront license fee from astrazeneca 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for our stock based employee compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  an amendment to sfas  requires disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb sfas r requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with stock option grants and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements and became effective as of january  sfas r applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r as of january  and we intend to use the modified prospective method and the black scholes valuation model for valuing share based payments 
we expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations and net loss per share 
the actual impact of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock option grants and changes in valuation assumptions 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as previously described in the pro forma disclosures 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during or expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increased expenditures for the agi arise phase iii clinical trial  including manufacturing activities for clinical drug supply  study monitoring  payments to clinical investigators and salary and personnel related expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses in will be approximately equal to the level 
expenses in will be primarily related to activities surrounding the agi arise phase iii clinical trial and regulatory activities related to us nda preparation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to an increase in the cost of agi business development activities  including legal fees for the license and collaboration agreement with astrazeneca and market research costs 
also contributing to the increase were higher legal fees related to the class action lawsuit 
interest and other income interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest income earned on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income was million in  compared to million in the increase is due to the additional funds received from the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in january along with an increase in rates on our interest bearing accounts 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is due to the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in january income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards and the research and development credit carryforwards will expire between and because of our lack of earnings history  the resulting deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the utilization of the carryforwards is dependent upon the timing and extent of our future profitability 
the annual limitations combined with the expiration dates of the carryforwards may prevent the utilization of all of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards if we do not attain sufficient profitability by the expiration dates of the carryforwards

the borrowing period under the equipment loan facility  as modified  expired on september  the equipment loan facility was paid in full during in june  we entered into an equipment loan for approximately  for the purchase of software and computer equipment 
the loan is payable over months at an annual interest rate of

table of contents the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases long term debt total contractual obligations based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including those factors potentially impacting our financial condition as discussed in item a 
risk factors and the following the scope and results of our research  preclinical and clinical development activities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our potential product candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  our ability to maintain our collaborations with astrazeneca and astellas and the financial terms of our collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  the costs related to purported class action lawsuits filed against us  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies 
we have historically accessed the capital markets from time to time to raise adequate funds for operating needs and cash reserves 
although we believe we have adequate cash for at least the next months  we may access capital markets when we believe market conditions or company needs merit doing so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  all of which have a minimum investment rating of a p  money market funds  and government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short 
table of contents term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
