item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations net interest income net interest income is determined by calculating the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to taxable equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
the tax equivalent adjustments to net interest income for   and were   and  respectively 
vs reported net interest income decreased  or from the year ended december  to total interest income increased  and is attributed to the increase of  in the average balance of the loan portfolio coupled with an increase of the tax equivalent yield on investment securities of basis points offset partially by a decrease in the average balance of the investment securities of  on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased to  from  for the year ended december  the tax equivalent interest income on the investment portfolio remained stable despite a decrease in the average balance of the investment portfolio of  offsetting the decline in average balance of the portfolio was a shift in the portfolio to tax exempt bonds from taxable 
this repositioning was undertaken to provide portfolio call protection  strategic investment at the community level  and as part of the company s tax strategy 
the net growth in the volume of the loan portfolio has generated additional interest income that has offset the basis point increase in the overall yield of the portfolio 
for the year ended december   reported interest expense increased  over the same period of over half of the increased level of interest expense was due to market driven increases in the rates paid on deposit accounts 
the increases are primarily the result of the continued rate increases enacted by the federal open markets committee fomc coupled with aggressive pricing competition for deposits 
in addition  deposit dollars have shifted from lower rate transaction based accounts to higher rate time deposits over the past year 
this shift has resulted in the average balance of time deposits increasing  in as compared to the shift in dollars and the fomc rate increases resulted in the average rate paid on deposits increasing to from for the year ended december  with the time deposit portfolio average rate increasing basis points over the time period 
the company increased long term borrowing during through the fhlb to minimize future borrowing costs and to enhance liability positioning 
these additional borrowings were utilized by management to replace maturing debt and to supplement the funding of the growth in the loan portfolio 
the increase in the expense on long term borrowings is the result of average balances of long term fhlb borrowings increasing  while the weighted average interest rate on the long term debt remained constant 
short term borrowing interest increased  as a result of the before mentioned fomc rate increases and an increase of the average balances outstanding during the year of  vs reported net interest income increased  or from fiscal to total interest income increased  and is attributed to the increase of  in the average balance of the loan portfolio offset partially by the decrease in the average balance of the investment securities of  and a decrease in the return of loans of basis points 
on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased or  to  in a period when both average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities increased 
the increase of taxable security income of  is due to the purchases of us government securities over the past year  with the average of these securities increasing  while the decrease in the average of tax exempt state political securities decreased tax equivalent interest income  the investment portfolio has been repositioned from longer term assets to shorter term assets to take advantage of the cash flow opportunities for reinvestment in anticipation of rising rates 
the net growth in the volume of the loan portfolio has generated additional interest income that has offset the basis point decline in the overall earning asset weighted average interest rate 
within the loan portfolio  a basis point decrease of the tax equivalent return on loans was offset by an increase of  in the average balance of loans when comparing the year to the year variable rate loans within the portfolio and other new loan originations at lower effective rates aided in the reduction of income compared to a year ago because of the historically low rates 
for the year ended december   reported interest expense decreased  or over the same period of lower rates for all deposit accounts contributed the most substantial decrease in interest expense 
the weighted average rate on deposits declined basis points for as compared to interest expense on time deposits decreased  due to both the basis point decline in the weighted average rate and the decrease in the average balance of  during  the company borrowed an additional  in long term advances through the fhlb to minimize future borrowing costs and to enhance liability positioning 
these additional borrowings were utilized by management to fund the substantial loan growth of the  increase in expense on long term borrowings is the result of average balances of long term fhlb borrowings increasing  partially offset by the basis point decline in the resulting weighted average interest rate for the year ending december  compared to the same period in interest paid on short term borrowings increased  as a result of an increase of the average balances outstanding during the year of  the opportunity to borrow from the federal home loan bank at historically low interest rates was utilized to assist the funding of the loan portfolio growth and is attributed to the increase of interest expense paid on borrowings

loan portfolio gross loans for the year ended december   increased to  from  at december  the increase was concentrated in real estate mortgages which increased  as a whole from december  to commercial and agricultural loans and installment loans increased  and  respectively 
the growth in real estate secured loans is part of the company s overall lending strategy to underwrite well collateralized real estate loans 
the opening of the atherton street  state college along with a home equity loan campaign also assisted in increasing real estate loans 
commercial and individuals loan categories increased modestly as the company broadens its lending base and expands its market coverage

the allowance method is used in providing for loan losses 
accordingly  all loan losses are charged to the allowance and all recoveries are credited to it 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to operations 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio

nonperforming loans non accrual loans decreased  from year end as several commercial real estate loans were foreclosed during overall nonperforming loans decreased  to  from fiscal year end the following table presents information concerning nonperforming loans 
the accrual of interest will be discontinued when the principal or interest of a loan is in default for days or more  or as soon as payment is questionable  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
consumer loans and residential real estate loans secured by to family dwellings shall ordinarily not be subject to those guidelines 
the reversal of previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to any loan placed in a nonaccrual status and the treatment of subsequent payments of either principal or interest will be handled in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles do not require a write off of previously accrued interest if principal and interest are ultimately protected by sound collateral values 
a nonperforming loan may be restored to an accruing status when principal and interest is no longer due and unpaid 
it becomes well secured and in the process of collection 
prospects for future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
total nonperforming loans days in thousands nonaccrual past due total the level of nonaccruing loans continues to fluctuate annually and is attributed to the various economic factors experienced both regionally and nationally 
overall the portfolio is well secured with a majority of the balance making regular payments or scheduled to be satisfied in the near future 
presently there are no significant amounts of loans where serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the current loan payment terms which are not included in the nonperforming categories as indicated above

bank regulators have risk based capital guidelines 
under these guidelines the company and bank are required to maintain minimum ratios of core capital and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items 
at december   both the company s and bank s required ratios were well above the minimum ratios as follows minimum company bank standards tier capital ratio total capital ratio for a more comprehensive discussion of these requirements  see regulation and supervision in item of the form k 
management believes that the company will continue to exceed regulatory capital requirements 
return on equity and assets the ratio of net income to average total assets and average shareholders equity and other certain equity ratios are presented as follows percentage of net income to average total assets average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared to net income percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and market risk fundamental objectives of the company s asset liability management process are to maintain adequate liquidity while minimizing interest rate risk 
the maintenance of adequate liquidity provides the company with the ability to meet its financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  and shareholders 
additionally  it provides funds for normal operating expenditures and business opportunities as they arise 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to increase net interest income by managing interest sensitive assets and liabilities in such a way that they can be repriced in response to changes in market interest rates 
the company  like other financial institutions  must have sufficient funds available to meet its liquidity needs for deposit withdrawals  loan commitments  and expenses 
in order to control cash flow  the bank estimates future flows of cash from deposits and loan payments 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  as well as federal home loan bank borrowings 
funds generated are used principally to fund loans and purchase investment securities 
management believes the company has adequate resources to meet its normal funding requirements 
management monitors the company s liquidity on both a long and short term basis thereby  providing management necessary information to react to current balance sheet trends 
cash flow needs are assessed and sources of funds are determined 
funding strategies consider both customer needs and economical cost 
both short and long term funding needs are addressed by maturities and sales of available for sale investment securities  loan repayments and maturities  and liquidating money market investments such as federal funds sold 
the use of these resources  in conjunction with access to credit provides core ingredients to satisfy depositor  borrower  and creditor needs 
management monitors and determines the desirable level of liquidity 
consideration is given to loan demand  investment opportunities  deposit pricing and growth potential as well as the current cost of borrowing funds 
the company has a current borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of  in addition to this credit arrangement the company has additional lines of credit with correspondent banks of  the company s management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy estimated short term and long term funding needs 
federal home loan bank borrowings totaled  as of december  interest rate sensitivity  which is closely related to liquidity management  is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
asset liability management strives to match maturities and rates between loan and investment security assets with the deposit liabilities and borrowings that fund them 
successful asset liability management results in a balance sheet structure which can cope effectively with market rate fluctuations 
the matching process is affected by segmenting both assets and liabilities into future time periods usually months  or less based upon when repricing can be effected 
repriceable assets are subtracted from repriceable liabilities  for a specific time period to determine the gap  or difference 
once known  the gap is managed based on predictions about future market interest rates 
intentional mismatching  or gapping  can enhance net interest income if market rates move as predicted 
however  if market rates behave in a manner contrary to predictions  net interest income will suffer 
gaps  therefore  contain an element of risk and must be prudently managed 
in addition to gap management  the company has an asset liability management policy which incorporates a market value at risk calculation which is used to determine the effects of interest rate movements on shareholders equity and a simulation analysis to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the company s balance sheets 
interest rate sensitivity in this analysis the company examines the result of a and basis point change in market interest rates and the effect on net interest income 
it is assumed that the change is instantaneous and that all rates move in a parallel manner 
assumptions are also made concerning prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities 
the following is a rate shock forecast for the twelve month period ended december  assuming a static balance sheet as of december  in thousands 
parallel rate shock in basis points static net interest income change from static the model utilized to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flow from principal repayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change 
in addition  the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change 
generally  management believes the company is well positioned to respond expeditiously when the market interest rate outlook changes 
inflation the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is primarily monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates rather than inflation have a more significant impact on the company s performance 
interest rates are not always affected in the same direction or magnitude as prices of other goods and services  but are reflective of fiscal policy initiatives or economic factors that are not measured by a price index 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
the accounting policies are described in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description or our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
other than temporary impairment of equity securities equity securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reason underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing impairment  refer to note of notes and consolidated financial statements of the form k 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  refer to note of notes and consolidated financial statements of the form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company must assess goodwill and other intangible assets each year for impairment 
this assessment involves estimating cash flows for future periods 
if the future cash flows were less than the recorded goodwill and other intangible assets balances  we would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the assets to the lower value 
deferred tax assets we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
our deferred tax assets are described further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the corporation has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations which may require future cash payments 
the following table presents in thousands  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date
