item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information for further details 
we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation  exclusively within the united states and canada 
overview cabot oil gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition  exploitation  production and marketing of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america 
we also transport  store  gather and produce natural gas for resale 
our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital drilling opportunities  acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and  the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices 
our realized natural gas and crude oil price was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments 
in an effort to manage commodity price risk  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps 
these financial instruments are an element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a

prices  including the realized impact of derivative instruments  rose for natural gas and for oil 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate in total capital and exploration expenditures increased by million to million  of which million was for property acquisitions  in compared to million for we believe our operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately million and again provide excess cash flow 
any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions  to pay current debt due  repurchase common stock  expand our capital program or other opportunities 
our strategy will remain consistent with we will remain focused on our strategies of balancing our capital investments between higher risk projects with the potential for higher returns and lower risk projects with more stable returns  along with balancing longer life investments with impact exploration opportunities 
in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information

table of contents financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary source of cash in was from funds generated from operations  as well as borrowings on our revolving credit facility and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock plans 
we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years 
working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables 
during  approximately bcfe of expected production in our gulf coast region was deferred due to the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita 
these hurricanes did not have a material adverse impact on our capital resources nor liquidity 
fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures  purchase treasury stock and pay dividends 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans during partially offset our repurchase of  treasury shares of common stock at a weighted average purchase price of 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used by investing activities cash flows provided used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million over this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices 
key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
average realized natural gas prices increased over  while crude oil realized prices increased over the same period 
production volumes declined slightly  with a less than one percent reduction of equivalent production in compared to while we believe commodity production may exceed levels  we are unable to predict future commodity prices  and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million over this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices

average realized natural gas prices increased over  while crude oil realized prices increased over the same period 
production volumes declined  with a reduction of equivalent production in compared to see results of operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 
investing activities 
the primary uses of cash by investing activities are capital spending and exploration expense 
we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended december  and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the east region and the rocky mountains area of our west region in response to higher commodity prices 
our continued drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase 
in addition  we spent million in proved property acquisitions  primarily in the gulf coast 
the increase from to was also primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in response to higher commodity prices 
this increase largely occurred in our east region and the rocky mountains area of our west region 
our initial drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase 

table of contents financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   resulting from borrowings under the credit facility  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments 
cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december  were million 
this is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments 
cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december  were million 
this is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our credit facility 
the credit facility provides for an available credit line of million  which can be expanded up to million  either with the existing banks or new banks 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including potential acquisitions 
in august  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
as a result of the for stock split effected in march  this figure has been adjusted to three million shares 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 
all purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions 
there is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase our securities 
the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of december  was  see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information 
capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million of current portion of long term debt at both december  and includes million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million on our common stock 
a regular dividend of per share of common stock  or per share for dividends prior to the for stock split as adjusted for the split  has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding significant oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

table of contents the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expense total we plan to drill about gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from million in capital and exploration expenditures in included a layer of million in proved property acquisitions as shown in the table above 
we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period 
in management expects an increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate due to negative reserve revisions and higher capital costs 
this change may result in an increase of depreciation  depletion and amortization of to greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 
contractual obligations our known material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt  firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt interest on long term debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations including current portion 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our million long term debt outstanding at december  interest payments on the million of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the maturity date and by assuming a constant interest rate of which was the december  interest rate 
actual results will likely differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements and drilling rig commitments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  is million 
subsequent to december   we entered into an agreement for one additional drilling rig in the gulf coast 
the total commitment over the next four years is million  of which million  million  million and million will be paid out during the years   and  respectively 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the most significant policies are discussed below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate 
the estimation of reserves in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation 
the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
since  of our reserves have been reviewed by miller lents  ltd  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a impact on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to dd a 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties  and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

table of contents carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
in  we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field 
in december  our remaining interest in the field was sold 
for additional discussion on the kurten field impairment see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in and  there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively per year 
in the past  the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions 
average property lives in the gulf coast  east and west regions have been four  seven and seven years  respectively 
average property lives in canada are estimated to be six years 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
under sfas no 
 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas no 
test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue  either in natural gas production or crude oil and condensate revenue  on the statement of operations 
long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities 
in order to select the discount rate  we use benchmarks such as the 
table of contents moody s aa corporate rate  which was annualized for  and the citigroup pension liability index  which was for we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments 
we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of at december  is reasonable 
in order to value our pension liabilities  we use the rp mortality table 
this is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities 
this table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the prior years group annuity mortality table  and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans 
another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection 
we have assumed that salaries will increase based on our expectation of future salary increases 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan 
in our pension calculations  we have used as the expected long term return on plan assets for  and however  we expect to achieve a minimum annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term 
we believe that this is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 
the actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately 
we generally target a portfolio of assets that are within a range of approximately to for equity securities and approximately to for fixed income securities 
large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of of the portfolio 
small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of and  respectively  of the portfolio 
fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of of our portfolio 
stock based compensation prior to the issuance of sfas no 
r share based payment revised  there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock based compensation 
the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the second method is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
as of december   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equity based compensation must be expensed at the grant date 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
we currently expense performance share awards  however  beginning in the first quarter of  we will be required to expense all stock based compensation 
further discussion of sfas no 
r and stock compensation is included in recently issued accounting pronouncements 
on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration to december  of the vesting of  unvested stock options awarded in february under our second amended and restated long term incentive plan and  unvested stock options awarded in april under our incentive plan 
the  shares awarded to employees under the plan at an exercise price of would have vested in february the  shares awarded to non employee directors under the plan at an exercise price of would have vested  shares in april and april  respectively 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options  which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees  was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents the accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the acceleration of vesting is expected to reduce our compensation expense related to these options by approximately million for other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production  natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation  federal regulation of petroleum and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 
limited partnership 
as part of the cody acquisition  we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field  as general partner of a partnership and as an operator 
we had approximately a interest in the field  including a one percent interest in the partnership 
under the partnership agreement  we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to upon the limited partner reaching payout 
based on the addition of this reversionary interest  and because the field has over a year reserve life  approximately million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition 
additionally  the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 
effective february   liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner 
the limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator 
their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices  primarily oil  since their investment in we proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
additionally  we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 
pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field  the limited partner s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation  an impairment review was performed which required an impairment charge in the first quarter of of million million after tax 
this impairment charge is reflected in the statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

table of contents commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company 
fin no 
states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable 
this interpretation is intended to provide more information about long lived assets  more information about future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this interpretation  since we currently record all asset retirement obligations 
on april   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas accounting for suspended well costs 
this staff position amends fasb statement no 
financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting 
the position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if a sufficient quantity of reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well s economic and operating feasibility 
if the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria  these costs should be expensed  net of any salvage value 
additional annual disclosures are required to provide information about management s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs 
in addition  the staff position requires the annual disclosure of net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves  the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to 
further  the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects  the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation 
for our disclosures  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
in order to enhance financial reporting consistency between periods  sfas no 
modifies the requirements for the accounting and reporting of the direct effects of changes in accounting principles 
under apb opinion no 
 the cumulative effect of voluntary changes in accounting principle 
table of contents was recognized in net income in the period of the change 
unlike the treatment previously prescribed by apb opinion no 
 retrospective application is now required  unless it is not practical to determine the specific effects in each period or the cumulative effect 
if the period specific effects cannot be determined  it is required that the new accounting principle must be retrospectively applied in the earliest period possible to the balance sheet accounts and a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or another equity account 
if the cumulative effect cannot be determined  it is necessary to apply the new accounting principles prospectively at the earliest practical date 
if it is not feasible to retrospectively apply the change in principle  the reason that this is not possible and the method used to report the change is required to be disclosed 
the statement also provides that changes in accounting for depreciation  depletion or amortization should be treated as changes in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle and that disclosure of the preferability of the change is required 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services provided by employee to employer 
the statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity based compensation at the grant date 
the statement does not require a certain type of valuation model  and either a binomial or black scholes model may be used 
during the first quarter of  the securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this standard 
in april  the sec took further action to amend regulation s x to state that the provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  for all non small business issuers 
as a result  we will not adopt this sfas until the first quarter of we plan to use the modified prospective application method as detailed in sfas no

at this time  management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will materially impact our operating results  nor will there be any impact on our future cash flows 
see stock based compensation below for further information 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
this fsp provides guidance on the definition and practical application of grant date as described in sfas no 
r 
the grant date is described as the date that the employee and employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award 
the other elements of the definition of grant date are the award must be authorized  the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and the employee is affected by changes in the company s stock price 
to determine the grant date  we are allowed to use the date the award is approved in accordance with our corporate governance requirements so long as the three elements described above are met 
furthermore  the recipient cannot negotiate the award s terms and conditions with the employer and the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short time period from the approval date 
we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  which provides a simpler  more practical transition election relating to the calculation of the apic pool 
the apic pool is defined as the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies occurring after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
under this fsp  companies can elect to perform simpler computations to derive the beginning balance of the apic pool as well as the impact on the apic pool of fully vested and outstanding awards as of the sfas no 
r adoption date 
the beginning balance can be computed by taking the sum of all tax benefits incurred prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r from stock based compensation plans less the tax effected using a blended statutory rate pro forma stock based compensation cost 
in addition  increases to the apic pool for fully vested awards can be calculated by multiplying the tax rate times the tax benefit of the deduction 
the calculation of any awards that are partially vested or granted after the sfas no 
r adoption date will not be affected by this fsp and will be calculated in accordance with sfas no 
r which requires that only the excess tax benefit or deficiency of the tax deduction over the tax effect of the compensation cost recognized should be considered for the apic pool 
also under the fsp  all tax benefits recognized on fully vested awards and the excess tax benefits for partially vested and new awards will be reported on the statement of cash flows as a component of financing activities 
companies will have up to one year after adopting sfas no 
r to decide to elect and disclose whether they plan to use the alternative method or the original method prescribed in sfas no 
r for the calculation of the apic pool 
we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no

table of contents in february  the fasb issued fsp fas r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
within certain share based payment plans  a company can be required to settle outstanding options upon the occurrence of certain events  such as a change in control or liquidity of a company or the death or disability of the shareholder 
this fsp amends paragraphs and a of sfas no 
r to incorporate a probability assessment by a company 
under sfas no 
r  it is required that options and similar instruments be classified as liabilities if the entity can be required under any circumstances to settle the instrument in cash or other assets 
under the fsp  a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside of the employee s control does not meet the criteria for liability classification  and should remain to be classified in equity  unless it becomes probable that the contingent event will occur 
the effective date for the guidance in this fsp is upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
r 
we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no

in addition  the slight increase in production was due to the successful drilling programs in the east  west and canada 
partially offsetting this was the decrease in the gulf coast production 
the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the increase in production resulted in a net revenue increase of million

the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the decrease in the gulf coast region production due to the continued natural decline of the cl f lease in south louisiana  as well as the impact of hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at the breton sound offshore lease  one of our largest areas of offshore oil production

however  the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 
other operating revenues other operating revenues decreased million 
this change was primarily a result of an increase in our payout liability associated with the reduction of our interest due to customary reversionary interest owned by others  which correspondingly decreased other operating revenues 
in addition  our revenues from net profits interest declined over the prior year 
this revenue variance also results  to a lesser extent  from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year 
operating expenses total costs and expenses from operations increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows exploration expense increased million in  primarily as a result of increased dry hole expenses partially offset by decreased spending on geological and geophysical expenses 
during  we spent million less on geological and geophysical activities but incurred an additional million in dry hole expense 
in addition  we spent an additional million on delay rentals 
the increase in dry hole expense is mainly due to expenses incurred in the gulf coast and  to a smaller extent  in canada and the west 
taxes other than income increased by million from compared to  primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices 
additionally  ad valorem and franchise taxes were higher compared to the prior year 
brokered natural gas cost increased by million from to see the preceding table labeled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis 
direct operations expense increased by million 
this is primarily the result of increased expenses for outside operated properties and workovers 
in addition  there were increases over the prior year in maintenance charges  equipment expenses and employee related expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million in this is primarily due to an increase in offshore dd a rates associated with the commencement of offshore production in late and increased production in the east and west regions 

table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by million as we incurred no impairment expense in the current year 
the costs incurred in the prior year related to a field in south louisiana 
further analysis of this impairment is discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of unproved properties increased million over the prior year 
this is due to increased amortization related to unproved property additions both offshore and onshore  including an increase in our canadian additions 
general and administrative expense increased by million in this increase is primarily due to increased stock compensation expense relating to performance share awards  increased professional services fees and higher employee related expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in miscellaneous expenses  primarily due to the reversal of the reserve attributable to litigation that was settled in the period 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million 
interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility was higher in the current year due to higher average borrowings 
average borrowings based on month end balances for the year were approximately million compared to approximately million in the prior year 
in addition  the effective interest rate on the credit facility increased to during from during the prior year 
partially offsetting this was an increase in interest income on our short term investments 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million due to an increase in our pre tax net income 
and compared we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased by million compared to the prior year  from million to million 
the increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from to related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of million related to the loss in of a reversionary interest in the kurten field 
in addition  the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices

however  the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 
other operating revenues other operating revenues decreased million 
this change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december  operating expenses total costs and expenses from operations decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows brokered natural gas cost decreased million 
for additional information related to this decrease see the analysis performed for brokered natural gas revenue and cost 
exploration expense decreased million primarily as a result of higher dry hole expense in during  we drilled dry exploratory wells compared to in the corresponding period of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased  as anticipated  by approximately or million 
the increase was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in south louisiana in  which increased the per mcfe dd a rate in impairment of oil and gas properties expense decreased million 
this decrease is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million incurred in related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the kurten field 
effective february   the kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner s election 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
based on the receipt of the appraisal in february  we determined that we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field  we performed an impairment review which resulted in an million charge 
general and administrative expense increased million from to stock compensation expense increased by million as a result of performance share awards issued in and increased amortization of restricted stock grants for grants which occurred during the year 
compliance fees related to sarbanes oxley increased expenses by million  and there was a million increase in employee related expenses 
taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher commodity prices realized during the year as compared to the prior year 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense decreased million 
this variance is due to a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in prime rates 
average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were million in which is a decrease from million in our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million due to an increase in our pre tax net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
under our revolving credit agreement  the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges 
at december   we had nine cash flow hedges open eight natural gas price collar arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement 
at december   a million million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income  along with a million short term derivative liability and a million short term derivative receivable  which is shown in other current assets on the balance sheet 
the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges  and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate 
assuming no change in commodity prices  after december  we would expect to reclassify to the statement of operations  over the next months  million in after tax charges associated with commodity hedges 
this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december  related to anticipated production 
hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
during  natural gas price swaps covered  mmcf  or of our gas production  fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of per mcf 
at december   we had no open natural gas price swap contracts covering production 
from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date 
at december   we did not have any of these types of arrangements 

table of contents hedges on production options from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under the collar arrangements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index price falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
during  natural gas price collars covered  mmcf of our gas production  or of our gas production with a weighted average floor of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of per mcf 
during  an oil price collar covered mbbl of our crude oil production  or of our crude oil production with a weighted average floor of per mbbl and a weighted average ceiling of per mbbl 
at december   we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our production as follows natural gas price collars contract period volume in mmcf weighted average ceiling floor net unrealized loss in thousands as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year at december   we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our production as follows crude oil price collar contract period volume in mbbl weighted average ceiling floor net unrealized loss in thousands as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged
