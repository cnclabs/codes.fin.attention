financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december   and  we operated primarily in the united states 
we derived  of our revenues from foreign operations during the year ended december  we had no material foreign operations in and employees as of december   we had approximately employees  including hourly rate employees 
the number of hourly rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time 
we have no unionized employees and believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
electrical construction the company  through its subsidiary southeast power corporation southeast power  is engaged in the construction and maintenance of electrical facilities for utilities and industrial customers 
the company also installs fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
the company has primarily performed work in the southeastern united states 
in the beginning of  the company established a new electrical construction division in south carolina to expand its presence into the mid atlantic region of the united states 
the company s electrical construction business includes the construction of transmission lines  distribution systems and substations and other electrical installation services for utility systems and industrial and specialty projects  including fiber optic cable installation which is primarily overhead optical ground wire and all dielectric self supporting cable 
our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve 
representative customers include florida power light company georgia power company lee county electric cooperative hypower inc santee cooper municipal electric authority of georgia a significant portion of our revenue comes from two or three different customers each year 
the largest customers may change from year to year 
in the year ended december   florida power light company and santee cooper each accounted for more than of consolidated revenue 
since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year  we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer 
it is the company s policy to commit itself only to the amount of work it believes it can properly supervise  equip and complete to the customer s satisfaction and schedule 
as a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects undertaken by the company  a substantial portion of the company s annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  the specific identity of which vary from year to year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers which exceed of total sales 
construction is customarily performed pursuant to the plans and specifications of customers 
the company generally supplies the management  labor  equipment and tools while materials are primarily supplied by the customers 
most projects have a duration of six months or less  although  some contracts may extend beyond one year 
revenues and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  customer spending patterns and system loads 
the company primarily performs work in the southeastern united states 
electric utility customers normally perform their system upgrades and maintenance work during off peak seasons when the demand for electrical power is reduced  which is in the first two quarters of the year in the southeast region of the united states 
this pattern is apparent by the reduction in the number of active projects in the third quarter 
however  since hurricane season normally peaks during this period  this pattern can be offset with storm restoration work resulting from hurricane damage 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive 
the company competes with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
the company also faces competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
competitive factors include level of technical expertise and experience  industry reputation  quality of work  price  geographic presence  dependability  availability of skilled personnel  worker safety  and financial stability 
the company s management believes that the company competes favorably with its competitors on the basis of these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to the company s services  or that the company will be able to maintain or enhance its competitive position 
the company enters into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding or direct negotiations with its customers 
competitively bid contracts account for a majority of the company s electrical construction revenues 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken  such contracts typically involve lump sum fixed price  or unit price time and material contracts 
however  many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
the magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by the company vary  which may result in substantial fluctuations in its backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
the projected backlog amounts for these service agreement contracts are based on our historical work from these customers 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
our backlog at december  was   of which is believed to be firm due to the nature of our fixed priced contracts and expected to be completed within the current year and  of which is attributable to service agreements  with  reasonably expected to be completed within the current year and  reasonably expected to be completed during calendar year ending december  in total  we expect to complete approximately of the december  backlog during calendar year this compares to a december  backlog of  of which  was believed to be firm from fixed price contracts and expected to be completed within calendar year  and  of which was attributable to service agreements expected to be completed within calendar year backlog at january  was approximately  with  believed to be firm from fixed price contracts and  from service agreements  with all backlog attributable to fixed price contracts expected to be completed by year end december  backlog at january   was approximately  with  believed to be firm from fixed price contracts and  from service agreements 
in certain circumstances  the company is required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety to secure its contractual commitments 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
management is not aware of any performance bonds issued for the company that have ever been called by a customer 
we currently believe that we will not have to fund any claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
the company believes that it has adequate bonding availability 
as of december   outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of the company s electrical construction subsidiary amounted to approximately  generally  our customers supply most or all of the materials required for a particular contract and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment to perform the installation services 
however  with respect to a portion of our contracts  we may supply part or all of the materials required 
in these instances  we are not dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete the job 
we are not presently experiencing  nor do we anticipate experiencing  any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials 
the company is subject to various federal  state and local statutes and rules regarding  among other things  contractor licensing  electrical codes  worker safety and environmental protection 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
the main administrative and maintenance facilities of southeast power are located on a acre tract of land near titusville  florida  which is owned by the company 
the office building is approximately  square feet 
the shop and maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the south carolina division of southeast power owns its administrative and maintenance facilities  which are located on a acre tract of land in spartanburg  south carolina 
the company purchased the one acre parcel of land previously leased  increasing total acreage from to acres during the office building is approximately  square feet and the maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the company believes that the aforementioned properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained 
real estate the primary focus of the company s real estate operations is on the development of residential condominium projects 
to date  the company has purchased five sites on the east coast of central florida 
the company has developed  or plans to develop  condominium complexes on all of these sites 
the company has sold all of the condominiums in the first three projects  oak park  the fourth project  is in the final stages of construction  and pineapple house  the fifth project  began construction during the fourth quarter of oak park is a forty unit townhouse style condominium project located in cape canaveral  florida and pineapple house  the first phase of a multi phase development  is comprised of an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida 
the company acquires land only after feasibility and environmental testing has been performed 
generally  architectural plans for the projects are outsourced and the project plans are submitted to general building contractors for competitive fixed price bids 
in an effort to limit risk  the company s policy is to obtain a substantial number of contracts for sale  backed by customers non refundable earnest money deposits  prior to commencing construction on the condominium projects 
the sales process is conducted by outside real estate agents 
as of december   the real estate operation s backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method was approximately  compared to approximately  as of december  we expect to complete and deliver of our backlog at december  to our buyers during the year ended december  and the balance during the year ended december  our backlog at january  was approximately  compared to  for the same period last year 
there can be no assurance that settlements of condominiums subject to contracts for sale will occur 
the company generally purchases land and pays for architectural  engineering and various other costs with cash reserves 
construction costs are generally financed with bank financing  as specified in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not offer financing arrangements to purchasers of its condominiums  however  the company requires minimum deposits of which are held in escrow by a third party until such time when the units are closed and title to the units has been transferred to the buyers 
the real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with numerous national and local real estate developers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors  including quality  location  design  perceived value  price and reputation in the marketplace 
competitive advantages of the company include desirable locations  attractive designs and higher quality features not generally offered by other developers in the market in which we compete 
our revenues and results of operations in real estate can be subject to fluctuations 
factors expected to contribute to this variability include the timing of the start of construction of new projects  our ability to continue to acquire land on acceptable terms  the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction  the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in florida  prevailing interest rates and the availability of financing  weather conditions  and the cost and availability of materials and labor 
our historical financial performance in our real estate construction is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in particular  we expect financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter to quarter 
our revenue may therefore fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company is subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations regarding  among other things  zoning  building permits  environmental standards  building moratoriums and building codes 
permits and approvals mandated by regulation for development of any magnitude are often numerous  significantly time consuming and onerous to obtain  and not guaranteed 
the company believes that its real estate operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations 
however  the company s growth and development opportunities may be limited and more costly as a result of such regulatory requirements 
the real estate division administrative offices are located within the corporate offices located in melbourne  florida 
discontinued operations effective november   the company completed the sale of the capital stock of its mining subsidiaries  st 
cloud mining company and the goldfield consolidated mines company  to an unrelated party as detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company was notified by the united states environmental protection agency the epa that it is a potentially responsible party prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at the anderson calhoun mine mill site the site in stevens county  washington which was previously owned by the company see item  legal proceedings 
in november  the company learned that in october  the state of washington  as part of its effort to catalog abandoned mines  issued a report on the sierra zinc mine mill site the sierra site  also in stevens county  washington  which may have been owned or operated by the company  and which may have been used by the company to process a limited amount of ore from the site 
the report did not address any potential required remediation or reclamation  and an investigation by the epa of the sierra site determined that further action was not recommended 
although the company is not aware of any threatened governmental or other action with respect to the sierra site  there can be no assurance that such action will not occur in the future 
item a 
risk factors 
our business involves various risks associated with the operations of our company 
to provide a framework to understand our operating environment  we are providing a brief explanation of the significant risks associated with our business 
although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors  others could emerge in the future 
each of the following risks could affect our performance 
risks related to our electrical construction operations we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small group of customers 
the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenues 
a significant portion of our electrical construction revenue is derived from a small group of customers  with two or three different customers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year 
for example  in the year ended december   two of our customers accounted for greater than of our consolidated revenue  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
the loss of one or more of these customers would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenues  margins and profits which could be material 
the electrical construction industry is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our financial performance could be harmed 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 
if we fail to compete favorably with new or existing competitors  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our business is affected by the spending patterns of our customers and adverse weather conditions  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations can be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  including inclement weather due to tropical storms and hurricanes  which are most likely to occur in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
any weather related delays in the completion of  or which increase the cost of  our projects could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in any one or more of our reporting periods 
an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could reduce the demand for our services 
because a substantial portion of our electrical construction work is performed for customers in the electric utility industry  an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could impair the financial condition of many of our customers  which could cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our services  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
skilled labor shortages and increased labor costs could negatively affect our ability to compete for new projects 
in our electrical construction business  we have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel 
for example  currently there is a shortage of linemen capable of working on and supervising the construction of high voltage lines 
linemen are frequently recruited across geographic regions to satisfy demand  including for storm restoration work  which can exacerbate this shortage 
the commencement of new  large scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements as well as the aging utility workforce further depletes the pool of skilled labor available to us  even if we are not awarded such projects 
as a result of these factors  the supply of experienced linemen and supervisors may not be sufficient to meet our expected demand and we may not be able to allocate or hire sufficient project managers for new electrical construction projects 
if we were unable to retain sufficient qualified personnel at a reasonable cost  or at all  we would be unable to staff new and existing projects  which would reduce our revenues 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  a significant portion of our revenues in our electrical construction operations is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost method  which is standard for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in revenue or translate into profits 
our backlog for our electrical construction operations at january  was  which represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
this revenue is not guaranteed  however  as many of our customers may cancel their contracts with us on short notice  typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
in addition   of these uncompleted contracts are service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
typically  these service agreements do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
for these service agreements  we project the backlog amount based on our historical work from each customer 
to the extent that our customers cancel their contracts with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason  we will not realize any revenue or profit from the associated backlog 
furthermore  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
as a result  even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our backlog  if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our projects are subject to numerous hazards 
if we do not maintain an adequate safety record  we may be ineligible to bid on certain projects  could be terminated from existing projects and could have difficulty procuring adequate insurance 
hazards experienced as a result of our electric construction operations include electrocutions  fires  mechanical failure and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause and have caused personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages  including blackouts  and may result in suspension of our operations on a project  large damage claims  and  in extreme cases  criminal liability 
at any given time  we are subject to workers compensation claims and claims by employees  customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries resulting from such hazards or other workplace accidents 
further  regulatory changes implemented by the occupational safety and health administration could impose additional costs on us 
notwithstanding our investment of substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and we may be unable to avoid accidents resulting from the hazards described above and the associated liability exposure  which may be significant 
furthermore  if serious accidents or fatalities were to occur or if our safety record were to deteriorate  we could become ineligible to bid on certain projects and could be terminated from existing projects  our reputation and our prospects for future projects could be negatively affected  and we could be required to expend additional resources on health and safety programs 
in addition  if our safety record were to significantly deteriorate  it would become more difficult and expensive for us to procure adequate insurance  if we are able to procure insurance at all 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
in certain circumstances  the company is required to provide performance bonds to secure its contractual commitments 
although to date we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding  if we were unable to obtain surety bonds in the future  or were required to post collateral in order to obtain surety bonds  our ability to obtain new contracts would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our real estate development operations we engage in real estate activities which are speculative and involve a high degree of risk the real estate industry is highly cyclical by nature and future market conditions are uncertain 
factors which adversely affect the real estate and homebuilding industries  many of which are beyond our control  include the availability and cost of financing  unfavorable interest rates and increases in inflation  overbuilding or decreases in demand  changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  cost overruns  inclement weather  and labor and material shortages  the impact of present or future environmental legislation  zoning laws and other regulations  availability  delays and costs associated with obtaining permits  approvals or licenses necessary to develop property  and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
an adverse change in economic conditions could reduce the demand for condominiums and  as a result  could reduce our earnings 
changes in national and regional economic conditions  as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our real estate development operations and where prospective purchasers of our condominiums live  can have a negative impact on our business 
adverse changes in employment levels  job growth  consumer confidence  interest rates and population growth may reduce demand and depress prices for our condominiums 
this  in turn  can reduce our earnings 
the multifamily housing industry is highly competitive and  if others are more successful  our business could decline 
we operate in a very competitive environment  which is characterized by competition from a number of other real estate developers 
we compete with large national and regional development companies and with smaller local firms for land  financing  raw materials and skilled management and labor resources 
we also compete with the resale  or previously owned  condominium market 
increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and or reduce our prices 
increased competition could also result in an oversupply of condominiums or other housing alternatives available for sale  which could depress the prices at which we can sell our condominiums  and increase the length of time it takes us to sell them 
if a failure to compete effectively resulted in our selling fewer condominiums at lower prices  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if land is not available at reasonable prices  our sales and earnings could decrease 
our real estate development operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential condominiums 
changes in the general availability of land  competition for available land  availability of financing to acquire land  zoning regulations that limit housing density and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential developments 
if the supply of land appropriate for development of our residential condominiums becomes more limited because of these factors  or for any other reason  the cost of land could increase  which could reduce the profitability of our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums  and the number of condominiums that we build and sell could be reduced  which would reduce our revenues 
if the market value of our land and developments drops significantly  our profits could decrease 
the market value of our land and condominium inventories of our real estate development operations depends on market conditions 
we acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current market 
if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory  we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past  may experience less than anticipated profits and may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our property or finished product 
in the face of adverse market conditions  we may have substantial inventory carrying costs or may have to sell land or completed units at a loss  which would have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  if there is a decrease in demand for condominiums such that the market value of a condominium is less than purchase price reduced by the deposit made by a buyer  the buyer may elect to forfeit their deposit to the company and have no further obligation to purchase the condominium resulting in a loss of revenue  operating income and a possible write down of condominiums in inventory 
government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our developments  increase our expenses or limit our building activities  which could have a negative impact on our operations 
we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our real estate development operations  and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority 
we incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs  as discussed below 
various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning building  zoning  sales and similar matters apply to and or affect the residential multifamily industry 
municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities  such as water and sewer taps 
in some areas  municipalities may enact growth control initiatives  which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year 
this governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities  mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers 
the industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations which limit the availability or use of land 
we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law 
further  we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed developments  whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties 
increases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs  and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for our condominiums 
increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space  road improvements  or to provide low and moderate income housing  could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums 
in addition  increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide  as a result  not to purchase one of our condominiums 
in addition  any changes in the income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing  which in turn could reduce our sales and adversely affect our revenues 
our business is concentrated in florida  which increases our exposure to local adverse events 
in our real estate development operations  we currently develop and sell condominiums only on the east coast of the state of florida 
as a consequence  our exposure to local adverse events  such as natural disasters or changes in economic conditions  is increased 
in particular  the state of florida is affected by tropical storms and hurricanes  which can damage or destroy buildings  including condominiums 
the occurrence of such a storm or other natural disaster could result in delays in construction and shortages and increased costs of labor and building materials 
any such delays or additional costs could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development operations 
additionally  a number of insurance carriers have opted either not to write insurance in florida at all or to only renew existing policies and not to write new policies 
these practices have resulted in substantial increases in the cost of insurance  a widespread shortage of available private insurance for property owners in the state of florida and the creation of a state joint underwriting association 
the state provided insurance coverages generally afford less protection at greater costs than typically provided by private insurance carriers 
the inability of property owners to obtain cost effective insurance could have an adverse effect on demand for property in our markets  which could reduce our revenues 
furthermore  there are periods of time during which insurance companies will not write policies because of the presence of a named storm that may pass over the areas in which we sell condominiums 
during these periods  home closings in areas that could be affected by such a storm will be delayed until the risk of the storm has passed and the required insurance can be obtained 
adverse weather conditions and conditions in nature beyond our control could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
in our real estate development operations  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  floods and fires  can have serious effects on our ability to perform work 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems 
any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in the completion of  or increase the cost of  our projects and  as a result  could adversely affect our sales  earnings and profitability 
if we experience shortages of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control  there could be delays or increased costs in developing our condominiums  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to develop residential condominiums may be affected by circumstances beyond our control  including work stoppages  labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people  such as carpenters  roofers  electricians and plumbers  lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services  our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured  and shortages  or delays in availability  or fluctuations in prices of  building materials 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our condominium projects 
if we are not able to recover these increased costs by raising the prices of our condominiums we might decide to postpone or cancel the development of condominium projects on which we have not yet begun construction 
if that happens  our operating results could be harmed 
additionally  we may be limited in the amount we can raise sales prices by our customers unwillingness to pay higher prices 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly  which could adversely affect our business 
as a real estate developer  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims  which can include bodily injury claims and mold related property damage claims among others  are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high  and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims  we may experience losses that could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition  which could be material 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of our projects 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our costs would increase and our revenues would decrease  or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels 
increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business  which would have an adverse affect on our profitability 
if our potential customers are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations also depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our condominiums 
increases in the cost of home mortgage financing could prevent our potential customers from purchasing our condominiums 
in addition  where our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a condominium from us  increases in mortgage costs could prevent the buyers of our customers existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete the purchase  which could result in our potential customers inability to buy a condominium from us 
if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing  our sales and revenues could decline 
we depend upon the availability and skill of general contractors and subcontractors 
substantially all of our construction work is done by subcontractors working for a general contractor we select for a particular project 
accordingly  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of those subcontractors 
we do not have long term contractual commitments with any particular general contractor  subcontractors or suppliers 
although we believe that our relationships with our general contractors  subcontractors and suppliers are good  we cannot assure you that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available to us at reasonable rates 
the inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver condominiums and could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our real estate development operations 
additionally  if there is an impairment  bankruptcy or default by the general contractor or subcontractors our production  revenue and operating income may be adversely affected 
we rely on outside professionals whose errors could increase our costs 
we often collaborate with numerous professionals such as architects  engineers and general contractors in the development of our real estate projects 
in the course of our business  we rely on the work of these professionals to help design and build the condominiums that we develop  and errors in their work can create significant increases in cost and delays in construction 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenues and operating results from real estate development operations are subject to fluctuations 
because we typically have only one or two projects under development at any time  factors such as the timing of the start of construction of new projects  the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction and others can cause our revenues and operating results to vary from period to period and from year to year 
accordingly  the historical financial performance of our real estate development operations is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results for any particular period  and quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
we may be subject to environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our properties 
the development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on our part as owner and developer  for our own acts as well as the acts of prior owners or owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of our properties  we may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
should a substantial environmental hazard be found on any of our properties  our results of operations and the value of the contaminated property could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business we could be adversely affected by the loss of key management personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the efforts of our senior management  including those of our subsidiaries 
we believe that key members of our senior management possess valuable industry knowledge  relationships and experience that are important to the successful operation of our business

item legal proceedings 
environmental on september   the united states environmental protection agency the epa issued a special notice letter notifying the company that it is a potentially responsible party prp  along with three other parties  with respect to investigation and removal activities at the anderson calhoun mine mill site the site in stevens county  washington  which the epa may request that the company  along with the other prps  perform or finance 
specifically  the epa has requested that the company and three other prps undertake  perform  and finance an engineering evaluation and cost analysis or ee ca for the site 
the ee ca study is in progress as described below 
the primary purpose of an ee ca is to determine the nature and scope of contamination  evaluate risks  and identify and evaluate a range of possible clean up alternatives 
the epa retains the sole discretion to determine what  if any  clean up will ultimately be required based on the ee ca 
the company sold the site property in the company has investigated the historic operations that occurred at the site as well as the nature and scope of environmental conditions at the site that may present concerns to the epa 
based upon its investigation to date  the company has determined that its operations at the site were primarily exploratory and that the company never engaged in any milling or other processing activities at the site 
the company s records reflect that between the years and it extracted a limited amount  tons of surface ore from the site for off site processing 
the site has changed owners several times since it was sold by the company  and the company believes that a substantial majority of the mining activities and all of the milling and related processing and process waste disposal activities likely were conducted by subsequent owners 
the company has entered into a cost sharing agreement with two other prps combustion engineering and blue tee corp 
collectively  the work group through which the work group has agreed how to perform and finance the ee ca 
pursuant to the cost sharing agreement  the work group has agreed to share equally the costs of the ee ca  subject to re allocation of such costs among the work group after completion of the ee ca 
the work group has also entered into an administrative order on consent aoc with the epa  wherein the work group members have agreed to perform and finance the ee ca 
field work has been completed and a partial draft ee ca report addressing the characterization of environmental conditions at the site has been submitted to the epa 
the company expects that during the spring or early summer of  the work group will develop and obtain approval for the final ee ca report and the epa will decide whether additional response action remediation may be necessary at the site and  if so  would expect that such action be taken during the or under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  any of the prps may be jointly and severally liable to the epa for the full amount of any response costs incurred by the epa  including costs related to investigation and remediation  subject to a right of contribution from other prps 
in practice  prps generally agree to perform such response activities  and negotiate among themselves to determine their respective contributions to any such multi party activities based upon equitable allocation factors  including their respective contributions to the alleged contamination and their ability to pay 
it is impossible at this stage to estimate the total costs of investigation and remediation at the site due to various factors  including incomplete information regarding the site and the other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of contamination and the company s share  if any  of liability for the contamination  the epa s future selection of clean up standards for the site  and  ultimately  the epa s selection of a preferred clean up remedy

 environmental remediation liabilities  the company recognized a provision of  within discontinued operations for this matter 
in addition  this provision was increased by  during the twelve month period ended december  and  during the twelve month period ended december   increasing the total provision to  which represents the current estimate of the company s share of the costs associated with an emergency removal action previously undertaken by the epa  the anticipated cost of the ee ca study and the anticipated professional fees associated with the ee ca study 
total actual costs to be incurred at the site in future periods may vary from this estimate  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental costs 
as of december   the company incurred actual investigation and professional service costs of  and its reserve balance for the ee ca study process  future ee ca oversight costs and estimated epa response costs is  accrued as a current liability within discontinued operations 
the accrual will be reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  which could result in changes to its amount 
the epa has indicated that it has made no determination whether any additional response action remediation will be required at the site and will not do so until after completion of the ee ca process 
at this stage  the company does not have sufficient information to determine the potential extent and nature of any necessary future response action remediation at the site  or to estimate the potential additional future cost of such action or the company s potential liability for such costs 
one of the company s former general liability insurance carriers has accepted the defense of this matter and has agreed to pay costs of defense incurred to date  all subject to certain reservation of rights as to coverage 
the company cannot predict the extent to which its costs will ultimately be covered by insurance

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the company  through its subsidiary southeast power corporation  is engaged in the construction and maintenance of electrical facilities for utilities and industrial customers 
the company also installs fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
the company is also involved in the development of residential condominium projects 
to date  the company has purchased five sites on the east coast of central florida  on all of which the company has developed or is in the process of developing condominium complexes 
the company has completed development on three of the sites which were subsequently sold and the remaining two sites are currently under construction 
overview revenue from electrical construction operations remained relatively constant for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
however  electrical construction operating margins were stronger  increasing approximately  in in large part due to the completion in of a transmission project that experienced a significant loss and reduced operation costs as a result of improved management  enhanced safety initiatives and the continued investment in our fleet vehicles 
revenues from our real estate development operations increased by approximately for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase is mainly the result of the current condominium project under development being significantly larger than the condominium project under development in the like period of operating margins from real estate development operations vary due to the type and number of units under construction at any given time 
since we historically have had only one or two projects under construction at any given time  operating margins can vary significantly depending upon the cost of the underlying land  the type of construction  location of the project and general market conditions 
in addition  our projects are generally completed in approximately one year  which also influences year to year operating margin comparisons 
operating margins increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a lower land and construction cost per unit for the project under construction in when compared to the project under construction in coupled with a stronger real estate market 
although it is impossible to quantify the precise effect of each of these factors  we believe that the margin improvement in was largely attributable to lower land cost and improved market conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects  deferred income tax assets and environmental remediation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management has discussed the selection and development of its critical accounting policies  estimates and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion electrical construction segment the company recognizes revenue from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using primarily the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in productivity and scheduling  and the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and our detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects  we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
contract loss accruals recorded for the twelve and three month periods ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve and three month periods ended december  revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
percentage of completion real estate development segment our initial condominium project was accounted for under the deposit method due to our limited experience in condominium development business 
accordingly  the recognition of related revenue and expenses was deferred until the project was complete and the underlying titles were transferred to the buyers 
as of august  commencing with our second condominium development project  all revenue associated with real estate development projects that meet the criteria specified by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  a substantial percentage at least one third of the condominiums are under firm  non refundable contracts  except in the case of non delivery of the unit or interest  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  after considering the requirements of applicable state laws  the condominium contract  and the terms of applicable financing agreements  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured  deposits equal or exceed of the contract price  and sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company determines that construction is beyond a preliminary stage when engineering and design work  execution of construction contracts  site clearance and preparation  excavation  and the building foundation are complete 
the company believes that a material difference in total actual project costs versus total estimated project costs is unlikely due to the nature of the fixed price construction contracts we enter into with the general contractors on our real estate projects 
if a current estimate of total project costs indicates a loss on a project  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
there were no contract loss accruals recorded during any period in  and in the real estate development segment 
the timing of revenue and expense recognition is contingent on construction productivity 
factors possibly impeding construction productivity include  but are not limited to  supply of labor  materials and equipment  scheduling  weather  permitting and unforeseen events 
if a buyer were to default on the contract for sale  revenues and expenses recognized in prior periods would be adjusted in the period of default 
deferred tax assets the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company were to subsequently determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   our deferred tax assets were largely comprised of a net operating loss nol carryforward which will expire in and an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based on historical experience and assumptions with respect to forecasts of future taxable income and tax planning  among others  the company anticipates being able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the nol carryforward prior to its expiration date and the amt credit carryforward which has no expiration date 
therefore  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
the minimum amount of future taxable income required to be generated to fully realize the deferred tax assets is approximately  provision for remediation in september  the company was notified by the united states environmental protection agency the epa that it is a potentially responsible party prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at a mine that it had formerly owned

 environmental remediation liabilities  the company recognized a provision of  within discontinued operations for this matter  which was increased by  during the twelve month period ended december  and  during the twelve month period ended december   increasing the total provision to  total actual remediation costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from this estimate  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental costs 
the company expects that during the spring or early summer of  the work group will develop and obtain approval for the final ee ca report and the epa will decide whether additional response action remediation may be necessary at the site and  if so  the company would expect that such action would be taken during or results of operations segment information year ended december  compared to year ended december  the table below is a reconciliation of the company s operating income attributable to each of its segments for the two year period ended december as indicated electrical construction revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold depreciation sg a provision for doubtful accounts other general expenses total operating expenses operating income real estate development revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold depreciation sg a other general expenses total operating expenses operating income operating income is total operating revenue less operating expenses inclusive of depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses for each segment

continuing operations revenues total revenues in the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  in the year ended december  this increase in total revenues was mainly due to the increased revenue recognized in real estate construction activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in electrical construction revenue remained relatively unchanged at  for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in the company s backlog from time to time 
at december  the approximate value of uncompleted contracts was  compared to  at december  we expect to complete approximately of this backlog during the year ended december  our electrical construction backlog at january  was approximately  we cannot project the levels of future demand for construction services 
real estate construction revenues increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  was mainly due to the development of oak park  which is a significantly larger project than the project we had under development during the same period last year 
also contributing to the difference is the current project being approximately complete as of december   with a like percentage of project revenue recognized in the year ended december   whereas  the previous project was completed by june  with approximately of its revenue recognized during the same period last year 
as of december   the real estate operation s backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method was approximately  compared to approximately  as of december  we expect to complete and deliver of our backlog at december  to our buyers during the year ended december  and the balance during the year ended december  our real estate development backlog at january  was approximately  there can be no assurance that settlements of condominiums subject to contracts for sale will occur 
the company s fifth project  pineapple house  began construction during the last quarter of the company will not begin recognizing revenue  however  until construction is beyond a preliminary stage  as described above 
operating results electrical construction operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  during the year ended december   an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  operating margins on electrical construction operations increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the operating margin was primarily a result of the completion in of a transmission project which experienced a loss of approximately  caused by unforeseen operational difficulties approximately of the increased margin  a reduction in subcontract costs approximately and the utilization of company owned equipment versus rental equipment which resulted from the recent purchase of capital equipment approximately 
the  loss on a transmission project in was primarily attributable to delays caused by a shortage of qualified personnel  requiring additional complete crew units to be allocated to the project to meet the construction schedule required by the customer  accounting for approximately of the loss  and the unavailability of specialized company owned equipment allocated to the project  due to breakdowns 
the breakdowns increased the time required to complete the project  causing higher than expected rental costs and equipment maintenance charges  accounting for approximately of the loss 
real estate development operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of  in the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was principally the result of a significantly larger project under development during approximately million than the project under development during the same period last year million and the percentage completed during compared to the project under development during the same period last year 
operating margins  as a percentage of revenue  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a lower land and construction cost per unit for the project under construction in when compared to the project under construction in coupled with a stronger real estate market 
although it is impossible to quantify the precise effect of each of these factors  we believe that the margin improvement in was largely attributable to lower land cost and improved market conditions

liquidity and capital resources working capital analysis our primary cash needs have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our lines of credit 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  we anticipate that this cash on hand  our credit facilities and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs and debt requirements  as well as to ensure our ability to grow 
cash flow analysis the following table presents our net cash flows for each of the years ended december as indicated net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities compared to cash used by our operating activities totaled  in the year ended december   compared to cash provided of  from operating activities for the same period in our cash flows are influenced by the level of operations  operating margins  the types of services we provide  as well as the stages of our projects in both the electrical construction and real estate segments 
net cash used in operating activities in the year ended december  was primarily related to the change in contracts receivable for the real estate segment  which used cash of  when compared to cash provided of  for the same period in this can be attributed to the current project under construction being only complete all contracts receivable from the project remain uncollected until the project is complete  compared to the project under construction for being complete 
operating cash flows normally fluctuate relative to the status of development of the real estate projects 
in addition  the change in accounts receivable and accrued billings in the electrical construction segment for the year ended december  used cash of  compared to cash provided of  for the same period in this increase in cash used was mainly due to the outstanding balance in accounts receivable of one major customer whose payment terms exceed our normal day terms  accounting for of the total accounts receivable balance and approximately of the increase in cash used in these accounts
