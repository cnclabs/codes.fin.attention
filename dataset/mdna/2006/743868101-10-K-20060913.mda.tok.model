the corporation s actual results  performance  or achievements may differ materially from those suggested  expressed  or implied by forward looking statements due to a wide range of factors including  but not limited to  the credit risks of lending activities  including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan lo sses  the corporation s ability to access cost effective funding  the general business environment  the direction of future interest rates and the corporation s ability to successfully manage the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates  the california real estate market  competitive conditions between banks and non bank financial services providers  regulatory changes  labor market competitiveness  and other risks detailed in the corporation s reports filed with the sec 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting i sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be estimated  and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which require that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance has three components i a formula allowance for groups of homogeneous loans  ii a specific valuation allowance for identified problem loans and iii an unallocated allowance 
each of these components is based upon estimates that can change over time 
the formula allowance is based primarily on historical experience and as a result can differ from actual losses incurred in the future 
the history is reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made as needed 
various techniques are used to arrive at specific loss estimates  including historical loss information  discounted cash flows and fair market value of collateral 
the use of these techniques is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further details  see comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and provision for loan losses on page of this form k 
interest is generally not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than days delinquent 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  requires that derivatives of the corporation be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the bank s derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments 
estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends 
the fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the corporation adopted the sec guidance regarding loan commitments that are recognized as derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
as a result of implementing the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments  the corporation excludes the recognition of servicing released premiums in the valuation of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale 
the corporation s previous practice had been to recognize  at the inception of the rate lock  the anticipated servicing released premiums on the underlying loans 
the corporation elected to prospectively apply this guidance to new loan commitments initiated after january  this action delays the recognition of servicing released premiums until the underlying loans are funded and sold 
executive summary and operating strategy provident savings bank  fsb established in is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid sized businesses in the inland empire region of southern california 
the bank conducts its business operations as provident bank  provident bank mortgage and through its subsidiary  provident financial corp 
the business activities of the corporation  primarily through the bank and its subsidiary  consist of community banking  mortgage banking  and to a lessor degree  investment services and real estate operations 
community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full service offices and investing those funds in single family  multi family  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  consumer and other loans 
additionally  certain fees are collected from depositors for services provided to them such as non sufficient fund fees  deposit account service charges  atm fees  ira keogh fees  safe deposit box fees  travelers check fees  and wire transfer fees  among others 
the primary source of income in community banking is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income produced by loans and investment securities  and the interest expense produced by interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
during the next three years the corporation intends to increase the community banking business by growing total assets  restructure the balance sheet by decreasing the percentage of investment secu rities to total assets and increasing the percentage of loans held for investment to total assets  decrease the concentration of single family mortgage loans within its loans held for investment  and increase the concentration of multi family  commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loans 
in addition  over time  the corporation also intends to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of checking and savings accounts 
this strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin and ultimately  coupled with the growth of the corporation  an increase in net interest income 
mortgage banking operations primarily consist of the origination and sale of mortgage loans secured by single family residences 
the primary sources of income in mortgage banking are gain on sale of loans and certain fees collected from borrowers in connection with the loan origination process 
during the next three years the corporation intends to concentrate on high margin mortgage banking products such as alt a fixed rate  alt a adjustable rate and second trust deed loans 
by doing so  the corporation believes that it can maintain its gain on sale margin at approximately the same levels experienced during the prior year 
investment services primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to our depositors 
real estate operations primarily consist of deriving net rental income from tenants that occupy the corporation s real estate held for investment 
in the foreseeable future  real estate operations will not contribute meaningful revenue as a result of the sale of the commercial office building in november each of these businesses generates a relatively small portion of the corporation s net income 
there are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the corporation  many of which are beyond the corporation s control  including changes in accounting principles and changes in regulation  among others 
the corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices such as interest rate risk management  credit risk management  operational risk management  and liquidity management 
the current economic environment presents heightened risk for the corporation primarily with respect to rising short term interest rates and an increased concern that rising real estate values are unsustainable 
rising short term interest rates have led to a flatter yield curve placing pressure on the corporation s net interest margin since the corporation s assets are generally priced at the intermediate or long end of the yield curve and interest bearing liabilities are generally priced at the short end of the yield curve 
rising real estate values may prove unsustainable which may lead to higher loan losses since the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate located within california 
significant declines in california real estate may inhibit the corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate 
commitments and derivative financial instruments the corporation conducts a portion of its operations in leased facilities under non cancelable agreements classified as operating leases see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a schedule of minimum rental payments and lease expenses under such operating leases 
for information regarding the corporation s commitments and derivative financial instruments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
off balance sheet financing arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations at june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the corporation s liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period year over to over to over in thousands or less years years years total operating lease obligations time deposits fhlb san francisco advances total the expected obligations for time deposits and fhlb san francisco advances include anticipated interest accruals based on respective contractual terms 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit  forward loan sale agreements to third parties and commitments to purchase investment securities 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition included in item of this form k 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss  in the event of non performance by the other party to these financial instruments  is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
as of june  and  these commitment s were million and million  respectively 
comparison of financial condition at june  and june  total assets decreased million  or  to billion at june  from billion at june  primarily as a result of decreases in cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  receivable from sale of loans and real estate held for investment  partly offset by an increase in loans held for investment 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  and was attributable to lower balance requirements at the corporation s correspondent bank and lower federal funds sold 
the balance of federal funds sold varies depending on loan sale settlements and or unfunded loans late in the day  which cannot be accounted for prior to borrowing deadlines 
total investment securities decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  during fiscal  a total of million of investment securities matured and million of the reduction was the result of mortgage backed securities principal payments

a total of billion of loans were sold during fiscal the pbm loan production is sold primarily servicing released  except those loans sold to fhlb san francisco under the mpf program

the outstanding balance of loans held for sale decreased to million at june  from million at june  the outstanding balance of loans held for sale is largely dependent on the timing of loan fundings and loan sales 
the receivable from sale of loans decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june   resulting from the timing difference between loan sales and loan sale settlements 
real estate held for investment decreased million  or  to  at june  from million at june   resulting from the sale of the commercial building in november the remaining real estate held for investment is approximately six acres of land located in riverside  california  which was committed for sale in march and settled in july total liabilities decreased million  or  to billion at june  from billion at june  as a result of decreases in customer deposits and borrowings 
total deposits decreased million to million at june  from million at june  although the bank continued its emphasis on expanding customer relationships  particularly in transaction accounts  increases in short term interest rates during fiscal became a catalyst for depositors to move their funds from savings accounts to time deposits to take advantage of higher yields 
transaction accounts decreased million  or  to million at june  from million  primarily in savings and money market accounts 
time deposits increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  borrowings  comprised primarily of fhlb san francisco advances  decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  fhlb san francisco advances were primarily used to supplement the funding needs of the bank  to the extent that a decrease in deposits and a decrease in investment securities did not meet loan funding requirements 
total stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  the increase in stockholders equity during fiscal was primarily attributable to earnings in fiscal  allocation of contributions to esop  the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits  partly offset by share repurchases and cash dividends to shareholders

the corporation had net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june   as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended june  the million increase in net income in fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in net interest income and non interest income  partly offset by an increase in non interest expense 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted principally from an increase in average earning assets  partly offset by a decrease in net interest margin 
the average balance of earning assets increased million  or  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the average net interest margin declined nine basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily a result of increases in the average balance and the average yield of earning assets

the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the average cost of deposits increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the average cost of deposits was the result of the increase in short term interest rates during fiscal  maturities of lower costing time deposits and the change in the deposit mix toward higher costing time deposits 
the average balance of deposits increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average cost of borrowings  primarily fhlb san francisco advances  increased basis points to i n fiscal from in fiscal the increase in fhlb san francisco advances was primarily attributable to increases in interest rates during fiscal the average maturity of fhlb san francisco advances decreased to months at june  from months at june  the average balance of fhlb san francisco advances increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal provision for loan losses 
loan loss provisions in fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily a result of lower growth of loans held for investment and a revision in the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses 
the decrease was partly offset by a higher mix of preferred loans which includes multi family  commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loans  which generally have higher loan loss provisions 
the loans held for investment increased million from billion to billion in fiscal as compared to million from million to billion in fiscal preferred loans as a percentage of loans held for investment increased to at june  from at june  total classified assets including assets designated as special mention increased by  to million at june  from million at june  the allowance for loan losses was million  or of gross loans held for investment at june  as compared to million  or of gross loans held for investment at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans at the end of fiscal was  as compared to  at the end of fiscal consistent with its current operating strategy  the corporation intends for the fastest growing segments of loans held for investment to be commercial real estate  multi family and construction loans 
these loans generally have greater risk than single family mortgage loans 
management believes that the current provision for loan losses is prudent based upon the loans held for investment composition  historic loss experience and current economic conditions 
as changes occur regarding the risk profile of the corporation s loans held for investment  management may increase or decrease the provision for loan losses 
non interest income 
total non interest income increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of real estate  an increase in loan servicing and other fees and an increase in deposit account fees  partly offset by decreases in gain on sale of loans and gain on sale of investment securities

on june   time deposits that are scheduled to mature in one year or less were million 
historically  the bank has been able to retain a significant amount of its time deposits as they mature 
management of the bank believes it has adequate resources to fund all loan commitments with deposits and fhlb san francisco advances  and that it can adjust deposit rates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments 
the bank is required to maintain specific amounts of capital pursuant to ots requirements 
under the ots prompt corrective action provisions  a minimum ratio of for the tangible capital ratio is required to be deemed other than critically undercapitalized  while a minimum of for tier core capital  for total risk based capital and for tier risk based capital is required to be deemed well capitalized 
as of june   the bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with tangible capital  core capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios of   and  respectively 
impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time as a result of inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services 
impact of new accounting pronouncements various elements of the corporation s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  as a result of the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the financial statements of the corporation 
these policies relate to the methodology for the recognition of interest income  determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of goodwill  mortgage servicing rights and real estate held for sale 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and in the section entitled recent accounting pronouncements contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it purchase high risk derivative financial instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk

qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and by selling fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
in addition  the bank maintains an investment portfolio  which is largely in us government sponsored enterprise debt securities and us government sponsored enterprise mbs with contractual maturities of up to years that reprice frequently 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to five years

interest rate risk 
the principal financial objective of the corporation s interest rate risk management function is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to the fluctuation of interest rates 
the corporation  through its alco  has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by managing the repricing mismatch between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation s assets by retaining loans with interest rates subject to periodic market adjustments 
in addition  the bank maintains a liquid investment portfolio comprised of government sponsored enterprise debt securities and mbs 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funding while utilizing fhlb san francisco advances as a secondary source of funding which can be structured with favorable interest rate risk characteristics 
as p art of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts 
using data from the bank s quarterly report to the ots  the ots produces a report for the bank that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate risk analysis received from the ots is similar to the bank s own interest rate risk model 
npv is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the calculation is intended to illustrate the change in npv that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of    and basis points with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate change 
the following table is provided by the ots and sets forth as of june  the estimated changes in npv based on the indicated interest rate environments 
the bank s balance sheet position as of june  can be summarized as follows if interest rates increase or decrease  the npv of the bank is expected to decrease  except under the basis point rate shock 
npv as percentage net npv portfolio of portfolio value sensitivity basis points bp portfolio change value assets measure change in rates value assets dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp represents the decrease increase of the estimated npv at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the npv calculated at june  base case 
calculated as the estimated npv divided by the portfolio value of total assets 
calculated as the change in the npv ratio from the base case at the indicated change in interest rates 
the following table provided by the ots  is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a basis point rate shock at june  and at a basis point rate shock at june  by regulation the bank must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv 
at june  at june  risk measure bp bp rate shock bp bp pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure bp bp tb a level of risk minimal minimal as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the respective table 
it is also possible that  as a result of an interest rate increase  the increased mortg age payments required of arm borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the bank s mortgage banking operations 
accordingly  the data presented in the tables above should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
furthermore  the npv presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the bank  nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to stockholders in the event of the liquidation of the corporation 
the bank also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the month period subsequent to any given month end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for the bank s current balance sheet  month business plan  embedded options  rate floors  periodic caps  lifetime caps  and loan  investment  deposit and borrowing cash flows  among others  and immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus or minus and basis points 
the following table describes the results of the analysis for june  and june  june  june  basis point bp change in basis point bp change in change in rates net interest income change in rates net interest income bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp for the fiscal year ended june   the bank is slightly asset sensitive 
therefore  the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period at either a basis points  basis point or a basis point scenario 
the results also project a minimal decline in net interest income over the subsequent month period at the basis point scenario 
for the fiscal year ended june   the bank was liability sensitive 
therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  the model projects a decline in net interest income over the subsequent month period  and in a falling interest rate environment  the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent month period  except in the basis point scenario where net interest income is also projected to decline 
management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable 
however  past experience has shown that immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur 
additionally  while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates  actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis 
therefore the model results that we disclose should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of our current disclosure to previous disclosures  over time  within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve
