item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunication services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications 
we offer the packet broadband voice over internet protocol  or voip  and video communications service  packet virtual office service and videophone equipment and services 
we shipped our first voip product in  launched our packet service in november  and launched the packet virtual office business service offering in march as of march   we had approximately  packet lines in service 
since fiscal  substantially all of the company s revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
during fiscal  we completed an equity financing for gross proceeds of approximately million 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately million as compared to million at march  critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above in item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize new subscriber revenue from our packet service offerings upon expiration of any applicable acceptance period has expired 
new customers may terminate their service within thirty days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
as we have been providing our packet service for a limited period of time  we have not developed sufficient history to apply a return rate and reserve against new order revenue 
accordingly  we defer new subscriber revenue for thirty days to ensure that the thirty day acceptance period has expired 
we will have sufficient history and commence recording a returns reserve in fiscal emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the packet service with the accompanying desktop terminal adapter or other customer premise equipment constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of eitf no 
 we allocate packet revenues  including activation fees  among the customer premise equipment and subscriber services 
revenues allocated to the customer premise equipment are recognized as product revenues at the end of thirty days after order placement  provided the customer does not cancel their packet service 
all other revenues are recognized as license and service revenues when the related services are provided 
we defer the cost of goods sold of products sold for which the end customer or distributor has a right of return 
the cost of the products sold is recognized  contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue  when the subscriber has accepted the service 
at the time of each revenue transaction we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are thirty to ninety days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
during fiscal and  revenues from software licensing and related arrangements were limited 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or when the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  revenue is recognized on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above in item a  risk factors 
collectibility of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march   including a reserve for disputed credit card charges 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
litigation from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we account for litigation and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
at march   liabilities related to litigation matters were not significant 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability  if any  related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
key business metrics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn average monthly subscriber line churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of lines that terminated during that period by the simple average number of lines during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of lines during the period is the number of lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first thirty days after purchasing our service 
management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as costs for advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies 
management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value 
average monthly revenue per line average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total packet revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenues year ended march  ye ar over year change to to dollar amounts in thousa nds product revenues     percentage of total revenues product revenues consist of revenues from sales of voip terminal adapters  telephones and videophones  primarily attributable to our packet service 
for fiscal  and  product revenues also included sales of voip semiconductors and other system products of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet product revenues attributable to the growth in the subscriber base compared to the prior year  partially offset by a million decrease in sales of voip semiconductors 
during fiscal  our packet lines in service increased by from approximately  at march  to approximately  at march  the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales of video and voip semiconductors as we began to focus our business on the packet service in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in packet product revenues attributable to the growth in the subscriber base compared to the prior year

prior to fiscal  our service revenues were primarily generated by nonrecurring license transactions and related maintenance revenues 
the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet service revenues attributable to the significant growth in the subscriber base  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in license and royalty revenues associated with our ip semiconductor technology and hosted ipbx product 
in addition  we began charging a regulatory recovery fee of per line effective in may and a emergency service cost recovery fee of per line effective in january these fees are recorded as service revenues 
the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet service revenues attributable to the growth in the subscriber base  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in license and maintenance revenues associated with our hosted ipbx product and ip semiconductor telephony technology 
our average monthly revenue per line  or arpu  increased to for fiscal from for the same period of fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily attributable to our implementation of regulatory recovery and emergency fees in fiscal combined with an increase in virtual office lines in service  which have higher monthly service fees 
we did not compute or analyze arpu for fiscal  as packet was an insignificant portion of our business 
churn approximated for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in churn was due to a reduction in service outages and an increase in voice quality and customer service staffing levels 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our other existing competitors as well as against potential new entrants into the voip telephone service business  in both retaining our existing subscribers and attracting new subscribers  our churn will likely increase and our business will be adversely affected 
we did not compute or analyze churn for fiscal  as packet was an insignificant portion of our business

we generally do not charge packet subscribers for the terminal adapters used to provide our service when they subscribe on our website 
we have also offered incentives to customers who purchase terminal adapters in our retail channels to offset the cost of the equipment purchased from a retailer 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 a portion of packet revenues is allocated to product revenues  but these revenues are less than the cost of the terminal adapters 
accordingly  cost of product revenues exceeds product revenues  and we expect this trend to continue 
we began shipping lower cost broadband phone gateways and we suspended purchases of dv videophones in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we expect the cost of product revenues to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an approximately million increase attributable to equipment provided and sold to packet subscribers upon commencement of service and related manufacturing  personnel  handling  overhead and shipping costs 
the increase in packet expenses was partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenues for semiconductor products due to the decrease in sales of such products during fiscal due to the end of life of these products initiated in fiscal the increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a million increase attributable to equipment provided and sold to packet subscribers upon commencement of service and related manufacturing  personnel  handling  overhead and shipping costs

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began terminating a substantial portion of our phone traffic with a new carrier and we expect this to reduce the cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues 
the increase in cost of license and service revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an increase in packet network operations headcount  third party telephony origination and termination service fees and other costs due to the significant year over year growth in packet lines in service 
the increase in cost of license and service revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a million increase in packet network operations  third party carrier service and other costs due to the year over year growth in packet lines in service 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in license and royalty costs attributable to our ip semiconductor technology  primarily attributable to video semiconductor product development efforts conducted during fiscal as the costs of developing this video semiconductor product related to a revenue generating contract  they were included in cost of license and service revenues in fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we terminated this video semiconductor development effort in connection with the license and sale of the related technology 
research and development expenses year ended march  ye ar over year change to to dollar amounts in thousa nds research and development     percentage of total revenues research and development expenses have historically consisted primarily of personnel  system prototype design  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development and engineering efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs due to additional employee and contractor headcount 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs due to additional employee and contractor headcount 
these increases were offset by decreases in depreciation  tooling and maintenance expenses

the decrease in other income  net in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  one time gain recorded in fiscal in connection with the sale of centile europe sa  partially offset by an increase in interest income of  due to higher cash balances maintained during fiscal and the receipt of escrow funds of  from a cost basis common stock investment in an entity acquired in by a third party 
benefit for income taxes year ended march  ye ar over year change to to dollar amounts in thousa nds benefit for income taxes n a percentage of total revenues we had no provisions for the fiscal years ended march   and we recorded a  benefit in fiscal  which was primarily attributable to the release of income tax reserves recorded in prior years and  attributable to an income tax refund received by one of our foreign subsidiaries 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  the weight of objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and a full valuation allowance was recorded at march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  and million in investments in marketable securities for a combined total of million 
in comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and million in investments for a combined total of million 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased million and the combined balance decreased by million during fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to million used for operating activities and million of capital expenditures  as discussed below  partially offset by million of net proceeds from financing activities 
our restricted cash balance decreased by million due to termination of an agreement requiring a letter of credit 
comparison of fiscal and cash used in operations of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of non cash depreciation and amortization  a million stock compensation charge and million of amortization of discounts and premiums on marketable securities  a million increase in inventory and a million increase other current and noncurrent assets 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in deferred cost of goods sold  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable was attributable to timing and an increase in payables for telecommunications service provider costs 
the increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities was primarily attributable to the increase in headcount in fiscal  accrued salary for a terminated executive and an increase in sales  use and other tax liabilities 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to million of purchases of fixed assets and purchases of investments of million  partially offset by million of proceeds received from sales and maturities of investments 
the purchases of fixed assets were primarily attributable to equipment required by the growth of the packet subscriber base and expenditures for implementation fees related to third party customer relationship management software 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of net proceeds received from a common stock offering completed in december  million of proceeds received from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans and million attributable to a bank overdraft due to the timing of payments 
comparison of fiscal and cash used in operations of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of non cash depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory and a million increase in deferred cost of goods sold 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to our development of the retail and distributor channels in fiscal combined with an increase in subscribers in fiscal  and the increase in inventory was primarily attributable to the growth of the packet service and ramping of production for desktop terminal adapters 
the increases in deferred cost of goods sold and deferred revenue were primarily attributable to the growth in subscribers in fiscal and the retail and distributor channels that we did not have in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was attributable to timing and an increase in payables for inventory and telecommunications service provider costs 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to million of purchases of fixed assets and purchases of investments of million  partially offset by a net million decrease in cash classified as restricted cash due to the termination of agreements requiring letters of credit and million of proceeds received from maturities of investments 
the purchases of fixed assets were primarily attributable to equipment required by the growth of the packet subscriber base and expenditures for financial application and customer relationship management software and implementation fees 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of net proceeds received from common stock offerings completed in june and october and march and million of proceeds received from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
we have sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations since fiscal that have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
management believes that current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we continually evaluate our cash needs and may pursue additional equity or debt financing in order to achieve our overall business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  at a price or terms that are acceptable to us 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
contractual obligations at march   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
at march   future minimum annual lease payments under noncancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  were as follows in thousands year ending march  total minimum payments  in april  we entered into a series of noncancelable five year capital lease agreements for office equipment bearing interest at various rates

r  share based payment  requiring all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
this standard includes two transition methods 
upon adoption  we will be required to use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective approach  the previously reported amounts are restated either to the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented to reflect the sfas no

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so or another methodology is required by the standard 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas no 
s retrospective application requirement replaces apb no s accounting changes requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income loss of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
sfas no 
also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the requirements are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  and will only impact the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital lease and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
