critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  which range from seven to years 
betterments  significant renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition  improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that management believes such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the recognition of depreciation expense requires estimates by management of the useful life of each property and improvement  as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property  including capitalized costs  to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense could be misstated 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the property 
the carrying amount of an asset would be adjusted  if necessary  to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
if the company incorrectly estimates undiscounted cash flows  impairment charges may be different 
the impact of such estimates in connection with future impairment analyses could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent revenue arising from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
percentage rents revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that this contingent revenue is only to be recognized after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
condominium sales income arising from the sales of condominium units at the lexington avenue property income on deposits received for sales of condominium units has been deferred in accordance with the deposit method of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
gains on sales of condominium units are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the company assesses  among other things  the collectibility of revenue before recognition 
if the company incorrectly assesses collectibility of revenue  net earnings and assets could be misstated 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
under the code  the company s net operating loss carryovers nols generally would be available to offset the amount of the company s reit taxable income that would otherwise be required to be distributed as dividends to its stockholders 
the company has elected to treat its wholly owned subsidiary  residential llc  as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs is subject to income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
the company s nols will not be available to offset taxable income of trs 
as of december   of the residential condominium units were sold and closed 
in connection therewith  trs recognized  of income tax expense  of which  was paid in the year ended december  trs paid no income taxes in or trs deferred income taxes  where applicable  are accounted for in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
however  deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence  including tax planning strategies and other factors 
stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars are granted at of the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for each sar is measured by the excess of the stock price at the current balance sheet date over the stock price at the previous balance sheet date 
if the stock price is lower at the current balance sheet date  previously recognized expense is reversed  but not below zero 
recently issued accounting literature on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas on its effective date did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas  using the prospective method  and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 asset retirement obligations 
fin provides clarification of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas  defined as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company 
under this standard  a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin became effective in the company s fiscal quarter ended december  upon review of its assets  the company has concluded that no asset retirement obligation exists as of december  accordingly  the adoption of fin on its effective date had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting for a change in accounting principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that i a change in the method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls  and should consolidate  a limited partnership or a similar entity

nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the company s statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity
