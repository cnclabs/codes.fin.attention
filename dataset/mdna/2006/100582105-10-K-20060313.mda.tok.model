item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations overview we deliver innovative products and services that enable mobile operators and mvnos worldwide to differentiate their offerings and increase market penetration while reducing costs 
our access management  prepaid and postpaid billing and payment solutions enable operators to address new market needs 
these solutions help our customers compete effectively by attracting and retaining additional subscriber customers  thereby increasing their ability to drive additional revenue while lowering their operating costs 
we offer our fully managed services and licensed products to wireless operators in the united states and worldwide  selling through both direct and indirect channels 
our bcgi billing product line includes our prepaid wireless product  real time billing  and our postpaid product  voyager billing 
voyager billing serves us operators and mvno s  and our revenues are earned principally on a per subscriber basis for generating a postpaid subscriber s monthly bill 
we generate revenues from our real time billing product as a managed service principally by processing prepaid wireless minutes or as a percentage of wireless customer revenue 
real time billing services revenues are recorded net of outage penalties that we may incur based on contracted service level agreements with the wireless operators 
we also generate revenues from other transactions processed  including push to talk  sms and other data services 
additionally  whether deployed on a managed service basis or licensed basis  we generate revenues from software licensing  implementations  bcgi professional services and special development services 
these revenues are typically recognized over the term of the contract for managed services customers and at the time of shipment or completion of installation for licensed sales 
while we have not generated significant bcgi access management revenues related to our mobile guardian products to date  we expect that we will generate greater future revenues from these products by charging wireless operators on a per subscriber per month basis  a per transaction basis  or on a one time subscriber license basis  plus maintenance and other services 

table of contents in the us  we typically generate revenues from bcgi payment by charging wireless operators a transaction fee for the services performed and paying the financial partners a fee for enabling the transaction 
internationally  we license technology to wireless operators to support their payment processing needs 
our net revenues decreased to million in compared to million in in  net revenues increased from million in our operating loss of million in compares to million of operating income in the decrease in operating income from to is primarily due to the accrual of million for the estimated loss from the freedom wireless litigation recorded in accordance with fas and fin  an additional million in legal costs related to the freedom wireless litigation  lower revenue from the loss of verizon and cingular subscribers  increased investment in engineering  research and development to enhance our product offerings  and investments in an international sales team and infrastructure to support our expansion into global markets 
our operating income of million in increased over million in on may   a jury determined that bcgi and the other defendants infringed or are infringing two freedom wireless patents 
the jury damages and post trial damages through october  plus interest and court costs awarded by the district court total approximately million bcgi and each carrier are jointly liable for specific amounts 
we have an obligation to indemnify the other defendants for damages they may incur with respect to any infringement by our technology 
in july  we entered into the appeal agreement with cingular wireless whereby we placed million into escrow for the purpose of using these funds as security to cingular 
in exchange for placing the funds into escrow  cingular has posted bonds totaling million to stay the execution of the judgment  pending appeal 
at december   this escrow amount including interest earned to date totaled million and is recorded as restricted cash 
on october  the district court granted the injunction to freedom wireless providing a day grace period during which we could continue to provide our services to carriers 
subsequent to the day grace period  the district court ordered that we must stop providing prepaid services to all of our real time billing customers  other than those who have a license with freedom 
we filed a motion to clarify the order or stay the injunction pending appeal which was denied by the district court 
we filed an emergency appeal to stay the injunction with the appeals court and on december  the appeals court stayed the injunction 
therefore  our carrier customers  including co defendant cingular wireless  may continue to use our real time billing service during the appeals process 
in addition  the appeals court did not require bcgi and or the other defendants to post additional security for any potential damages that may accrue during the appeals process 
in october  we filed to appeal the district court judgment with the appeals court 
our principal appeal brief is expected to be filed in march   and the appeal process is expected to continue into if our appeal is unsuccessful or if we cannot successfully manage our business during the appeal process  we may not be able to continue our ongoing operations or may need to seek protection under the u 
s 
bankruptcy code 
based on management s assessment of the potential outcomes of the case and in accordance with fas and fin  we have accrued an estimated loss of million in  excluding our legal charges which are expensed as incurred 
however  the actual loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amount accrued and could be higher than the current judgment of million  which exceeds our ability to pay 

table of contents the potential outcomes vary greatly and could include any of the following if the appeals court overturns the judgment of infringement  it could either rule that bcgi would have no liability to freedom wireless  or that the case be returned to the district court for a new trial on infringement 
if the appeals court overturns the judgment that the patents held by freedom wireless were valid or enforceable  the appeals court could either rule that bcgi would have no liability to freedom wireless  or the case could be returned to the district court for a new trial on the issue of invalidity or unenforceability 
if the appeals court rules in favor of freedom wireless  we would need to seek protection under the us bankruptcy code 
the parties could enter into a settlement agreement 
since we cannot anticipate the impact on our business due to the freedom wireless litigation  we cannot provide precise future earnings guidance  however  we anticipate that revenues and earnings will decrease for the first quarter of from the fourth quarter of these decreases are due to our expectations that customer migrations  namely verizon and cingular  will continue and accelerate in the first quarter 
additionally  we anticipate that verizon wireless and cingular wireless will each constitute less than of net revenues for the first quarter of  compared to and of revenues  respectively  for the fourth quarter of verizon wireless and cingular wireless are also anticipated to be fully migrated off of our real time billing platform by june  additionally  alltel corporation and other smaller carriers have recently stopped using our real time billing platform due to concerns regarding our viability resulting from the freedom wireless litigation 
revenue generated from these carriers collectively totaled approximately of our revenues 
in we expanded our product offerings on a global scale  both on a managed services basis and on a licensed sale basis 
this global expansion of our product offerings provides customers the ability to choose which service delivery model best suits their needs 
selling our products on a licensed sale basis is expected to result in less predictability in our future sales trends 
we plan to continue to invest in and focus on our customer and product diversification strategy which includes support of bcgi access management  bcgi payment and voyager billing products as well as expansion into new domestic and international wireless markets  including the developing mvno market

table of contents revenues real time billing our net revenues from real time billing decreased by to million in compared to million in in net revenues from real time billing increased compared to million in while the subscribers on our platform increased by  from  bringing our total subscriber base to million as of december   revenue decreased primarily because the average billed rate per minute declined by approximately for compared to the decline in our average billed rate per minute was principally due to customers with lower contractual pricing becoming a larger portion of real time billing revenues  in addition to customary volume discounts for those customers 
sprint nextel became our largest customer in and we expect revenue from sprint nextel will constitute an even larger percentage of our revenue in the net revenue increase from real time billing in compared to was due primarily to additional revenue from sprint nextel corporation  partially offset by lower revenues from verizon wireless 
the increase was also attributable to an increase in the average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month to for compared to in these increases were partially offset by an decrease in our average billed rate per minute 
our us subscriber base remained consistent with million subscribers as of december  and in future periods  we expect our prepaid subscriber base to decrease  as we anticipate that the loss of subscribers from verizon wireless  cingular wireless and alltel corporation will exceed subscriber growth from other customers 
in addition  other existing customers may decide to limit or stop using our real time billing service due to the uncertainty resulting from the freedom wireless lawsuits 
the loss of these subscribers is also expected to contribute to further overall decreases in our average billed rate per minute since customers with lower contractual pricing are expected to become a larger portion of our revenues 
as a result of these factors and despite expected off setting growth of sprint nextel corporation revenues  we expect real time billing revenues to decrease significantly in other revenues other revenues are generated from our other products and operating units  including  bcgi payment  bcgi access management and voyager billing 
our net revenues from these business and product lines increased by to million in compared to million in other net revenues also increased in compared to the increases in and are primarily due to our efforts to diversify our revenues with new products and customers 
although the technologies used in these other operating units are not implicated in the freedom wireless lawsuits  we have had difficulties selling these products in certain instances due to concerns about our viability 
we expect that these difficulties will continue and may increase at least as long as the lawsuits are pending and potentially even after 
cost of revenues cost of revenues primarily include the salaries and benefits of personnel who support our managed services network and our licensed product offerings  along with costs for maintenance  telecommunications  travel and other support costs

the increase in expense for compared to was primarily due to higher costs associated with the trial and the judgment against us 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the timing of the discovery phase which yielded greater costs in we expect to incur approximately million in the first quarter of as we continue our appeal of the freedom wireless lawsuit 
estimated loss from litigation bcgi and certain of our current or former carrier customer defendants cingular wireless  at t wireless services  cmt partners and western wireless corp 
were found by the district court to have infringed or are infringing two freedom wireless patents 
the total damages award granted by the district court was million  an amount which exceeds bcgi s ability to pay 
bcgi and each carrier are jointly liable for specific amounts 
we have filed our appeal of the judgment with the appeals court 
while we continue to believe that we do not infringe these patents  that the patents are invalid and that the size of the damages awarded bears no relationship to a reasonable royalty that bcgi or any company would have paid for a license of the patents  in light of the adverse judgment  we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred 
although the ultimate amount of such loss  if any  is not currently known  accounting guidelines under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas and fasb interpretation  reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss fin  specify that if a loss can be reasonably estimated  it should be recorded 
based on management s assessment of the potential outcomes of the case and in accordance with fas and fin  we have accrued an estimated loss of million with respect to the freedom wireless litigation 
however  the actual loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amount accrued and could be higher than the current judgment of million  which exceeds our ability to pay  depending on the outcome of the appeal 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems and software  building  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in absolute dollars as compared to was primarily due to certain capital equipment that became fully depreciated in the first half of  partially offset by intangible asset amortization from the acquisitions of puresight and airada of  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in compared to was attributable to additional telecommunication equipment and software to enhance our managed services platform as well as to further develop our licensed products 
interest income interest income increased to million in compared to million in and interest income was earned primarily from investments  which were purchased using the cash generated from operations  from the sale of our teleservices business in and from the proceeds from our public offerings 
our increase in combined cash  restricted cash and investment positions in and higher average interest rates during resulted in increased levels of interest income compared to the previous years 
if we ultimately make a cash payment relating to the freedom wireless litigation  this would likely substantially reduce our cash and investment balances and therefore reduce future interest income 
provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  compared to an income tax provision of million effective tax rate for the year ended december  the benefit recorded in the current year primarily reflects our assessment of our ability to realize the tax benefit from the ultimate loss  if any  from the freedom wireless judgment and also reflects a favorable adjustment from the completion of a routine irs audit of several tax returns 
absent any changes to our legal reserve assumptions or other matters  we expect that our effective tax rate in will be substantially below statutory tax rates 
acquisitions in november  we acquired the assets of airada networks  inc and airada networks private limited airada  a privately held provider of payment management software solutions for the wireless marketplace  for million in cash 
additional contingent cash consideration may be paid to airada based on attaining certain defined annual revenue targets and other metrics through  most of which will be accounted for as goodwill 
for  airada earned contingent consideration of  of which  was paid in and all of which was accrued in purchased accounting 
the purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to identifiable assets based on fair values as of the date of acquisition 
we determined the fair value of the assets acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer relationships  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other assumptions 
identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired technology and customer contracts and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
the results of operations of airada are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
in june  we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of puresight  inc and its israeli subsidiary  puresight ltd 
puresight  a privately held provider of advanced content recognition solutions for mobile operators  isps and enterprises 
we paid million in cash for puresight  including acquisition costs 
we determined the fair value of the assets and certain liabilities acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer contracts and relationships and non compete agreements  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other factors 
identifiable intangible assets of million consist of acquired technology  customer contracts and relationships  trademarks and non compete 
table of contents agreements and are being amortized over four to seven years 
the results of operations of puresight are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments increased to million compared to million at december   primarily due to our net loss offset by non cash adjustments  higher accounts payable and accrued expenses  an income tax refund and to a lesser extent  a lower than usual days sales outstanding 
the net cash provided by operations of million in resulted from a million net loss along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million and an estimated loss contingency recorded in the freedom wireless patent infringement lawsuit of million  decreased receivables of million caused by a decrease in our days sales outstanding from as of december  to at december  and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million 
our investing activities used million of net cash for we entered into an agreement with cingular wireless  placing million of cash into escrow which is restricted cash for security since cingular has posted the required bonds to stay the execution of judgment  pending appeal  in the freedom wireless lawsuit 
in addition  we spent approximately million for the purchase of telecommunications equipment and software to enhance our managed services platform as well as to further develop our licensed products 
internally capitalized costs were million for the year ended december  we also acquired a business for approximately million and contributed million to fund our defined benefit plan  a contribution which we intend to make every year in our second quarter 
our financing activities provided cash of  for primarily from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
since our cash balance as of december  was higher than expected due to certain working capital changes  including accrued expenses and accounts receivable  we expect that our cash position will decline and range between to million at march  subject to the outcome of the freedom wireless litigation  including license fees that may be payable  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
an adverse final judgment  license fee payable or a settlement in the freedom wireless litigation would likely when paid adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources 
depending on the amount of the adverse judgment  settlement or license fee  the negative impact to our liquidity and capital resources could be material and we may need to seek protection under the u

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  capitalized software and labor  long lived assets  goodwill and intangible asset impairment  legal expenses  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be our most critical policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts estimated loss from litigation and legal costs research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes 
table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in recognizing revenue  however  certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue  changes in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  changes in uncollectible or bad debt estimates  changes in mix  amount of international sales or delays in recognizing revenue  could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we recognize our revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and application of emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we earn revenues in various ways  depending on the type of transaction 
for our managed services business  we earn revenues in the following ways for real time billing  we earn revenues principally by processing prepaid wireless minutes or as a percentage of wireless customer revenue  net of any penalties incurred related to outages on our platform 
for voyager billing  we earn revenues principally on a per subscriber basis for generating a postpaid subscriber s monthly bill 
for payextend  we earn revenues by processing transactions on behalf of wireless operators subscribers 
each of these revenues is recognized when the service is provided 
for license fees  special projects  implementation services and bcgi professional services related to our managed services business  revenues are typically recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract with the wireless operator 
for our licensed systems sales  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of systems at the time the systems are shipped or delivered to the customer  depending on shipping and payment terms 
in the event there are acceptance terms  we defer revenue until acceptance has occurred 
in addition  certain software is licensed to distributors  who pay licensing fees to us as they sell the software to their customers 
this revenue is recognized in the month in which it is earned upon sell through to a customer 
for multiple element arrangements  we determine fair value of each undelivered element and we recognize revenue based on the residual value method 
installation revenue is deferred until the entire installation is complete 
revenues from maintenance and support and other services are based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support contract period or when the services are performed 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is based upon the amount charged when the service is sold separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for installation and other services is based upon standard pre established rates 
in addition to recording revenues net of any penalties incurred related to outages on our managed services platform and estimated amounts that may be disputed  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores or disputed amounts  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we record reserves based on the length of time the receivables are past due and on historical experience 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet their financial obligations  estimates of amounts recoverable could be adversely affected 
we believe that our allowance for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts fairly represents the potential amount of bad debt we could incur 

table of contents estimated loss from litigation and legal costs we accrue for loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas and fasb interpretation reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss fin  which specifies that if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated  it should be recorded 
furthermore  when some amount within the range appears at the time to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  that amount shall be accrued 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  however  the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued 
there can be no assurance as to whether the actual loss will be higher or lower than the amount which is accrued 
we accrue the costs of settlements  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable  otherwise  such costs are expensed as incurred 
we are expensing legal costs related to the freedom wireless lawsuit as incurred due to the lengthy and unpredictable proceedings which have made it difficult to reasonably estimate legal costs for the lawsuit 
other litigation will continue to be accounted for in accordance with our accounting policy  and generally  we develop an estimate of probable costs in consultation with our outside legal counsel who is handling the case 
there can be no assurance that our expenses will not exceed our estimates 
research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of computer software or for the deployment of assets for internal use are capitalized 
the direct labor and payroll related costs of development of computer software  primarily for coding and testing of software  are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the direct labor  travel and payroll related costs to deploy assets for internal use are capitalized until the asset is placed in service 
the capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on our anticipated use  anticipated future undiscounted net cash flows and changes in hardware and software technologies 
we also capitalize internal software development costs in accordance with financial and accounting standards board fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product shall be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of all planning  designing  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
we cease capitalization of internally developed software when the product is made available for general release to customers and thereafter  any maintenance and customer support is charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized costs and if the success of new product releases is less than we anticipate  then a write down of capitalized costs may be made which could adversely affect our results in the reporting period in which the write down occurs 
internally capitalized costs totaled million for the years ended december  and amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the solution is made available for general release and amortization of internal use costs begins when the related asset is first placed into service 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which result in an impairment review include the following 
table of contents significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when indicators of impairment exist and the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets  other than goodwill  may not be recoverable  we compare the projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  which are determined considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and solution development cycles  to their carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and the carrying value is then compared to the asset s fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each of our long lived assets could differ materially from the actual results 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fas goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each operating unit  which includes bcgi access management  bcgi payment  real time billing and voyager billing with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value for each operating unit is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model  which requires judgments to be made by management regarding estimating future cash flows  economic life and discount rates  among other assumptions 
if the carrying amount of the operating unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of that operating unit  we would evaluate any impairment loss under the next step of the impairment test 
the estimated discounted cash flows for each operating unit could differ materially from the actual results 
in november  we acquired the assets of airada and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal asset acquired was completed technology related to a payment management software solution for the wireless marketplace valued at approximately million  as well as customer contracts valued at approximately  in june  we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of puresight and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal assets acquired were completed technology related to advanced content recognition solutions for mobile operators  isps and enterprises  non compete agreements  customer contracts and relationships and trademarks valued at approximately million 
management determined the fair value of the assets acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer relationships  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other assumptions 
the valuation of completed technology was primarily based on future cash flow projections over the estimated economic life adjusted for an incremental obsolescence rate discounted to present value 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology is four to seven years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarters of our fiscal year and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
as a result of the freedom wireless lawsuit judgment discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company performed an asset impairment test for our long lived assets and goodwill as of june   september  and during the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed 
future impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents income taxes our current and deferred income taxes  and associated valuation allowances  are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with special and non recurring items 
assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes depends on several factors  including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing of income tax payments 
actual collections and payments may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances 
while we have considered the current facts and circumstances of the tax benefit from the ultimate loss  if any  relating to the freedom wireless judgment in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased in the future to cover deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement no 
however  statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we are adopting statement no 
r on january  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore will not restate prior periods 
as permitted by statement no 
 in and prior  we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and our stock price at the time of grant  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
non cash expenses related to fas r for options that have been granted and that are not vested as of december  are anticipated to be immaterial in however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million   and million in  and  respectively 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted 
table of contents accounting principle 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we are currently analyzing fin and believe the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  since our investments are generally conservative in nature and are of a relatively short duration and some are held to maturity  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for either hedging foreign currency exposure risk or speculative trading purposes 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
