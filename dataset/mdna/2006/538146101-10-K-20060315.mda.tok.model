back to table of contents december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents working capital total assets total stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience  future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of collectibility of accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition liveperson is a provider of online conversion solutions 
our hosted software enables companies to identify and proactively engage online visitors increasing sales  satisfaction and loyalty while reducing service costs 
liveperson s fully integrated multi channel communications platform  timpani  facilitates real time sales  marketing and customer service 
our technology supports and manages key online interactions via chat  email and self service knowledgebase in a cost effective and secure environment 
blending leading technology  a deep understanding of consumer behavior and industry best practices to create more relevant  compelling and personalized online experiences  liveperson maximizes the business impact of the online channel 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
certain of our larger clients  who require more sophisticated implementation and training  may also pay an initial non refundable set up fee and professional service fees related to implementation 
we also occasionally charge professional service fees related to additional training and business consulting and analysis 
the initial set up fee is intended to recover certain costs principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to the deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over a period of months  representing the estimated term of the client relationships 
although we believe this estimate is reasonable  this estimate may change in the future 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we typically do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more services 
unamortized deferred fees  if any  are recognized upon termination of the agreement with the customer 
we recognized set up fees due to client attrition of   and in  and  respectively 

back to table of contents we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
these sales typically have no set up fee  because we do not provide the customer with training and administrative costs are minimal 
we record revenue based upon a monthly fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we recognize monthly service fees as services are provided 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance of the professional service engagement 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and no single customer accounted for or exceeded of accounts receivable at december  one customer accounted for approximately of accounts receivable at december  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates

the net acquisition costs of  and million are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  and december  balance sheets  respectively 
in january  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of up to  shares of our common stock by island data 
our registration of the resale of the shares was required by our agreement with island data 
the shares registered for resale on the registration statement  but not actually issued to island data pursuant to the agreement  will be deregistered 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock covered by the island data registration statement

our set up fee is intended to recover certain costs incurred by us principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over a period of months  representing the estimated term of the client relationships 
as a result of recognizing set up fees in this manner  combined with the fact that a small proportion of our clients are charged a set up fee  revenue attributable to our monthly service fee accounted for   and of total liveperson services revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  because we typically do not charge a set up fee for sales generated via internet download  we expect the set up fee to continue to represent a small percentage of total revenue 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we typically do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more services 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize monthly service fees and professional service fees as services are provided 
professional service fees consist of additional training and business consulting and analysis provided to customers  both at the initial launch and over the term of the contract
