business environment 
several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger s business environment

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require grainger to redeem these bonds  thus a portion are classified as current maturities of long term debt

off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the decline in market interest rates 
grainger estimates that the reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease pretax earnings by approximately million 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index to develop its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
while grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates  and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate  changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and  therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivables 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
income taxes 
grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities 
future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
the forward looking statements relate to grainger s expected future financial results and business plans  strategies and objectives and are not historical facts 
they are often identified by qualifiers such as will  could  should  might  may  would  tend  planned  presumption  expects  intends  is likely  anticipates  scheduled  believes  positions it  continue  estimates  forecast  predicting  projection  potential  assumption or similar expressions 
there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger s results to differ materially from what is projected 
factors that may affect forward looking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger s businesses  failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  changes in laws and regulations  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 
trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions  gross domestic product growth rates  general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations  global and other conflicts  employment levels and other factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during a portion of and all of  grainger partially hedged its net canadian dollar investment in acklands with a cross currency swap agreement 
this agreement was terminated in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net income 
comparatively  in a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net income 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in net income for  as compared with an increase in net income of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio 
during and  all of its long term debt was variable rate debt 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately million for and million for a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to income of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or long term debt levels 
grainger s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the cross currency swap and related commercial paper debt during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly
