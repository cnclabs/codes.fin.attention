onshore gulf coast the onshore gulf coast region is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
in addition  certain sand reservoirs display seismic bright spots  which can be direct hydrocarbon indicators and can result in greatly reduced drilling risk 
however  bright spots are not always reliable as direct hydrocarbon indicators and do not generally assess reservoir productivity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated 
table of contents knowledge base in this province  particularly given our historical drilling successes in this province  provides us with significant competitive advantages 
we recently announced joint ventures with two operators to explore for oil and gas in southern louisiana 
we view southern louisiana as a logical extension of our current activities in the upper texas gulf coast that target the frio trend 
over the three year period ended december   approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic were allocated to our onshore gulf coast province where we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of in this province 
we also had one well net that was in progress at december  six of these wells were exploration  were development and we operated all of the wells that we drilled in this province during for  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately of the drilling capital spent in our onshore gulf coast province during was allocated to the vicksburg trend and was allocated to the frio trend 
for  we currently plan to spend a total of million in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately million of this spending has been allocated to drilling  with the remaining million allocated to capital spending for land and seismic activities 
approximately million of the drilling capital allocated to our onshore gulf coast province in is expected to be spent to drill development wells with an average working interest of and for other development activities 
as of february   the development well that was in progress at december  is completing and of the development wells planned for our onshore gulf coast province in  one was completing and one well was drilling 
the nine remaining development wells that we plan to drill in this province in will commence later this year 
the remaining million of the total million in drilling capital we plan to spend in our onshore gulf coast province in is expected to be allocated to drill nine exploration wells with an average working interest of 
the nine exploration wells that we plan to spud in this province in will commence drilling during the remaining three quarters of five of the wells we plan to drill in our gulf coast province are higher risk but high reserve potential wells 
vicksburg trend our vicksburg activity is focused principally in brooks county  texas  in our home run  triple crown  and floyd fields 
we discovered these fields in  and  respectively 
in  our development drilling targeting the vicksburg was focused in our home run and triple crown fields 
during the year we completed three wells in our triple crown field and two wells in our home run field  at initial rates ranging from to mmcfe per day 
the working interests we retained in the vicksburg wells we drilled during were higher than our historical average working interest in our vicksburg wells 
a contributing factor to this increase was our joint venture with an industry participant  where we increased our working interest to from our previous in the acre area of mutual interest by paying the promoted drilling cost on the first well  the dj sullivan c during much of our exploratory activity in the vicksburg trend has been driven by similar joint ventures with our industry participant  which has substantial acreage holdings in the area 
in addition  we continue to have discussions with our industry participant about other exploratory joint venture opportunities in the area  and expect to continue to expand our activities in the trend 
for  we currently plan to spend million to drill five development wells  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
we expect to retain an average working interest of in these development wells 
as of february   one of these five wells was completing 
the remaining four vicksburg development wells planned for will commence drilling later in the year 

table of contents since  we have drilled twenty nine vicksburg wells  and we have completed of those tests 
we believe we have a multi year inventory of drilling locations in our home run  triple crown and floyd fault block fields  and we expect to add to this inventory 
frio trend during  we drilled wells that targeted the frio  including five exploratory and seven development wells 
for  we currently plan to spend million to drill four exploration wells with an average working interest of and four development wells with an average working interest of  to drill and complete wells that were in progress at december  and for other development activities 
through february   one of these eight wells had started drilling 
the seven remaining frio wells that we plan to drill in will commence drilling later this year 
early in  we made an apparently significant discovery with our wyse  the discovery well for the bouldin lake field 
we operated the drilling of the wyse with a working interest  with another operator participating with a working interest 
the wyse produced at an early rate of approximately mmcfe per day from the lower frio 
approximately feet of additional potential lower frio pay remains behind pipe for future completion 
during the third quarter of  the wyse was fracture stimulated  and began producing water and approximately mmcfe per day of natural gas and condensate 
we continue to evaluate various options  including but not limited to attempting to squeeze off the water producing zone or to setting a plug above the current pay intervals in order to complete the apparent pay in a shallower lower frio interval 
during the fourth quarter  we completed the grisham  our first development well in the bouldin lake field 
we operated the drilling of the grisham with a working interest 
subsequent to fracture stimulation of the lowest feet of apparent pay  the grisham commenced production at an initial rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
an additional feet of apparent pay remains behind pipe for future completion 
in early february  while we were attempting to commingle the upper pay interval we discovered a problem with the casing 
operations are underway to determine the severity of the problem and we expect to reestablish production sometime in march we currently plan to commence the drilling of the wyse  in march  our third well in the bouldin lake field 
we will operate the wyse with a working interest and expect to encounter the pay intervals approximately feet high to those we found in the wyse discovery well 
results for the wyse are expected in may 
we currently expect to commence our fourth bouldin lake field well  the grisham  late in the third quarter of we will also operate the drilling of the grisham with a working interest 
depending on success of the wyse and the grisham  two additional wells could be drilled to fully develop the field 
another potentially significant discovery during was our state tract  which generated an early production rate of approximately mmcfe per day from a lower frio anomalina interval with strong flowing casing pressures 
in the same area  but in a different fault block  the bayou bengal b  after stimulation and commingling  began producing at a rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
the bayou bengal b also encountered approximately feet of apparent net pay in the shallower f series frio sands  while the state tract encountered comparable f series frio sands with approximately feet of apparent net pay 
these shallower zones are currently behind pipe for future completion 
in december  we commenced the state tract  the first offset to the bayou bengal b and state tract discoveries 
the state tract is the first well we have drilled to develop the shallower apparent f series frio pay sands encountered in both the bayou bengal b and the state tract with success  other wells would be required to fully develop the estimated acre structure 
during  we drilled our first two wells in our alamo project  a d project acquired during late and early the imhoff  which encountered approximately feet of apparent lower frio pay  and the bk dillard  which encountered only feet of apparent lower frio pay  both produced non commercial oil and natural gas volumes and are currently not producing 
we operated both wells with 
table of contents working interests 
we have a number of prospects identified under lease in our alamo project and we may drill one of these during the second half of during  we currently plan to drill four wells in our general lee project 
we acquired approximately square miles of d seismic data over our general lee project in late three of these wells will test the largest lower frio structures we have mapped in the trend to date 
we will operate all three tests with a working interest 
two of these wells will test the green ranch structural complex  which covers approximately  acres 
we expect to commence these wells  the green ranch and the green ranch deep  during the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
during the third quarter  we expect to commence drilling the sunset reef  another well in our general lee project 
this prospect covers approximately  acres and a structure that to date has produced approximately bcfe from the shallower miocene interval 
none of the wells that are productive in the shallower miocene interval have penetrated the deeper frio objectives 
as was the case in  in we will continue to assemble new d projects that add to our inventory of drilling projects in the frio 
during  we expect to acquire a new proprietary d seismic project in the trend  which is expected to cover approximately to square miles 
we expect to retain a working interest in this project 
gulf coast louisiana miocene and upper oligocene trends in february  we announced two new joint ventures with two operators to explore and develop d delineated projects that target the miocene and upper oligocene trends located in south louisiana 
we view these projects as a logical extension of our activities in the upper texas gulf coast that target the frio trend 
in this area  we will utilize our geophysical  geological and operational expertise to explore for and develop potential reservoirs directly on trend to that of the frio 
as part of the joint ventures  we have committed to drill a minimum of three wells  at least two of which will be drilled in in our bayou postillion project located in iberia parish  louisiana  we will operate the drilling of the first of these wells  the cotten land corp 
 with a after casing point working interest 
we expect to commence drilling the well early in the second quarter of the cotten land corp 
directly offsets and is expected to encounter a miocene objective  approximately feet high to a recent discovery 
the offsetting producer was completed in august at an initial rate of mmcfe per day  and at last report continued to produce at approximately the same rate 
in addition  seven wells in an adjacent fault block have produced approximately bcfe to date and are still actively producing 
in the same area  but in a different fault block  we will operate the drilling of the cotten land corp 
with a working interest 
we expect to commence drilling this well in may  immediately following the cotten land corp 
with success  two additional wells could be drilled to fully develop the area 
in our mystic bayou project located in st 
martin parish  louisiana  we will also operate the drilling of the williams land company well 
we have identified at least three apparent fault blocks to test  all three of which are expected to encounter a miocene objective structurally high to two wells that have combined to produce over bcfe to date 
we will retain a working interest in the williams land company  which is expected to commence drilling during the third quarter of anadarko basin the anadarko basin is located in northwest oklahoma and the texas panhandle 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of relatively lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher risk  but higher reserve potential opportunities in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 

table of contents we believe our drilling programs in the anadarko basin and west texas generally provide us with longer life reserves and help to balance our drilling program in the prolific  but generally shorter reserve life  onshore gulf coast province 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of these prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives if the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton  springer channel and springer bar trends 
over the past three years  approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our anadarko basin province where we have completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
one development well net  which commenced drilling operations prior to december   is currently completing 
of the wells we drilled and completed wells in  four were exploration wells and ten were development wells 
we operated four of the wells that we drilled and completed in the anadarko basin in for  we currently plan to spend million in our anadarko basin province 
approximately million of this spending is currently allocated to drilling with the remaining million allocated to land and seismic activities 
approximately million of the drilling capital allocated to our anadarko basin province is expected to be spent to drill ten development wells with an average working interest of and for other development activities 
as of february   of the ten development wells that we plan to drill in our anadarko basin province in  one well was drilling 
the nine remaining development wells planned for this province will commence drilling later in the remaining million of the total million in drilling capital allocated to our anadarko basin province is expected to be spent to drill five exploration wells with an average working interest of 
as of february   none of the five exploration wells that we currently plan to drill in this province during had commenced drilling 
of the drilling capital that we spent in our anadarko basin province in  approximately was allocated to the hunton trend  was allocated to the springer trends and was allocated to the granite wash trend 
for  approximately million of our planned drilling expenditures that we plan to spend in our anadarko basin province is allocated to the hunton trend  million is allocated to the springer trends and million is allocated to the granite wash trend 
hunton trend during  we completed a significant development well  offsetting our late discovery well in the mills ranch field 
we operated the mills ranch with a working interest  which commenced production during the third quarter at mmcfe per day  and subsequently produced at rates as high as mmcfe per day 
we expect to drill at least three more wells to fully develop the field  two of which are planned for during the first quarter of  we commenced operations on a reentry and sidetrack of the previously drilled mills ranch s 
after completing the mills ranch s in the hunton at an initial rate of approximately mmcfe per day  production from the well declined sharply  indicating that the well was probably in a fault block that had very limited aerial extent 
the mills ranch s is an attempt to reenter this well and sidetrack out of the mills ranch s borehole at a depth of approximately  feet 
we plan to subsequently directionally drill to a depth of approximately  feet to test the hunton in what we expect to be an adjacent  and potentially much larger  fault 
table of contents block 
results are expected in the second quarter of we will retain an average working interest of in the mills ranch s in february  we will also commence the drilling of the mills ranch  a development well on the westernmost end of the field 
this well will offset our mills ranch well  which to date has produced approximately bcfe  since coming on line in late december we expect to retain a working interest of between and in this well  which will target the hunton formation at a depth of approximately  feet 
results for the mills ranch are expected late in the third quarter of granite wash in the texas panhandle of the anadarko basin  we drilled seven granite wash wells during four of these wells were very low working interest non operated completions 
however  three of these were higher working interest operated wells that were drilled to evaluate the economics of our approximately  contiguous gross acres in hemphill county 
adjacent acreage to this contiguous block continues to experience extensive drilling by other operators  most of which has been developed on acre spacing  although some acreage is being developed on acre spacing 
our two most recent granite wash completions in this contiguous block  the hobart and the hobart  commenced production at rates of and mmcfe per day subsequent to fracture stimulation  the highest rates achieved in this area by us to date 
late in  we commenced the hobart  which encountered approximately feet of apparent granite wash pay  comparable to our two most recent completions 
production to sales for the hobart is expected in late february 
in february  we commenced the hobart with a working interest 
results for this well are expected in late march 
although no additional wells in our  acre contiguous acreage block are currently planned for  with continued drilling success and strong commodity prices  we could accelerate our granite wash drilling program in assuming acre spacing  approximately additional locations could be drilled to fully develop the acreage 
west texas the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico is a predominantly oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of the onshore gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  the wolfcamp and devonian section of new mexico  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 
over the past three years  approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic have been allocated to our west texas province where we have completed seven gross wells net in ten attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed two gross wells net in three attempts for a completion rate of 
two of these wells were exploration  one was development and we operated all of these wells 
in total  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic during in our west texas province 
for  we currently plan to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
approximately million of this is allocated to land and seismic expenditures  million is allocated to drill three exploration wells with an average working interest of working interest and the remainder is allocated to drill one development well with an working interest and for other development activities 
as of february   of the four wells we plan to drill in our west texas province in  one had been drilled and not completed and one was currently drilling 
the remaining two wells planned for our west texas province will commence drilling later in 
table of contents given our large inventory of d seismic data in west texas and new mexico  our strong historical results in the province and currently strong oil prices  we have begun to focus more of our resources on exploiting this asset base 
williston basin bakken on november   we made a million acquisition of approximately  net acres in the bakken play located in sections in northwestern north dakota 
we acquired a working interest in the bakken formation within the applicable oil and natural gas leases 
with success  between and wells could be required to fully develop the acreage 
given our working interest in the sections  we expect to operate the majority of the drilling and completion operations on our acreage 
the bakken play objective in this area is an unconventional oil play at a depth of approximately  feet 
we plan to drill vertical wells in this area with lateral extensions ranging from  to  feet at an estimated completed well cost of to million 
this is a potential extension of ongoing bakken activity in richland county  montana  located approximately to miles to the west 
within a square mile area of richland county  montana  approximately bakken wells have generated average initial production rates of approximately barrels of oil per day  average cumulative production to date of approximately  barrels of oil per well  and estimated ultimate recoveries of approximately  barrels of oil per well based on data compiled from external sources 
for  we currently plan to spend million on drilling  land  and seismic in our williston basin province 
approximately million of this capital is allocated to drilling four pilot wells with a average working interest 
we will operate these four wells and currently plan to commence drilling and operate the first of these wells in the second quarter 
with drilling success  the bakken play could become a new focus trend for us 
d seismic exploration we have accumulated d seismic data covering approximately  square miles million acres in over geologic trends in seven basins and seven states 
we typically acquire d seismic data in and around existing producing fields where we can benefit from the imaging of producing analog wells 
these d defined analogs  combined with our experience in drilling wells in our d project areas  provide us with a knowledge base to evaluate other potential geologic trends  d seismic projects within these trends and prospective d delineated drilling locations 
through our experience in the early and mid s  we developed an expertise in the selection of geologic trends that we believe are best suited for d seismic exploration 
in and we invested approximately million in d seismic and land in plays that we believed were providing optimal d delineated drilling economics 
since  we have continued to add to our d seismic database within our core trends on a more conservative pace 
we have used the experience that we have gained within our core trends to enhance the quality of subsequent projects in the same trend and other analogous trends  to lower finding and development costs  to compress project cycle times and to enhance our return on capital 
over the last years  we have accumulated substantial experience exploring with d seismic in a wide range of reservoir types and geologic trapping mechanisms 
in addition  we typically acquire digital databases for integration on our computer aided exploration workstations  including digital land grids  well information  log curves  production information  geologic studies  geologic top databases and existing d seismic data 
we use our knowledge base  local geological expertise and digital databases integrated with d seismic data to create maps of producing and potentially productive reservoirs 
as such  we believe our d generated maps are more accurate than previous reservoir maps which generally are based on subsurface geological information and d seismic surveys  enabling us to more precisely evaluate recoverable reserves and the economic feasibility of projects and drilling locations 
historically  we have acquired most of our raw d seismic data using seismic acquisition vendors on either a proprietary basis or through alliances affording the alliance members the exclusive right to 
table of contents interpret and use data for extended periods of time 
in addition  we have participated in non proprietary group shoots of d seismic data commonly referred to as spec data when we believe the expected full cycle project economics were justified  and we have exchanged certain interests in some of our non core proprietary seismic data to gain access to additional d seismic data 
in most of our proprietary d data acquisitions and alliances  we have selected the sites of projects  primarily guided by our knowledge and experience in the core provinces we explore  established and monitored the seismic parameters of each project for which data was shot  and typically selected the equipment that was used 
combining our geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  we manage the majority of our projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  we manage the negotiation and drafting of virtually all of our geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because we generate most of our projects  we can often control the size of the working interest that we retain as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
consistent with our business strategy  we have increased the working interest we retain in our projects  based upon capital availability and perceived risk 
our average working interest in our d seismic projects acquired during  and was  and  respectively 
the d seismic we acquired during   and was primarily through the exchange of certain rights in some of our non core d seismic projects 
most of these exchanges did not include an industry participant  therefore we retained potentially all interest in any prospects generated from the newly acquired d seismic data 
in early  we acquired approximately square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our general patton project located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in this project to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest in the project 
in and early  we acquired approximately square miles of non proprietary and square miles of new proprietary d seismic data and purchased an ownership interest in square miles of pre existing proprietary d seismic data in our bayou bengal project  also located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in bayou bengal to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
of this total  we acquired approximately square miles of non proprietary and square miles of new proprietary d seismic data in our alamo project located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in alamo to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest in the project 
also included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in were approximately square miles of new proprietary data we acquired in our general lee project  which is located in the frio trend of the upper texas gulf coast 
we sold a working interest in general lee to an industry participant on a promoted basis and retained a working interest 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
all square miles of d seismic data acquired were non proprietary to us 
included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in was approximately square miles of data in our mudflats project located in the frio trend along the lower texas gulf coast 
we retained a working interest in our mudflats project

table of contents oil and natural gas reserves our estimated total net proved reserves of oil and natural gas as of december   and  pre tax pv value  standardized measure and the estimated future development cost attributable to these reserves as of those dates were as follows 
at december  estimated net proved reserves oil mbbls natural gas mmcf natural gas equivalent mmcfe proved developed reserves as a percentage of net proved reserves pre tax pv in millions a standardized measure in millions estimated future development cost in millions base price used to calculate reserves b natural gas per mmbtu oil per bbl a see reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv for a definition of pre tax pv and a reconciliation of our standardized measure to our pre tax pv value 
b these base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at these dates 
the reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  our independent petroleum consultants  and are part of reports on our oil and natural gas properties prepared by them 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues there from are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cawley  gillespie associates  inc report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves  included in our security and exchange commission filings  have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency 
see item a 
risk factors although our oil and gas reserve data is independently estimated  these estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual 
table of contents production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial 
reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv pre tax pv is the estimated present value of the future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income taxes discounted using a discount rate 
pre tax pv is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations because it does not include the effects of future income taxes  as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we believe that pre tax pv is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and that pre tax pv is widely used by security analysts and investors when evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
we believe that most other companies in the oil and natural gas industry calculate pre tax pv on the same basis 
pre tax pv is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting income taxes 
the table below provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to our pre tax pv value 
at december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pre tax pv drilling activities we drilled  or participated in the drilling of  the following number of wells during the periods indicated
