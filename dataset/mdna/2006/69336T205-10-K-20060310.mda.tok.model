item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview operating revenues increased in our domestic oil and gas segment in due to increased flight hours resulting from increased customer demand for aircraft 
the increased activity was due primarily to increased exploration and production activity by our customers in the gulf of mexico 
additional demand was also caused by the effects of recent hurricanes  as customers experienced logistical challenges as they repaired facilities in the gulf of mexico 
as discussed below  we have more new aircraft scheduled for delivery in and for use in our domestic oil and gas segment 
our air medical segment experienced significant revenue growth as a result of the expansion to additional locations  however patient transport volume was negatively affected by weather in the fourth quarter 
in  we opened additional locations  seven of which opened in the fourth quarter 
in total  we have opened locations since december in the air medical expansion 
all segments experienced an increase in flight hours in  with total flight hours of  for compared to  for  an increase of 
the number of aircraft in service at december   was compared to at december  fifteen new aircraft were delivered in for service in the domestic oil and gas segment  and eleven light aircraft were sold  for a net increase of four aircraft 
aircraft in the air medical segment increased by  and aircraft in the international segment decreased by three  which we sold 

table of contents operating revenues for were million compared to million for  an increase of million 
domestic oil and gas operating revenues increased million due primarily to an increase in flight hours to  for compared to  in  and also due to customer requirements for additional aircraft 
operating revenues in the air medical segment increased million  or  due to the additional air medical operations established during and  further discussed in the segment discussion 
in addition  the international segment had an increase of million in operating revenues due to an increase in rates and flight hours 
a decrease of million in technical services operating revenues due to completion of that segment s principal contract in partially offset the increases in the other segments 
direct operating expense was million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
direct expense increased million in the domestic oil and gas segment  and million in the air medical segment  both due to increased operations  and million in the international segment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the technical services segment due to reduced activity as a result of completion of its principal contract in these increases are discussed more in detail in the segment discussion 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million resulting from increases in corporate administration costs due primarily to increased legal expenses related to the department of justice subpoena and increased depreciation expense 
this is also discussed further in the segment discussion 
two significant hurricanes affected our operations during the third and fourth quarters of hurricane katrina made landfall in southeastern louisiana on august  and caused substantial flooding at our base at boothville  louisiana  which we expect to be out of service until late other bases incurred some damage  most of which has been repaired as of december   and those bases are now back in service 
on september   hurricane rita made landfall in southwestern louisiana destroying our base in cameron  and causing flooding and wind damage at other bases 
most of this damage has been repaired and bases are back in service excluding the cameron base 
all employees were accounted for and there were no injuries reported 
we evacuated all aircraft prior to both storms and suffered no damage to aircraft 
we currently estimate that our insurance claim related to all damage will be approximately million  and we expect that substantially all costs incurred will be covered by insurance 
at december   we recorded the write off of assets consisting of million of inventory and other tangible assets and million of incremental repair and relocation costs  a total of million 
these amounts were completely offset by estimated insurance recoveries of which million remains in accounts receivable  other 
we anticipate incurring additional repair costs of approximately million in to restore damaged facilities and we also expect that substantially all of such costs will be covered by insurance 
if the estimates of our damages and insurance recoveries prove to be reasonably accurate  we do not believe that we will record any loss related to these claims for financial reporting purposes 
we would expect to have an unreimbursed cash outlay of approximately million  due to the difference in insurance reimbursement compared to replacement cost for certain assets that had been in service for a number of years 
flight hours were adversely affected initially as aircraft were evacuated and grounded until the storm passed 
when flights resumed  we experienced an increase in flight hours as customers began assessing damage and making repairs to facilities in the gulf of mexico 
additionally  the air medical segment experienced higher than normal flight activity in the third quarter while assisting with the evacuations of new orleans and areas in southeastern texas 
as reported in our june  form q  we completed the sale of  shares of non voting common stock at per share  which included the exercise by our underwriters of an over allotment option covering  shares 
proceeds from the offering were approximately million  net of expenses 
remaining proceeds at december  from the offering were million 
all amounts have been used for the acquisition of aircraft  as will the remaining balance also be used 
as previously reported  on june  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice relating to a grand jury investigation of potential antitrust violations among providers of helicopter transportation services in the gulf of mexico 
we are cooperating fully with the investigation and are nearing completion of providing documents and other information as required by the subpoena 
we will respond to any doj request for further information  and will continue to cooperate with the investigation 
at this early stage  it is not possible to assess the outcome of this investigation  although based on the information available to us to date  management does not expect the outcome of the investigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as discussed in the december  form k and form q filings in  the expansion of the air medical segment continued in our focus in will be to improve the margins in this segment 
in total  locations have been opened since december in  new programs were started  seven of which were started in the fourth 
table of contents quarter 
new programs typically take several months to build sufficient volume to absorb facility operating costs and achieve profitable aircraft utilization levels 
in  we took delivery of three transport category aircraft  four medium aircraft and eight light aircraft for service in the domestic oil and gas segment 
we also took delivery of eleven light aircraft for service in the air medical segment 
subsequent to december   we took delivery of one transport category  one medium  and two light aircraft  all for service in domestic oil and gas  and one light aircraft for service in the air medical segment 
we entered into operating leases for the transport category aircraft 
at december   we had an order for three additional transport category aircraft  one of which was delivered early january and an operating lease was executed for that aircraft 
there are two transport category aircraft remaining for delivery in at an approximate cost of million  for which we intend to execute an operating lease for these aircraft also 
in addition to the transport category aircraft discussed above  at december   we had orders for additional aircraft with a total cost of million with scheduled delivery dates throughout and of this total  four aircraft totaling million were delivered subsequent to december   as mentioned above 
the aircraft on order are for service in the domestic oil and gas segment and are based on customer commitments

liquidity and capital resources general our ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of working capital needs  such as the acquisition or leasing of aircraft  the maintenance and refurbishment of aircraft  improvement of facilities  and equipment and inventory 
our principal sources of liquidity historically have been net cash provided by our operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as augmented in recent years by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in and the sale of non voting common stock in as we grow our operations  we continually monitor the capital resources available to meet our future financial obligations  planned capital expenditures and liquidity 
we also review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis 
if we were to 
table of contents make a significant acquisition for cash  we would need to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
additionally  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or restructure our current debt to optimize our capital structure 
cash flow our cash position at december  was million  compared to million at december  working capital was million at december   as compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in working capital was a result of an increase in cash of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in cash was due primarily to completion of the equity offering in june  with remaining cash from the offering being million at december  the remaining increase was due to increased cash flow from operations 
the increase in accounts receivable of million was due primarily to the increase in revenue in the air medical segment 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net earnings of million  an increase in the deferred tax provision of million  changes in working capital of million  and other items  net  million

gross proceeds from aircraft sales were million for compared to million for financing activities our series b senior unsecured notes due bear annual interest at payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
the series b senior unsecured notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  dividends  repurchases of capital stock and other payments affecting restricted subsidiaries  issuance and sales of restricted subsidiary stock  issuance of debt securities  dispositions of proceeds of asset sales  and mergers and consolidations or sales of assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
estimated future interest costs on the series b senior unsecured notes due are million per year for the years through  and million for when the notes are due 
this excludes amortization of issuance costs of approximately million per year 
credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank  which expires on july  as of december   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the letters of credit are related to our workers compensation insurance 
the facility includes covenants related to working capital  funded debt to net worth  and consolidated net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
also included in notes payable is million related to the interim financing of a progress payment for the acquisition of a heavy transport aircraft delivered in january contractual obligations the table below sets out our contractual obligations related to operating lease obligations  notes payable and the series b senior unsecured notes due in the operating leases are not recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  but payments are treated as an expense as incurred 
each contractual obligation included in the table contains various terms  conditions  and covenants which  if violated  accelerate the payment of that obligation 
we currently lease twelve aircraft included in the lease obligations below 

table of contents payment due by year beyond total thousands of dollars aircraft purchase commitments aircraft purchase commitments aircraft lease obligations facility lease obligations notes payable long term debt these commitments are for aircraft that we intend to finance through a combination of operating leases  remaining cash from the equity offering completed june and additional debt or equity financing sources that we are currently reviewing but are not yet committed 
these commitments are for aircraft that we intend to finance with an operating lease 
estimated interest costs on the debt obligations set forth above  without considering any additional debt that may be obtained relative to purchase commitments for aircraft  are as follows in thousands     and in  we took delivery of three transport category aircraft  four medium aircraft and eight light aircraft for service in the domestic oil and gas segment 
we also took delivery of eleven light aircraft for service in the air medical segment 
subsequent to december   we took delivery of one transport category  one medium  and two light aircraft  all for service in domestic oil and gas  and one light aircraft for service in the air medical segment 
we executed operating leases for the transport category aircraft 
at december   we had an order for three additional transport category aircraft  one of which was delivered in early january and financed with an operating lease 
the remaining two aircraft are scheduled for delivery in at an approximate cost of million  and are also expected to be financed with an operating lease 
at december   we also had orders for additional aircraft with a total cost of million and scheduled delivery dates throughout and of this total  four aircraft totaling million were delivered subsequent to december   as mentioned above 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund operating requirements and required interest payments on the notes for the next twelve months 
we have capital requirements for aircraft on order totaling million over and  for which we do not yet have committed financing 
we are considering various options to fund the acquisition of aircraft which may include one or more of the following options  including the use of existing cash  operating leases and the possible issuance of equity and or debt securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united 
table of contents states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long lived assets and self insurance liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is estimated based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if our evaluation of our significant customers and debtors creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then we may have to recognize additional allowances in the period in which we identify the risk of loss 
in the air medical segment  estimates are made of contractual allowances based on historical collection rates by payor group 
this is adjusted periodically based on actual collection experience 
we maintain a significant parts inventory to service our own aircraft and the aircraft and components of customers 
portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components and reworked to a useable condition 
we use systematic procedures to estimate the valuation of the used parts  which includes consideration of their condition and continuing utility 
if our valuation of these parts should be significantly different from amounts ultimately realizable or if we discontinue using or servicing certain aircraft models  then we may have to record a write down of our inventory 
we also record provisions against inventory for obsolescent and slow moving parts  relying principally on specific identification of such inventory 
if we fail to identify such parts  additional provisions may be necessary 
our principal long lived assets are aircraft 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows that we expect the asset to generate 
when an asset is determined to be impaired  we recognize the impairment amount  which is the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
similarly  we report assets that we expect to sell at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in an inability to recover the current carrying value of certain long lived assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we must make estimates for certain of our liabilities and expenses  losses  and gains related to self insured programs  insurance deductibles  and good experience premium returns 
our group medical insurance program is largely self insured  and we use estimates to record our periodic expenses related to that program 
we also carry deductibles on our workers compensation program and aircraft hull and liability insurance  and poor experience or higher accidents rates could result in additional recorded losses 
trade receivables representing amounts due pursuant to air medical services are carried net of an allowance for estimated contractual adjustments on unsettled invoices 
the company monitors its collection experience by payor category within the air medical segment and updates its estimated collections to be realized based on its most recent collection experience 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the company  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we have an aggregate estimated liability of million as of december  for environmental remediation costs that are probable and estimable 
we have conducted environmental surveys of our former lafayette facility  which we vacated in  and have determined that limited soil and groundwater contamination exists at the facility 
we have installed groundwater monitoring wells at the facility and periodically monitor and report on the contamination 
in may  we submitted a louisiana risk evaluation corrective action plan recap standard site assessment report to the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq fully delineating the extent and type of contamination 
ldeq is reviewing the assessment report and has requested that the site assessment report be updated to include recent 
table of contents analytical data and be resubmitted for further ldeq review 
once ldeq completes its review and reports on whether all contamination has been fully defined  a risk evaluation in accordance with recap will be submitted and evaluated by ldeq 
at that point  ldeq will establish what cleanup standards must be met at the site 
when the process is complete  we will be in a position to develop an appropriate remediation plan and determine the resulting cost of remediation 
we have not recorded any estimated liability for remediation and contamination and  based upon the may site assessment report and ongoing monitoring  we believe the ultimate remediation costs for the former lafayette facility will not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
during  ldeq advised us that groundwater contaminants impacting monitor wells at the phi lafayette heliport were originating from an off site location and that we would no longer be required to perform further monitoring at the site 
subsequently  based upon site investigation work performed by the lafayette airport commission  the source of the contamination was identified as residing at another location  for which phi is not responsible 
the lafayette airport commission has begun remediation of the phi lafayette heliport 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and prior to april   we made limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage that risk 
when used  all derivatives for risk management are closely monitored by our senior management 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes and we do not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are transacted either with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges 
also on april   we issued notes of million that have an interest rate of payable semi annually on may and november of each year  beginning november   and mature in may the market value of the notes will vary as changes occur to general market interest rates  the remaining maturity of the notes  and our credit worthiness 
at december   the market value of the notes was million 
a hypothetical basis point increase to the notes imputed interest rate at december  would have resulted in a market value decline to approximately million
