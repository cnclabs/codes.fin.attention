page ebitda ebitda represents net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda because we consider such information an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization to us  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we also use ebitda as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
our credit agreement uses ebitda with additional adjustments to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurred 
ebitda is also used by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions with us 
in addition  ebitda is also widely used by us and other buyers to evaluate and determine the price of potential acquisition candidates 
for  our ebitda was  compared with  for  and as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
we expect that the percentage of incremental ebitda to incremental revenues projected to be added in the year ending december  will be in the range of and 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a principal indicator of our performance 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only on a supplemental basis 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the current and prior year

critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the selection and application of significant accounting policies  and which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies 
page revenue recognition our services are provided under a combination of fixed monthly fees and time and materials billings 
contracts with customers typically range from two to seven years 
revenue is recognized after we have obtained an executed service contract from the customer  as the services are rendered  when the price is fixed as per the service contract  and when we believe that collectibility is reasonably assured  based on our credit risk policies and procedures that we employ 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining these allowances  we evaluate a number of factors  including the credit risk of customers  historical trends  and other relevant information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
business combinations our current acquisitions and future acquisitions of businesses that we will control will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions will be based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as goodwill 
the fair values will be determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information will include valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations will generally be based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by management and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions include customer lists  customer relationships  property and equipment and goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
however  we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which will then be compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
the implied fair value of reporting unit will be determined by our management and will generally be based upon future cash flow projections for the reporting unit  discounted to present value 
we will use outside valuation experts when management considers that it would be appropriate to do so 
intangibles subject to amortization  including customer lists and customer relationships  are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
we take into consideration the history of contract renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we analyze our customer lists on a case by case basis  with examination of the history of contract renewals as well as other factors  such as material changes to contract terms or significant new commitments where applicable 
such estimates are based on management s judgment of its current relationship with the relevant customers and its estimate of future economic 
changes to either of these factors could result in an impairment charge  which could have a material effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
page customer relationships are essential to our business 
in determining the value of these relationships  we discounted the expected returns for each contract using a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining terms of the contract 
we further estimate that it would be unlikely that a customer would terminate its contract  due to the quality of service currently provided as well as the lack of viable alternatives 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset is expected to remain in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we will review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they may have changed from our initial assessment 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
we will perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in the long lived assets physical condition 
when indicators of impairment are present  management determines whether the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the estimates of both the undiscounted future cash flows and the fair values of assets require the use of complex models that require numerous highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
deferred taxes our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
a tax valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount for which recovery is probable 
based on our profitability in and our forecasts  we determined that it would be more likely than not that our net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences will be realized 
accordingly  we released the full valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income on sms  we recorded a valuation allowance equal to of its net deferred tax assets at december  in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings from sms in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase goodwill in the period that such determination was made 
stock based compensation to date  we have accounted for stock based compensation by using the intrinsic value based method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  we have only recorded compensation expense for any stock options granted with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
refer to the section entitled recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of the impact of the recently issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  on our recording of stock based compensation fiscal years beginning on or after december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which eliminated the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
page in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 
sfas r will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of the following two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all shared based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for shared based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for options issued through february   the projected after tax expense in   and is   and  respectively 
we have not determined what impact sfas r might have on the nature of our shared based compensation to employees in the future
