item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent developments we recently announced the completion of patient enrollment in our pivotal phase iii trial in which our polyheme human red blood cell substitute product was used for the first time in the civilian  urban trauma settings to treat severely injured patients in hemorrhagic shock before they reach the hospital 
under this protocol  treatment with polyheme began at the scene of the injury or in the ambulance and continued during transport and the initial hour post injury period in the hospital 
since blood is not routinely carried in ambulances  the use of polyheme in this setting has the potential to improve patient survival and address a critical  unmet medical need 
we anticipate that we will require approximately three months from the date of the completion of patient enrollment to monitor and lock the database from our pivotal phase iii trial 
after the trial database is locked  we expect to report top line data from the trial during the fourth quarter of calendar year our goal is to 
table of contents submit a biologics license application  or bla  to fda based on data from our current trial during the first half of calendar year since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling we will be required to prepare and submit a bla to fda and obtain regulatory approval from fda before polyheme can be sold commercially 
the fda regulatory process is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
we therefore cannot at this time reasonably estimate the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are described in the statements of operations in our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by 
during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  we significantly expanded our pivotal phase iii trial 
an additional trial sites opened during fiscal with the attendant community consultation  training and trial initiation costs 
patient enrollment likewise accelerated with more clinical sites open and more sites gaining experience with the trial protocol 
the direct costs of the trial  hospital site activity and contract research activity totaled  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal additional costs were also recorded for increasing staff  benefit costs  insurance and science consulting 
during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from the fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  northfield opened nine additional clinical sites  for a total of sites  in order to accelerate patient enrollment in our pivotal phase iii trial 
expense related to these openings included community consultation  training and trial initiation 
with greater numbers of study patients  the direct cost of site charges  lab fees and third party monitoring also increased 
over the course of fiscal  these direct costs of the pivotal phase iii trial increased by  or  from fiscal levels 
organizational expansion  benefit costs and science consulting expense also increased from fiscal levels 
we anticipate a continued high level of research and development spending in fiscal following completion of the enrollment stage of our pivotal phase iii trial  we will begin the significant task of data 
table of contents assembly  analysis and reporting to fda 
preparing the biologics license application for polyheme to be submitted to fda will continue through fiscal at the same time  we will be undergoing an extensive process of preparation for fda s review of our manufacturing facility 
northfield s internal research and development resources will be focused on these tasks and we expect to expand the use of external resources to complete the tasks in a timely manner 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year totaled  an increase of  or  from the expenses incurred in the prior fiscal year 
significant increases in professional service fees and public relations expenses occurred during fiscal these expenses were mainly incurred in connection with an informal request from the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  to voluntarily provide certain information relating to the clinical development of polyheme in an elective surgery trial conducted between and we also provided similar information to the staff of the finance committee of the united states senate 
in addition  we incurred expenses for professional services in connection with a putative class action that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal we anticipate significant future increases in our general and administrative expenses resulting from professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with these matters 
we also incurred increased expenses in fiscal for new software installation and our ongoing efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expense for the fiscal year totaled  an increase of  or  from the expense incurred in the prior fiscal year 
the extensive procedural  documentation and testing requirements relating to our internal controls over financial reporting mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of were primarily responsible for a  or  increase in professional services in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate a significant increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the  incurred during fiscal additional legal expenses as well as other professional service costs  such as market research and corporate communications  are being planned 
we also anticipate some expansion in our business organization during fiscal we expect that the total increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal will be between and compared with our general and administrative expenses for fiscal interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  compared to  in fiscal the current year increase is the result of larger available cash resources as well as higher interest rates on our short term investments 
in february  we raised  in net proceeds from an underwritten public stock offering 
these funds are currently invested in short term marketable securities 
available interest rates at the beginning of the current fiscal year were between and for money market investments and for high quality one year securities 
money market rates in july were approximately and high quality three month securities were approaching 
as our current investments mature  they will be rolled over into higher yielding securities until the funds are required for our business 
interest income in fiscal equaled  compared to  in fiscal the fiscal increase is the result of larger available cash resources as well as higher interest rates on short term investments 
with declining available cash resources and short term interest rates perhaps nearing a peak  we anticipate that in the absence of a major cash infusion  interest income will decline in fiscal a one percent rate decline yields  less in interest income on a  investment over a month period 

table of contents net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was primarily the result of increased clinical trial expenses and professional service fees 
the net loss per share increased by only because the average number of shares outstanding in the current fiscal year increased and diluted the increased dollar loss in the current fiscal year 
the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was the result of increased clinical trial expenses and professional service fees 
liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the fiscal years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash utilization is due primarily to increased expenses related to our pivotal phase iii trial 
we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  as previously reported  we have been successful in securing a million federal appropriation as part of the defense appropriation bill in and a million federal appropriation as part of the fiscal defense appropriation bill 
as of may   we have received  of these funds 
we are currently utilizing our cash resources at a rate of approximately million per year 
we expect  however  that the rate at which we utilize of our cash resources will significantly increase over the next two years as we launch our planned commercial manufacturing facility construction project and further expand our business organization in support of product launch 
substantial additional costs will also be incurred during fiscal to complete and submit a bla for polyheme with fda 
based on our current estimates  we believe our existing capital resources will be sufficient to permit us to conduct our operations  including the launch of our planned manufacturing facility construction project and expansion of our manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  for approximately the next to months 
excluding the projected costs relating to our planned facility construction project and expansion activities  we believe our existing capital resources would be sufficient to permit us to conduct our operations  including the preparation and submission of a bla to fda  for approximately to months 
we may in the future issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funds or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
we are also pursuing potential sources of additional government funding 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the results of our clinical trial  as well as general conditions in the business and financial markets 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the timing and results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our planned commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policy reflects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual obligations total one year years lease obligations other obligations total contractual cash obligations the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to three months base rent at any time after february  if the lease is cancelled as of february  unamortized broker commissions of  would also be due 
represents payments required to be made upon termination of employment agreements with two of our executive officers 
the employment contracts renew automatically unless terminated 
figures shown represent compensation payable upon the termination of the employment agreements for reasons other than death  disability  cause or voluntary termination of employment by the executive officer other than for good reason 
additional payments may be required under the employment agreements in connection with a termination of employment of the executive officer following a change in control of northfield 
on june   the company purchased its research and manufacturing facility 
contractual obligations after the purchase are as follows less than contractual obligations total one year years lease obligations other obligations total contractual obligations recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r for the period ending august  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see footnote no 
stock 
table of contents based compensation for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have an impact on our statements of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on its financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease in the interest rate received over a one year period on our cash and marketable securities of  at may  would decrease interest income by
