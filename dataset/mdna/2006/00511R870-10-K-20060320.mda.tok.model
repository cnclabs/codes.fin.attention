the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops new drugs and improved formulations of existing drugs using our proprietary porous microparticle technology 
we are focused on developing proprietary drugs that can offer significant benefits such as improved safety and efficacy  increased patient compliance  greater ease of use  expanded indications or reduced cost 
our three initial product candidates are designed to address large unmet clinical needs within cardiology  oncology and asthma 
our lead product candidate is a cardiovascular drug in phase clinical development for the detection of coronary heart disease  the leading cause of death in the united states 
we created our initial product candidates using technology that enables us to control the size and porosity of particles in a versatile manner  so we can customize the particles to address the delivery needs of a variety of drugs 
we are focused on creating porous microparticles that are smaller than red blood cells 
some of these microparticles are nanoparticles which are smaller than micron 
small microparticles are important for delivering drugs intravenously so that they can pass through the body s smallest blood vessels  for increasing the surface area of a drug so that the drug will dissolve more rapidly  and for delivering drugs to the lung via inhalation 
porosity is important for entrapping gases in microparticles  for controlling the release rate of the drug from a microparticle  and for targeting inhaled drugs to specific regions of the lung 
we have incurred significant operating losses to develop our product candidates and we anticipate continuing to incur significant operating losses in the coming years 
in particular  we expect to incur significant additional expenses and experience other significant capital requirements for the conduct of our phase clinical program for ai and to complete the build out and qualification of a manufacturing facility for the initial commercial manufacture of ai since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities  equipment backed financings and other debt financings 
ai phase clinical trial our phase clinical plan provides for a two part program consisting of a pilot phase the pilot study  under which new investigators and blinded readers have been qualified and trained  and two independent multi center pivotal trials the and trials 
clinical investigators were qualified in the pilot phase on a rolling basis 
the pilot phase was completed in  after which more than clinical investigators were qualified to enroll patients in the pivotal studies 
clinical investigators in the phase pivotal studies are located at clinical sites in north america  europe and australia 
data from the phase pivotal studies are intended for submission to us  european  and potentially other regulatory authorities 
the pilot study 
our objectives in the pilot study were to train and qualify a sufficient number of clinical sites  investigators and blinded readers for transition into one of the two pivotal trials 
these objectives have been accomplished and enrollment in this trial is completed 
clinical sites that were trained in the pilot study transitioned into a pivotal trial when  in our judgment  the clinical site demonstrated that it was prepared to meet the requirements of the clinical trial protocol 
because the pilot study has been conducted for training purposes  there are no defined clinical efficacy endpoints in this study 
the pivotal trials 
as part of the phase pivotal study design  the evaluation of ai enhanced stress echo and nuclear stress images from the pivotal trials is performed by blinded readers who receive no information about the patient being evaluated other than the images 
we have completed blinded reads on more than half the currently enrolled patients in each of the and trials 
during the pivotal trials  we intentionally have no access to efficacy data 
we do not expect to publicly disclose results from either pivotal trial until after the trial is closed  quality control checks are completed  the database is locked  the data are revealed to us and we have had an opportunity to review and understand the data  including data regarding clinical outcomes and safety results 
as of the date of this annual report  over patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease have been enrolled in the phase pivotal trials  including over patients in each of the two concurrently run pivotal studies 
we use statistical models to predict the number of patients we need in each trial to be able to reach statistical significance 
the estimates and assumptions that we are using in our statistical models are primarily derived from our prior clinical studies 
based upon these estimates and assumptions and our statistical analysis plan  we believe that the number of patients that we have enrolled in each of the pivotal studies may be sufficient to achieve statistical significance in these trials 
the trial 
all of the patients enrolled in this trial receive a stress echo study with ai and a nuclear stress test 
patients in this pivotal trial generally undergo coronary angiography only if they have a positive nuclear stress test result 
patients in this pivotal trial who have a negative nuclear stress test result will be evaluated for ninety days thereafter for cardiac events 
the primary endpoints of the trial are sensitivity and specificity relative to a truth standard  in comparison to the performance of nuclear stress testing relative to the same truth standard 
the truth standard for both modalities is determined with angiography  whenever available  or coronary heart disease status with nuclear stress if angiographic data are unavailable 
in december  we ceased enrollment of patients in the trial 
in march  we announced to the clinical sites that we have completed enrollment in this trial 
we have now completed the day follow up period on patients enrolled in this trial 
we anticipate making a public announcement regarding the trial results before the end of the second quarter of the trial 
all of the patients enrolled in this trial receive a stress echo study with ai and undergo coronary angiography 
the majority of patients  but not all  will have a nuclear stress test 
all patients in this trial will be evaluated for up to thirty days following the stress echo study 
the primary endpoints of the trial are sensitivity and specificity  relative to a truth standard  in comparison to nuclear stress testing  with angiography as the truth standard for both modalities 
as of the date of this annual report  and in accordance with the flexibility permitted by our study plan  we are continuing to enroll patients in the trial and anticipate continuing to enroll patients until the end of q we believe that we can continue to enroll patients in the trial through q without delaying our nda filing date as we project that qualification of our commercial manufacturing facility is the rate limiting factor to our nda filing 
our clinical plan  unless otherwise amended  permits us to enroll approximately patients in this study 
once enrollment is closed in this trial and all angiography procedures and the day patient follow up period are completed  we will conduct quality control checks to ensure that all of the required information has been fully gathered and filed and then lock the database 
at that time  the data may be unblinded and available to acusphere for analysis 
we anticipate that this quality control period should be completed within three months of completing the angiography procedures and the post enrollment follow up period and that we will have unblinded data from this trial during the fourth quarter of we anticipate making a public announcement regarding the trial results during the fourth quarter of trial design and purpose 
we believe that stress echo with ai has the potential to significantly reduce the time  cost and resources needed in the assessment of myocardial perfusion  compared to nuclear stress testing 
myocardial perfusion is blood flow to the heart muscle  a sensitive marker for coronary heart disease 
there is no ultrasound contrast agent approved by fda for use in stress echo or myocardial perfusion imaging 
based upon the end points described above  our and trials are designed to demonstrate non inferiority of stress echo with ai relative to nuclear stress testing 
in april  based in part upon feedback from fda  we revised the statistical analysis plan on which we base our patient enrollment estimates for the ai phase clinical trials 
since that time we have continued discussions with the fda regarding trial design and our statistical analysis plan 
as a result of our ongoing discussions with fda  we may make further revisions 
these discussions could lead to delays in the public announcement of the results from our phase clinical trials  change our sample size estimates and affect whether ai is approved for the indication that we are seeking  the timing of such approval or whether ai is approved at all 
the estimates of  patient enrollment requirements and timing of clinical enrollment  blinded reads  data lock  data release and nda filing in our phase trials described above reflect our current assumptions  based on our knowledge and experience and the guidance of our advisors 
we cannot assure you that these timelines will be met  nor can we assure you that our estimates and assumptions will not change based upon ongoing regulatory feedback or that  when the trials are completed  we will successfully achieve results that meet or exceed the clinical endpoints of these phase trials 
ai manufacturing facility update in july  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of commercial manufacturing and office space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
in september  we began to build out the manufacturing space of this facility for commercial manufacturing of ai this manufacturing facility is designed to meet the company s estimated initial commercial demand for ai and to allow for increments in capacity 
we intend to demonstrate that we can produce ai at a commercial manufacturing scale prior to our filing of a nda for ai and  subject to required regulatory approvals  we intend to manufacture ai in this facility for commercial use 
this commercial manufacturing facility must comply with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  enforced by the fda and overseas regulatory agencies 
we have identified potential primary and secondary suppliers of the raw materials used in the production of ai in october  we received an occupancy permit for this commercial manufacturing facility after which operations commenced on site 
by the end of october  most of the procured manufacturing equipment had been subject to start up activities and were placed in service 
the build out of the facility is substantially complete  with minor items remaining to be addressed by the contractor 
facility improvements are being amortized over the remaining initial term of the lease  or approximately five years 
our primary efforts at this facility are currently directed at the substantial work required to qualify equipment and operations in compliance with cgmp s 
completion of such qualification includes significant testing and documentation  including stability studies 
it also requires that we successfully demonstrate that we can produce ai product within specifications which are consistent with the clinical trial material used in our phase clinical program 
we have demonstrated previously that we can produce ai in a qualified manner 
we need to repeat this demonstration in our commercial manufacturing facility prior to filing our nda 
based upon our current plans  we expect to complete this qualification phase by the end of q after which we believe that we will have all of the manufacturing related data necessary to file our nda 
although the build out of the facility is substantially complete  we cannot assure you that we will not encounter complications in the qualification of operations in this facility which complications could add additional costs or delay our filing of a nda for ai european collaboration agreement in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed pursuant to which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market ai in europe 
as part of the agreement  nycomed has agreed to provide up to million in license fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments  including million in payments over the first two years  of which million was received by us prior to december  with the remaining million payment due to us in the remaining million in milestone payments are related to regulatory approvals and achievement of certain sales goals 
in addition  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture ai for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of ai nycomed will be responsible for sales  marketing and the regulatory submissions required for marketing throughout its sales territory  which includes the member states of the european union  as well as russia cis and turkey 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recognized million in revenue derived from our collaboration with nycomed 
in october  the company and nycomed agreed to amend the strategic collaboration agreement in order to accelerate  in milestone payments to support activities associated with ai brand development and related trademark activities 
in february  the company and nycomed agreed to further amend the agreement to accelerate an additional million in milestone payments in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility 
beginning with costs incurred in february  we may begin to draw down on this million in accelerated funding up to  per month 
any payments received pursuant to these amendments are considered advances against a future milestone payment for a european regulatory filing  or marketing authorization application maa  and will be deducted from that milestone payment 
payments received under these amendments will be classified as deferred revenue until the maa milestone is achieved  provided that the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
the nycomed agreement is subject to termination provisions 
under certain of these termination provisions  if we fail in any material respect to use all commercially reasonable efforts to carry out referenced obligations under the agreement  we would be obligated to pay nycomed liquidated damages of up to million 
we plan to carry out all of these obligations  which we believe are in our control 
there can be no assurance that termination of this agreement will not occur or that such termination would not result in us incurring liquidated damages of up to million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception 
in connection with our strategic collaboration agreement with nycomed  as of december  we have cumulatively received million in license fees and research and development payments and we anticipate receiving an additional million in such contractually scheduled research and development payments in in october  we and nycomed agreed to amend the agreement in order to accelerate  in milestone payments to support activities associated with ai brand development and related trademark activities 
this amount has been deferred as of december  in february  the company and nycomed agreed to further amend the agreement to accelerate million in milestone payments in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
we anticipate being paid this million in as the qualification costs are incurred 
any payments received pursuant to these amendments are considered advances against a future milestone payment for a european regulatory filing  or maa  and will be deducted from that milestone payment 
payments received under these amendments will be classified as deferred revenue until the maa milestone is achieved provided that the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
further in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  up front or milestone payments and manufacturing payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our products and intellectual property 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in developing  manufacturing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  costs incurred to validate manufacturing equipment and facilities  costs of contract manufacturing services  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  costs of facilities  legal and other costs of pursuing patent protection on select elements of our intellectual property and stock based compensation 
we expense research and development costs  including patent related costs  as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
development programs for later stage product candidates  such as ai  tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length and the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials for later stage programs and due to costs of scaling production to commercial scale 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock based compensation 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment leases and other financing arrangements 
interest expense also includes interest recognized in connection with embedded derivatives 
change in valuation of derivative 
the terms of our february convertible perferred stock offering and our march mass development loan agreement contain features considered to be embedded derivatives which are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments sfas 
change in valuation of derivative consists of other income expense recognized or incurred on the change in estimated fair value of these derivatives at the end of each reporting period 
the change in the value of the derivative related to the preferred stock is affected by a number of assumptions including the number of preferred shares outstanding  the amount of dividends paid and the probability and timing of conversion into common stock 
the derivative liability is reduced for any make whole payments made during the period upon conversions of preferred stock to common stock 
the change in the value of the derivative related to the loan is affected by the expected timing of future positive net cash flows from operations 
dividends on preferred stock 
for the year ended december   dividends on preferred stock consisted of dividends paid or accumulated on the convertible exchangeable preferred stock which we issued in february dividends on preferred stock exclude any make whole payments on conversion of preferred stock to common stock 
dividends on our preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly on the first day of march  june  september  and december 
any dividend payment must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds that are legally available for dividend payments 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering in  we had outstanding convertible preferred stock which was entitled to accretion of dividends  the amount of which decreased the amount of stockholders equity available to common stockholders and effectively increased the loss per share of common stock 
this preferred stock all converted in common stock in conjunction with the initial public offering 
all preferred stock dividends which were accreted before october  were forfeited by the preferred stockholders on that date in connection with the conversion of these preferred shares to common stock 
results of operations revenue 
collaboration revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and collaboration revenue recognized in collaboration revenue was earned under our agreement with nycomed which was entered into in july under this agreement  excluding any payments that we might receive based upon the achievement of specified milestones  we are scheduled to receive million in license fees and research and development payments through june  of which million was received as of december  we recognize revenue associated with these million in payments ratably over a period of forty two months  representing the estimated development period over which such fees are earned 
in addition  in october  nycomed agreed to amend our agreement and paid us  to fund certain activities associated with creating a brand name for ai and related trademark activities 
this amount has been deferred as of december  research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the million increase in over represented an increase of and the million increase in over represented an increase of 
included in the increase in research and development expense in is million that we expensed in connection with our acquisition of patents from schering 
the remaining million increase during in research and development expense is primarily due to a million increase in direct costs  including a million increase in salaries related to increased staffing levels  a million increase in consulting and contract services and a million increase in materials and supplies 
these increases are primarily due to activities relating to ai  including increased phase clinical program costs and increased costs associated with preparing for commercial manufacturing of ai the increases reflect costs associated with a higher number of clinical sites enrolling patients in the ai phase clinical program  a higher rate of patient enrollment in these clinical trials and related increases in costs for clinical data management and independent clinical site monitoring 
the increase in research and development costs also includes increased costs associated with increasing full and part time personnel and operating costs associated with efforts to build out and qualify a commercial manufacturing facility for ai the higher research and development expense in compared to primarily resulted from increased activities in the ai phase clinical program  including clinical site costs  data management costs  independent monitoring costs and costs of manufacturing clinical materials 
the increase in research and development costs also includes costs associated with increasing full and part time personnel 
the increase in research and development costs in compared to primarily resulted from costs associated with the start of our phase clinical program for ai  including increased costs associated with clinical site training and clinical site monitoring 
the increase in research and development costs in compared to also includes increases in indirect costs 
these increases included a million charge under the schering patent transfer agreement and increased facility and depreciation costs resulting primarily from the lease agreement entered into in the company s commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts and the depreciation of improvements to that facility and equipment installed in that facility the majority of which went into service in october the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands ai ai and ai other direct costs total direct costs indirect costs facility costs depreciation stock based compensation schering patent transfer costs other patent costs total indirect costs total research and development expense research and development costs generally increase as programs progress from early stage clinical trials to late stage clinical trials 
our primary research and development programs are as follows late stage clinical development program ai 
our lead product candidate  ai  which is a cardiovascular drug designed for the detection of coronary heart disease 
we incurred direct research and development expense for ai in of million  million in and million in of these amounts  million in  million in and million in were related to materials and manufacturing  validation  quality assurance and quality control costs  including million in contract manufacturing costs in patient enrollment in the phase clinical program for ai are anticipated to decline in as we completed enrollment in the trial in december and we seek to complete enrollment in the trial during  however  costs associated with clinical data management and evaluation  as well as regulatory affairs costs and increased costs associated with qualifying our commercial manufacturing facility for ai in tewksbury  massachusetts  including depreciation costs on assets placed in service in late  are likely to offset all or most of the potential expense savings in from reduced patient enrollment costs 
early stage clinical development programs ai and ai 
our initial clinical applications of our hdds technology  ai  and our pdds technology  ai  have each completed a phase trial 
during  we prioritized our clinical spending to ai and incurred no clinical costs on ai or ai in late  we commenced a feasibility study regarding the use of our hdds technology in connection with a product candidate under development by a larger pharmaceutical company 
that company is reimbursing us for the cost of the study 
in we anticipate other direct costs of early stage development programs to increase 
the amount of such increase will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in commencing new feasibility studies with partners for our hdds and pdds technologies  if at all  whether such studies result in subsequent development work funded by potential partners  the amount of funding provided by such current and potential partners  staffing levels available to support such projects and the extent to which we elect to pursue a development of hdds or pdds product candidates with our own resources 
other 
other direct research and development costs primarily consist of management and preclinical evaluation of other product candidates 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals  which are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research and development programs  particularly our early stage programs  must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
failure to commercialize these product candidates on a timely basis could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek to establish collaborative relationships to help us commercialize these product candidates  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense in the year ended december  was million  compared to million for and million for the million increase in over represented an increase of while the million increase in over represented an increase of 
the increase in general and administrative expense in both and were principally due to additional personnel  consultants and increased costs for investor relations  business development and other activities 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands direct costs indirect costs facility costs depreciation stock based compensation total indirect costs total general and administrative expense we anticipate some overall increase in general and administrative expense  including increases in costs for investor relations and business development activities 
we intend to continue to incur various internal and external business development costs to support our various product development efforts  and certain of these expenses are likely to increase overall 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense for the year ended december  was million of net income  compared to  of net income in and million of net expense in the million increase in net income in over represented an increase of and the million increase in net income in over represented an increase of 
during these years  interest and other income expense consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands interest income other income interest expense change in valuation of derivative total  net the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to higher average fund balances available for investment resulting from the million preferred stock financing in february and the million common stock offering completed in september the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to higher average fund balances available for investing resulting from funds received for the initial public officering in october and the million private placement completed in october the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily related to increased borrowings under our two equipment financing lines and non cash interest accretion charges of  related to the schering patent agreement 
the interest expense was partially offset by the capitalization of interest associated with the build out of our tewksbury facility 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to interest costs associated with bridge loans of million  interest paid on subordinated loans payable of  and amortization of the discount of  in compared to zero in change in valuation of derivative 
the change in valuation of derivative amounted to  in the increase in change in valuation of derivative was related to the embedded derivative instrument from the dividend make whole payment feature of the preferred stock offering that closed in february we determined the initial fair value of the dividend make whole payment feature to be million at february  the commitment date 
as of december   the derivative liability was valued at million 
during  the company distributed  shares of its common stock with a fair value of million in satisfaction of the make whole provision related to the conversion of  shares of preferred stock into common stock 
effect of preferred stock on loss available to common stockholders 
our net loss available to common stockholders includes dividends paid as well as dividends accumulated on preferred stock 
the accumulated portion represents one month of dividend accumulated but not declared as of the end of the period 
this amount of dividends accumulated is included in the calculation of per share net loss available to common stockholders 
in  dividends paid or accumulated on preferred stock totaled million compared to zero in the increase in dividends on preferred stock results from the issuance on february  of  shares of exchangeable preferred stock 
during  million in dividends were paid in cash to holders of this preferred stock 
during  certain of the shares of preferred stock were voluntarily converted into common stock such that at december   shares of preferred stock were outstanding 
in february  the board of directors declared a dividend on the shares of preferred stock outstanding as of february  this dividend  which totaled million was paid on march  in addition to dividends paid on preferred stock  the calculation of per share net loss available to common stockholders includes million of dividends accumulated on preferred stock representing one month of dividend accumulated but not declared as of december  in  there was no accretion of dividends on preferred stock because all previously outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted to common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering in october in  in connection with this conversion of preferred stock to common stock  all previously accreted dividends on the convertible preferred stock were forfeited by the holders 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through the issuance of equity securities  debt financings and equipment leases and  more recently  with funds from our collaboration with nycomed 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from research and development expenditures  equipment expenditures and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of december  we owed  from capital leases and million from notes payable and other long term obligations 
we also had operating lease commitments totaling million for rent of our facilities 
during the year ended december   operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities during this period resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase  net of amortization  in deferred revenue of million  primarily from payments received from nycomed  a non cash write off of intellectual property of million  net of million paid in under the schering patent transfer agreement  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and an increase of million in accrued expenses 
in we anticipate that our cash spending from operating activities will be higher than in during quarters in which we continue to enroll patients 
we estimate cash spending from operations during to approximate to million per quarter during trial enrollment  with a reduction once clinical trial enrollment is concluded 
during the year ended december   investing activities used million in cash 
this use of cash was primarily used for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvement costs incurred in connection with the build out of our commercial manufacturing facility for ai because the build out of that facility was substantially completed in  we anticipate equipment and leasehold improvement costs in will be substantially less than in based upon our current plans  we estimate purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements in to be approximately to million in excess of current outstanding purchase orders of  we intend to seek financing for under additional equipment financing lines 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million in cash 
net cash provided by financing activities during this period resulted primarily from the net proceeds of a redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in february of million  net proceeds of a common stock financing in september of million and from borrowings under equipment financing lines of million  net of repayments under those lines 
these funding activities were partially offset by the payment of dividends during on the redeemable convertible preferred stock of million 
in september  we sold  shares of its common stock at per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
in june  we entered into a million equipment financing line with oxford finance corporation oxford 
borrowings under this equipment line can be made against qualified purchases  subject to review and approval by oxford  through april borrowings are collateralized by qualified purchases and repaid over to months depending on the nature of the equipment financed 
the equipment line is structured as a loan agreement with interest rates fixed at the time of each borrowing based on the us federal reserve s three year and four year treasury constant maturity rates 
interest rates on borrowings made through december  under this line range from to  respectively 
loan amounts are subject to acceleration upon the happening of certain customary events of default including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
we have cumulatively borrowed million under this line during  of which million was outstanding at december  the loans under this line are secured by certain equipment in our watertown and tewksbury facilities 
in march  we borrowed million under a loan agreement with massdevelopment to help finance certain tenant improvements to our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
interest accrues under the loan at per annum with retroactive adjustments to upon our reaching certain defined earning levels 
the repayment of principal and accrued interest will coincide with the term of the tewksbury lease which has a five year  nine month term with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms 
no payments are due under the loan for the first twenty four months 
unpaid interest during this twenty four month period shall be accrued and principal and interest shall be repaid on a monthly basis thereafter such that the total amount outstanding shall fully amortize over the balance of the term in equal installments 
the loan is subject to acceleration upon certain customary events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
the loan is secured by certain of the tenant improvements made at the tewksbury facility 
on february   we issued  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock at per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
each share of preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly on the first day of march  june  september  and december 
any dividends must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds that are legally available for dividend payments 
during  the company paid million in dividends on our preferred stock 
as of december    shares of preferred stock were outstanding 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on the preferred stock for all holders as of february  this dividend  which totaled  in aggregate  was paid on march  we may elect to automatically convert some or all of the preferred stock into shares of our common stock if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded per share of the conversion price for at least trading days during any day trading period  ending within five trading days prior to notice of automatic conversion 
prior to march   if we elect to automatically convert  or if any holder elects to voluntarily convert  the preferred stock  we will also make an additional payment  the make whole payment  equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have been payable on the preferred stock so converted from the original date of issuance through and including march   less any dividends already paid on the preferred stock 
this additional payment is payable by us  at our option  in cash  in additional shares of its common stock  or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
we have reserved a maximum of approximately million shares of common stock for issuance under this make whole provision 
as of december    shares of preferred stock had been voluntarily converted into  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with such conversions  we issued an additional  shares of the company s common stock in satisfaction of the required make whole payment 
we may elect to redeem the preferred stock at declining redemption prices on or after march  the preferred stock is exchangeable  in whole but not in part  at our option on any dividend payment date beginning on march  the exchange date for our convertible subordinated debentures debentures at the rate of principal amount of debentures for each share of preferred stock 
the debentures  if issued  will mature years after the exchange date and have terms substantially similar to those of the preferred stock 
in october  we completed the second and final closing of a million private financing  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
in july we completed the first closing of this financing 
in the combined closings of the financing we issued to institutional and accredited investors an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in april  we entered into an equipment financing line with general electric capital corporation 
in and  the company borrowed an aggregate of million against this line 
as of december   net of repayments  we had million outstanding under this line 
such borrowings are collateralized by corresponding equipment and other capital purchases with repayment due in monthly installments over to months  depending on the nature of the equipment financed  with the last such repayment scheduled for march interest rates on these borrowings were fixed at the time of each borrowing and range from to 
no further additional amount may be borrowed under this line 
the loans under this line are subject to acceleration upon the happening of certain customary events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed in which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market ai in europe 
under the original terms of this agreement  nycomed paid us license fees and research and development payments totaling million in and million in nycomed is scheduled to pay us an additional million in research and development payments in the original agreement also provides for nycomed to pay to us up to million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones and sales goals 
under the agreement  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture ai for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of ai in october  our agreement with nycomed was amended such that nycomed paid us an additional  in for activities associated with creating a brand name for ai and related trademark activities which amount decreased by  the potential in milestone payments which may be earned under the agreement 
in february  the company and nycomed agreed to further amend the agreement to accelerate million in milestone payments in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
we anticipate being paid this million in as the qualification costs are incurred 
any payments received pursuant to these amendments are considered advances against a future milestone payment for a european regulatory filing  or maa  and will be deducted from that milestone payment 
in connection with our original agreement with nycomed  we are obligated to pay a customary fee to our financial advisor 
the fee is comprised of cash and warrants 
the total amount of cash payments is dependent upon the timing and magnitude of the amounts paid to us by nycomed 
in and  we paid our advisor  and  respectively  in connection with this transaction 
on november   in connection with the nycomed transaction  we issued a warrant to our financial advisor to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in july  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
this lease has a five year  nine month term with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms at predetermined rental rates 
initially  we will receive nine months of occupancy free of base rent  followed by base rent of approximately  for the next twelve months with scheduled annual rental rate increases thereafter 
in october  we paid an initial security deposit of million to the landlord as part of the lease  subject to reduction if we make certain tenant improvements and upon the installation of equipment in the facility 
in august  we entered into a million loan agreement with the massachusetts development finance agency  the economic development authority of the commonwealth of massachusetts  to help fund tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
financing is available under this loan agreement upon completion by us of certain tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
the term of this facility  if utilized  is expected to coincide with the term of the tewksbury lease 
as of december   no borrowings had been made under this loan agreement 
we believe  based on our operating plans  that our existing resources  including scheduled proceeds from nycomed  will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including spending necessary to complete enrollment in our ai phase clinical program into early  or longer if we elect to reduce our rate of spending 
unless we reduce our current rate of spending  we will require significant additional funds  which we may raise through public or private sales of equity  or from borrowings  or from strategic partners 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical trials and the size and timing of creating expanded manufacturing capabilities 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  patent licenses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues for ai  other than possible license or milestone payments  unless or until we or current or potential partners complete clinical trials and receive marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities 
allowing our resources to become depleted may make future funding more difficult or expensive 
when additional funds are required or  in advance of such requirements  we anticipate that funds will be needed  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings or from strategic partners or we may delay funding of certain development activities which could delay the filing of our ai nda and the commercialization of ai which would have a materially adverse impact on our growth plans 
we are evaluating our funding alternatives  additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business  and strategic partnerships may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development 
shelf registration statement we have on file with the us securities and exchange commission sec a universal shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
which provides for the offer  from time to time  of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants up to an aggregate of million 
this shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec on april  as of the filing of this report  the shelf registration statement remains effective and  subject to market conditions and our capital needs  and so long as we are then eligible to use the registration statement under sec rules  we may again seek to use any remaining availability under the shelf registration statement by making an offering of securities covered for sale under the registration statement 
in addition  we may amend our shelf registration statement or file a new shelf registration statement to increase our potential access to capital 
if we elect to raise additional capital using a shelf registration statement  we may use the net proceeds from the sale of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include funding clinical trials  research and development  regulatory activities and the qualification of our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts  acquisitions  including acquisitions of companies  products  intellectual property or other technology  repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness  investments  capital expenditures  repurchase of our capital stock and for any other purposes that we may specify in any prospectus supplement 
our management has broad discretion in the use of net proceeds and could spend net proceeds in ways with which our shareholders may not agree and in ways that do not necessarily improve our operating results or the value of our common stock 
the existence of this shelf registration statement is not intended to be indicative of any particular financing plan by us 
if and when we pursue additional financing through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  this shelf registration statement is intended to help facilitate such transactions 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total obligations all years through through after in thousands capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations notes payable including interest intellectual property acquisition cost obligations purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements total contractual cash obligations our operating lease obligations relate to our facility leases 
as of december   we have entered into purchase orders for capital equipment and leasehold improvements which total approximately million 
against these purchase orders we have paid approximately million in deposits 
the table above reflects the remaining amounts due on these purchase orders 
in  we anticipate expenditures for equipment purchases totaling approximately to million in excess of the above reflected amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
we recognize revenue from license arrangements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and fasb emerging issue task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenue from license payments not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
the period over which we are obligated to perform services is estimated based on available facts and circumstances 
we recognize revenue from performance payments  when such performance is substantially in our control and when we believe that completion of such performance is reasonably probable  ratably over the period over which we estimate that we will perform such performance obligations 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone when performance of such milestone is contingent on performance by others or for which achievement can not be reasonably estimated or assured  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  provided that there is no substantial future service obligation associated with the milestone 
we do not recognize revenue in connection with license arrangements until payments are collected or due and reasonably assured of being collected 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue in circumstances where the arrangement includes a refund provision until the refund condition is no longer applicable unless  in our judgment  the refund circumstances are within our operating control and unlikely to occur 
payments received in advance of being recognized as revenue are deferred 
we are recognizing collaboration revenue of million associated with the initial license and performance based payments under the nycomed agreement based on an estimated recognition period of forty two months over which we are obligated to perform services supporting the agreement and assumes that ai will be ready for commercialization before the end of this estimated recognition period may change if available facts and circumstances change 
were the estimated development period to be extended  we would record a reduction in cumulative revenue recognized in our statement of operations in the period in which the change in development period is determined 
our agreement with nycomed has been modified such that nycomed has paid us  for activities associated with creating a brand name for ai and related trademark activities and to reimburse us for up to million for support of activities to support the validation of the our commercial manufacturing facility for ai these amounts were originally scheduled to be paid to us upon nycomed s filing for regulatory approval of ai in europe 
while the amounts are not refundable  we plan to defer recognition of these amounts until after the original regulatory filing milestone has been achieved 
payments received for current and potential hdds and pdds feasibility studies  which are offset by costs incurred for such studies  are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of each such study 
a change in these estimates could result in a significant change to the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
in addition  if the nycomed collaboration agreement is terminated for reasons other than certain non performance by us  we would recognize the remainder of the payments we have received or otherwise expect to collect over the amortization period at the time of termination 
we will not recognize revenue associated with the potential additional million in milestone based payments that may be earned under the nycomed agreement until the underlying regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 
fixed assets 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives of three to five years using the straight line method 
the majority of our equipment is related to our ongoing research and development activities  including equipment which  subject to regulatory approvals  we intended to use for commercial manufacture of ai we consider that this equipment is placed in service when operation of the equipment is started up and begin depreciating the equipment at this time 
the equipment in our commercial manufacturing facility is currently undergoing research and development related activities that result in wear and tear on the equipment including include ongoing calibration and testing 
leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases are recorded at cost 
we depreciate leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases over the lesser of their useful lives or the remainder of their respective lease terms 
during periods of leasehold build out  we record such costs and construction in progress and do not begin depreciation of such costs until the improvements are substantially completed and available for use 
we began depreciation of leasehold improvements at our tewksbury facility in october upon receipt of an occupancy permit and taking occupancy of the facility 
our leasehold improvements costs on this facility approximate million and are being depreciated ratably over remaining term of our present lease which is scheduled in expire in april we believe that the use of the original term of the lease for the depreciation period  rather than assuming that the lease term is renewed  is appropriate given the inherent uncertainties with a product such as ai  which has not yet completed its phase clinical trials and requires regulatory approvals before it can be marketed 
the risk factors included under section a of this document discuss the uncertainties associated with ai accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  and contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to the engineering and construction management contractor used in the build out of our commercial manufacturing facility for ai in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
stock based compensation and other equity instruments 
we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we have not recorded stock based compensation expense for stock options issued to employees in fixed amounts with exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
for those stock options that were granted at less than fair market value  are recorded as expense in the financial statements 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on january  using the statement s modified prospective application method 
we do not yet have an estimate of the effect on our statements of operations of adopting sfas no 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we account for transactions in which we grant warrants in connection with the issuance of debt in accordance with apb  accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
the two factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb no 
 apb no 
 sfas no 
and eitf no 
requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can be readily estimated  we use the value of such goods or services to determine the fair value of the equity instruments 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can not be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees or non employees  we estimated the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deemed to be relevant at the time using cost  market and or income approaches to such valuations 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering in october  market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include i comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  ii pricing of private sales of our convertible preferred stock  iii prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  iv economic trends  v perspective provided by investment banks and vi the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
derivative liabilities 
the terms of our february convertible preferred stock offering and our march massdevelopment loan agreement contain features considered to be embedded derivatives which are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments sfas 
the estimation of this fair value includes various assumptions and estimates  including assumptions and estimates of risk free interest rates  stock price volatility and the timing of future preferred stock conversions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can increase or decrease the value of this derivative liability 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are included in other income expense 
the convertible preferred stock terms include a dividend make whole payment provision  which has been initially recorded at its estimated fair value 
this derivative liability is reduced upon conversion of the preferred stock as well as dividends declared by our board of directors  if any 
the massdevelopment loan agreement includes a provision for a retroactive interest rate increase in the event that we achieve certain defined positive operating cash flows 
the initial fair value of the massdevelopment loan derivative is being amortized over a term beginning with the loan agreement effective date and ending with the estimated payment date of the retroactive interest 
the fair value of both derivative liabilities are re measured at each reporting period 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire through we also have research and development credit carryforwards of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of significant changes in ownership interest  as defined 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
in  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r using the statement s modified prospective application method 
while we believe the adoption of this standard will cause our annual compensation costs to increase  we have not yet estimated the amount of additional operating expense which will need to be recorded in upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and government grade securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of one year or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
our equipment loans and capital leases are not subject to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rates are fixed at the time of borrowing 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
