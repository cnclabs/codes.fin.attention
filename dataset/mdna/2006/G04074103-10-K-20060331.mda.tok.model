item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of apex silver mines limited and the selected financial data and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
apex silver is a mining exploration and development company that holds a portfolio of silver and other mineral exploration and development properties primarily in latin america 
we currently focus our resources primarily on the development and financing of our san cristobal project in bolivia 
at present  none of our properties are in production and  consequently  we have no current operating income or cash flow 
overview we made significant progress in on the construction of our san cristobal project in bolivia with expenditures of approximately million on equipment procurement  plant construction  infrastructure development  engineering and other costs  including approximately million of accrued costs 
at the end of  approximately of the engineering on the project had been completed and we expect the remaining engineering to be completed during the first half of procurement of major equipment commenced during and some of the major equipment components  including the sag and ball mills and flotation cells  have been delivered to the project site 
we expect substantially all of the concrete will be poured during the first quarter of and most of the major equipment will be installed in during  we completed construction of roads connecting the project with the chilean border and with the town of uyuni 
we also initiated development of a nearby well field in order to provide water for the project 
construction on the power line commenced during and we expect that the line will be completed and power will be available during the second half of at december  the project was estimated to be approximately completed and is continuing to track within budget and on time 
we anticipate commencement of production at the project in the second half of during we finalized agreements with service providers including the mining contractor  the rail transport company  the power provider and the port facilities provider 
at december  we have open contractual commitments of approximately million related to these agreements and other material and equipment orders 
in the third quarter we commenced certain activities at the san cristobal project including certain earthworks and plant construction that fall within the scope of our asset retirement plan and as such will require future reclamation and closure expenditures 
as a result we recorded an asset retirement obligation of million during the period 
prior to the third quarter there were no activities that would require future reclamation and closure expenditures 
we signed a million project finance facility to complete the development of our san cristobal project in december and borrowed a total of million under the facility in february and march the facility  arranged by barclays capital and bnp paribas  was funded by a group of international financial institutions including banks  export credit agencies and the andean development corporation  a multilateral financial agency that promotes sustainable development in south america 
we believe that the funds available under this facility along with existing cash and investment balances will be adequate to complete the san cristobal project and provide adequate working capital 
certain covenants related to the project finance facility required us to provide price protection for a portion of the planned production of metals from san cristobal 
during the third quarter  we entered into contracts utilizing forward sales  purchased puts and calls sold to comply with the bank price protection covenants 
in order to maintain leverage to silver market prices  we entered into proportionally more zinc and lead contracts than silver 
these derivative positions represent  and of planned life of mine payable production of silver  zinc and lead  respectively 
during september and october we completed the purchase for cancellation of million and million of our and convertible senior subordinated notes due  respectively  by issuing million of our ordinary shares valued at million 
in addition  during january and february we issued an additional million ordinary shares valued at million and paid million of cash for accrued interest to complete the purchase of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes 
the company canceled the notes purchased in the transactions 
results of operations exploration 
our exploration expenses  including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ending december  and respectively 
the increase in exploration costs during and as compared to is primarily the result of our increased exploration activities in peru  mexico  argentina and bolivia outside of san cristobal 
the amount includes million for the value of ordinary shares issued to consultants to acquire mineral rights 
none of the exploration expenses reported relate to san cristobal 
administrative 
administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
the administrative expenses included approximately million of one time non cash compensation expense primarily associated with the retirement of the company s chairman and a million one time payment made to a consultant related to the convertible note offerings completed during the increase in administrative expense during as compared to excluding million of non recurring expenses is primarily the result of additional personnel and related indirect support costs associated with the advancement of our san cristobal project and our project financing efforts 
the increase in administrative expense during and as compared to is primarily the result of additional personnel and related indirect support costs associated with the advancement of our san cristobal project  our project financing efforts and sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition to the non cash compensation expense discussed above  we recognized non cash compensation expense of million and million  net of amounts capitalized  during and respectively resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas no 
 during no such amounts were recognized during interest and other income 
our interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase as compared to and is the result of the increased interest we earned on the higher average cash balances that we held resulting from the proceeds received from the ordinary share and convertible debt offerings completed during as well as the higher average interest rates we received during the period 
the increase compared to is the result of interest earned on the higher cash balances we held during the period resulting from the proceeds received from the ordinary share and convertible debt offerings completed during gains and losses commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december  we recorded non cash  mark to market losses related to our metals derivative open positions in the amount of million compared to mark to market gains of million and million on our open positions for the years ended december  and respectively 
the loss is the result of the non cash mark to market valuation of our open metals positions at december  related to the project finance facility requirement to provide price protection for a portion of our planned production of metals from san cristobal 
the recent increases in the spot and forward prices for silver  zinc and lead resulted in the million non cash mark to market loss for the year 
the loss did not have an impact on our cash flows or cash position for the period 
further  while the final financial impact of the required price protection program will not be known until the positions are closed on their future settlement dates  the company does not intend to settle the open positions with cash prior to the settlement dates beginning in at that time  previously recognized cumulative non cash mark to market gains or losses will be offset against the final market settlement amount 
in addition  should the increased metals price projections used to calculate the non cash mark to market loss continue into the production phase of the san cristobal project  the increased revenue from metals sales for which price protection was not required would generate a significant benefit to future earnings and cash flows 
our open metals derivative positions for the years ended december  and were substantially smaller prior to the lending requirements as reflected in the smaller non cash mark to market gains of million and million for the respective years 
during the periods that the metal derivative positions are outstanding  gains and losses may fluctuate substantially from period to period in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
interest and other borrowing costs 
for the year ended december  we recorded million of expense for interest and amortized borrowing cost compared to million for the year ended december  and no interest or borrowing costs for the year end december  the increase is the result of greater average outstanding debt balances during and million of accelerated amortization of deferred borrowing costs recorded related to the extinguishment of a portion of the debt during the year 
the interest and other borrowing costs consisted of interest paid on the and convertible senior subordinated notes due  which were issued in  and interest paid on capital leases 
the interest and other borrowing costs were related to the and convertible senior subordinated notes due we had no outstanding interest bearing debt during the year ended december  in addition to the amounts expensed we capitalized million and million of interest and other borrowing costs during the years ended december  and respectively 
income taxes 
apex silver mines corporation  our us management services company  is subject to us income taxes on income derived from services provided to apex silver mines limited and its subsidiaries 
other than amounts payable by apex silver mines corporation  we pay no income tax in the us since we are incorporated in the cayman islands and do not conduct or expect to conduct business in the us that would generate us taxable income 
the cayman islands currently impose no corporate taxation 
we have been granted an exemption until january  from any form of corporate taxation that may subsequently be adopted in the cayman islands 
for the year ended december  the company recorded million of income tax expense related to withholding taxes on certain investments and taxes incurred related to services we provided to a bolivian subsidiary 
no such taxes were incurred during the years ended december  and deferred tax assets of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  resulting from operating loss carry forwards of our subsidiaries  have been entirely offset by valuation allowances 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our aggregate cash  short term investments and long term investments totaled million compared to an aggregate of million in cash  short term investments and long term investments at december  the amounts held at december  included million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million of restricted cash and million of short and long term restricted investments 
the restricted cash included million to provide collateral for the price protection required in connection with our project finance facility  million set aside to collateralize outstanding letters of credit  million to collateralize our discretionary metals trading program and million to provide for certain requirements related to the port facilities 
at december  the restricted investments consisted of million that at maturity will provide the amounts necessary to pay interest on the convertible senior subordinated notes through and million of investments placed in escrow to provide over run funding for the san cristobal project should an overrun occur 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash during is the result of million invested in property  plant and equipment related to the development of the san cristobal project  million used to fund operations  property holding costs and administrative costs  net of interest and other income  million paid to the banks related to the project finance facility  a net increase in restricted cash of million  payment on long term debt capital lease payments of million  million of net premiums paid to acquire derivatives related to our hedge position  million advanced to construct the port facility and million of advances made to suppliers all partially offset by the net sales of million of investments  million of net proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares to fund the power line construction and million of proceeds from employee stock options exercised 
our estimate for the total amount of project funding required for the san cristobal project from january  through the beginning of production in is approximately million 
this amount includes all estimated costs required to commence production at san cristobal  including all engineering  procurement and construction costs  as well as estimates for constant dollar escalation and contingencies 
the estimate excludes million to be advanced to the company constructing the power line  million to be advanced to the company constructing the port facilities and million of working capital 
approximately million was advanced to the power line company by issuing apex silver ordinary shares during and the beginning of we have also paid million of the million to be advanced to the port company and have placed the remaining million in escrow for the benefit of the port company 
advances to the power line and port facility providers are expected to be recouped through credits applied against payments for the contracted services 
including the power line and port advances  we spent approximately million on the project during and approximately million in in addition to the amounts above  we expect to incur direct financing costs of approximately million 
in years prior to  we spent approximately million in project capital at san cristobal  which is not included in the million estimate described above 
we signed a million project finance facility to complete the development of our san cristobal project in december and borrowed million under the facility in february and march we believe that the funds available under this facility along with existing cash and investment balances will be adequate to complete the san cristobal project and provide adequate working capital 
in we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which at december  would allow us to sell up to million in any combination of equity or debt securities as described in the registration statement in one or more offerings 
during we expect to spend approximately million on equipment procurement  plant construction  infrastructure development  engineering and other costs related to our san cristobal project 
we plan to fund these project expenditures with the proceeds from the million project finance facility and million of cash and investments that we placed in a san cristobal project escrow account in february use of the funds placed in the escrow account is restricted for the development of the san cristobal project per the terms of the project finance facility 
in addition  in order to maintain our current portfolio of exploration properties  we expect to make lease  patent and option payments during the next twelve months of about million 
we expect discretionary spending of up to million on exploration 
total administrative expenses are expected to be approximately million during and interest earned from investments and other income should approximate million 
while we believe our existing cash and investment balances will be adequate to fund these requirements  we may access the capital markets for additional funding should the need arise 
off balance sheet arrangements our convertible senior subordinated notes due have several embedded derivatives which we have determined have no value 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter thousands debt   interest payments due on debt     capital leases      interest payments on capital leases     operating leases  san cristobal property leases   purchase obligations   other gaap liabilities the debt and interest payments due on debt are related to the and convertible senior subordinated notes due total interest payments due on debt includes only those payments expected to be made through based on our expectation that the holders may require us to repurchase the notes in the operating lease obligations are related to the office facilities at our corporate headquarters 
the san cristobal property lease payments are payments the company must make to the bolivian government to maintain its rights to the san cristobal mining concessions 
the purchase obligations are related to orders placed for long lead time equipment being purchased for the san cristobal project 
from time to time we enter into lease option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us 
these agreements typically contain escalating lease payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property 
such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and the agreements can be terminated by us at any time 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
you should also read note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements are affected by estimates that we  or experts that we have retained  have made as to our proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates involve subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions that may later prove to be inaccurate 
these estimates include engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  changes in the market prices of metals may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
our current proven and probable reserve estimates at san cristobal total approximately million tonnes of ore grading grams per tonne silver  zinc and lead  containing approximately million ounces of silver  billion pounds of zinc and billion pounds of lead 
the reserves are based on a per ounce silver  per pound zinc and per pound lead 
these prices represent the three year average prices for each of the metals as per guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
to complete the project financing on san cristobal we were required to hedge a portion of our planned production 
in addition  when san cristobal enters production  we may sell forward an additional portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we measure the fair value of open positions at each reporting period and record the difference in the carrying value to current earnings  in accordance with fas under fas  fair value measurements may vary substantially from period to period based on spot prices  forward prices and quoted option volatilities 
upon meeting all documentation and measurement criteria  we may in the future apply hedge accounting to certain of our metals derivative positions as defined by fas item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relatively low exposure to currency fluctuations 
during we placed an order for certain long lead equipment related to the san cristobal project 
the purchase price of the equipment was denominated in euros 
to partially offset the potential deterioration of the us dollar relative to the euro  we entered into a foreign currency collar transaction utilizing puts and calls 
during the years ended december  and the company recognized mark to market gains losses related to the transaction of approximately million and million respectively with a net realized gain of approximately million 
because we conduct our activities in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in additional hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
to complete the project financing for san cristobal  we were required to hedge a portion of our planned production from san cristobal 
in addition  when san cristobal enters production  we may sell forward a portion of our production and use price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuating metals prices 
we recorded a non cash mark to market trading loss for the year ended december  of approximately million
