operating segments in connection with the company s acquisition of lenox  the company redefined its operating segments to include three reportable segments wholesale  retail and direct 
although the product produced and sold for each segment is similar  the type of customer for the product and the method used to distribute the product are different 
as a result of the lenox acquisition  the company is in the process of combining and integrating the lenox and department business operations into these segments 
the segmentation of these operations also reflects how the company currently reviews the results of these operations 
financial data for the last three fiscal years by segment is set forth in detail in the management discussion and analysis section of this annual report on form k and in note within the notes to consolidated financial statements

based upon historical rates  the company expects approximately of the order backlog as of december  to ship in fiscal and the remainder to be cancelled 
approximately of the wholesale segment s sales are to one customer  namely macy s home store  the entity that represents the combination  through a merger in  of federated department stores and the may department stores company

on september   the company approved certain consolidation plans for the lenox subsidiary  including the closing of lenox retail stores 
such plans for consolidation were contemplated in conjunction with the acquisition on lenox 
as of january   the company completed the implementation of this store closing plan  leaving lenox retail stores in operation 
this segment experiences no significant unfilled orders and is not dependent on a single customer or group of customers

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company recorded time to celebrate s results in continuing operations until the run off of operations was completed in the fourth quarter of the time to celebrate results have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
manufacturing sourcing the company owns and operates two manufacturing facilities in the united states 
the company manufactures its lenox branded  fine china dinnerware at its plant located in kinston  nc 
sterling silver flatware under the gorham and kirk stieff brand names is manufactured at the company s pomona  nj facility 
clay and feldspar are the principal raw materials used to manufacture china products 
gold and platinum are significant raw materials used to decorate china products 
sand  potash and lead are used in the manufacture of crystal products 
fine silver is the principal raw material used to manufacture sterling flatware products and steel is the principal raw material used to manufacture stainless steel flatware 
the company anticipates that these raw materials will be in adequate supply 
however  the acquisition price of gold  platinum  fine silver  and steel is influenced significantly by worldwide economic events and commodity trading 
the company also sources product from external manufacturers 
of the total value of product sourced in  was imported from abroad  primarily from manufacturing sources located in the pacific rim area including the people s republic of china china  indonesia  thailand and the philippines 
the company also imports a portion of its products from sources in india and europe 
distribution the imported products sold by the company to its wholesale customers  direct response customers and through its company owned retail stores are generally shipped by ocean freight from abroad and then by rail or truck to the company s distribution centers located in hagerstown  md  langhorne  pa and rogers  mn

table of contents seasonality the company records its highest wholesale sales during the third and fourth quarters of each year as wholesale customers stock merchandise in anticipation of the holiday season 
in addition  the company records its highest retail and consumer direct sales in the fourth quarter during the peak holiday shopping season 
however  the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly sales and related net income compared with the prior year due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by customers 
the extended payment terms that the company provides to some of its wholesale customers create a significant seasonal pattern in its accounts receivable requirements 
due to the seasonal pattern of shipping and accounts receivable collection  the company generally has greater working capital needs in its second and third quarters and experiences greater cash availability in its first and fourth quarters 
the company typically finances its operations through short term seasonal borrowings 
competition the company competes generally for the discretionary income of consumers with other producers of tabletop  collectibles  specialty giftware and home decorative accessory products 
these areas are affected by  among other things  changing consumer tastes and interests  changing consumer shopping habits  consolidation of channels of distribution and the shift in supply to asian sources of manufacture 
the tabletop giftware industry is highly competitive  with a large number of both large and small participants 
the company s competitors distribute their products through their company owned retail stores  independent gift retailers  department stores  mass market and specialty chain stores  televised home shopping networks  internet commerce and mail order houses  and through the home show sales method or other direct response marketing methods 
the company believes that the principal elements of competition in the tabletop specialty giftware industry are design  brand loyalty  quality  display and price 
the company believes that its competitive position is enhanced by a variety of factors  including the design  uniqueness  quality and enduring themes of the company s products  its in house design expertise  its reputation among retailers and consumers  its sourcing and marketing capabilities  and the pricing of its products

risk factors our business faces many risks 
any of the risks discussed below  or elsewhere in this annual report on form k or in our other sec filings  could have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our sales could be negatively impacted if our key customer substantially reduces orders for our products 
with the exception of our largest account  macy s home stores  our customer base is relatively dispersed 
our sales to this large account  which was formed in as the result of a merger between federated department stores and the may department stores company accounted for of our net sales for fiscal year reflecting four months of lenox results 
if we lose macy s home stores as an account  our sales and business would be negatively impacted 
the company s reliance on foreign manufacturing is subject to inherent risk  which may affect our ability to procure goods and or procure them in a timely fashion 
foreign manufacturing and procurement of imports is subject to the following inherent risks labor  economic and political instability  cost and capacity fluctuations and delays in transportation  dockage and material handling  restrictive actions by governments  nationalizations  the laws and policies of the united states affecting importation of goods including duties  quota and taxes  international political  military and terrorist developments  and foreign trade and tax laws 
moreover  we cannot predict what relevant political  legal or regulatory changes may occur  or the type or amount of any financial impact on the company such changes may have in the future 
our products are subject to customs duties and regulations pertaining to the importation of goods 
in the ordinary course of business  we may be involved in disputes with the us bureau of customs and border protection us customs regarding the amount of duty to be paid  the value of merchandise to be reported or other customs regulations  which may result in the payment of additional duties and or penalties  or in the refund of duties to the company 
since the terrorist attacks of september   us customs has enacted various security protocols affecting the importation of goods 
such protocols could adversely affect the speed or cost involved in the company s receipt of inventory from its overseas vendors 

table of contents the company s reliance on manufacturing from sources within china  in particular  is subject to inherent risk  which may affect our ability to procure goods and or procure them in a timely fashion 
in fiscal year  approximately of our imports were manufactured in china  and we anticipate that such percentage will hold constant or increase for the foreseeable future 
china has joined the world trade organization and been accorded permanent normal trade relations status by the us government 
however  various commercial and legal practices in china  including the handling of intellectual property and certain labor practices  are under review by the us government 
china has been designated a country of particular concern cpc pursuant to the international religious freedom act of irfa 
the irfa enumerates several specific retaliatory actions that may be taken by the us government  none of which we believe would have a material impact on our business 
the irfa  however  also accords the president broad discretion in fashioning other or additional actions and  due to the breadth of the presidential powers under the irfa  we are unable to predict what  if any  action the president could take in the future 
accordingly  the ability to continue to conduct business with vendors located in china is subject to political uncertainties  the financial impact of which we are unable to estimate 
to the extent china may have its exports or transaction of business with us persons subject to political retaliation  the cost of chinese imports could increase significantly and or the ability to import goods from china may be materially impaired 
in such an event  there could be an adverse effect on the company until alternative arrangements for the manufacture of our products were obtained on economic  production and operational terms at least as favorable as those currently in effect 
we are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates present risks inherent in our method for inventory procurement 
our costs could be adversely affected if the currencies of other countries in which we source product appreciate significantly relative to the us dollar 
this could result  for example  from a decision by china to revalue the renminbi rnb relative to the us dollar or to allow the rnb to float instead of being pegged to the us dollar at a fixed rate 
the company monitors this risk carefully 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase  our financial results would be negatively affected 
a principal market risk affecting the company is the exposure to changes in the interest rates on our variable rate debt 
as the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on an annual basis 
the company monitors this risk carefully 
we may encounter litigation that has a material impact on our business 
the company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
trends in litigation may include claims brought by consumers  shareholders  vendors  accounts and or injured persons in cases relating to antitrust  employment and labor  environmental  negligence and regulatory matters 
litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect the company s financial results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strategic overview excluding the acquisition of lenox  the company s financial results for as well as the two prior years were significantly impacted by fundamental changes occurring in the gift and specialty account base 
in  the company continued to see substantial attrition of the gift and specialty channel  which accounted for over of the company s wholesale sales 
in addition to this account attrition  on going accounts have cut back on ordering the company s village product 
due to both account attrition and reduced village sales with on going gift and specialty dealers  village product revenue decreased in  which was consistent with the longer term trend 
in response to the changing nature of the gift and specialty channel  the company implemented two strategies designed not only to offset the decline of the village business but to grow revenues long term 
these strategies were expanding the company s channels of distribution outside its traditional gift and specialty channel  and expanding the company s product offering to include year round gift products 
these strategies were pursued both organically  by building upon the company s strengths in design and product development to enter new channels and categories  and through acquisition 
these strategies are explained in more detail below 
expanding channels of distribution wholesale channels the company has adopted a multi channel wholesale approach to better expose its products and make them more accessible to a broader range of new consumers 
new  simpler and less costly villages  as well as giftware lines were sold to select merchandise chains including sears and lowe s 
retail stores the company operated six department retail stores in to showcase the breadth of its home decorative and celebratory products 
these stores are situated in high traffic locations where there is no significant wholesale distribution 
the company plans to open three additional stores in  although appropriate sites have not yet been identified 
expand product offering to include year round gift products this strategy is to expand the company s product offering and reposition the company from a strong  yet highly seasonal christmas collectibles business to a company providing premier home decorative products to celebrate life s extraordinary moments throughout the year

the company s cash and cash equivalents declined from million at january  to million at december  due primarily to financing the acquisition on september  consistent with customary practice in the giftware industry  the company offers extended payment terms to some of its wholesale customers

in addition  the company has pledged the common stock of its subsidiaries  direct and indirect  as collateral under the credit facilities  and the company and its material subsidiaries  direct and indirect  have guaranteed repayment of amounts borrowed under the credit facilities

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of the company s results of operations and financial position sales returns and credits an allowance is established for credits related to possible returned or damaged product  markdowns and pricing and shipping discrepancies 
the amount of the allowance is based on historical ratios of credits to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the credit  and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience  changes in product damage or defect rates  or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
based on sales and returns and credits including such returns and credits from the acquisition from its effective date thru december   a increase or decrease in sales returns and credits would have had an impact of approximately million 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the amount is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
the company procures product based on forecasted sales volume 
if actual sales were significantly lower than forecasted sales due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions  it could result in materially higher surplus and discontinued inventories 
based on inventory write downs including such write downs from the acquisition from its effective date thru december   a increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of less than million 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable based on an evaluation of its accounts receivable balance 
this evaluation includes a number of factors including the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  the current business environment  and the historical collection experience for customers and consumers of similar background and nature 
additionally  since many of the company s wholesale sales have dating terms which come due in november and december  the company does not have visibility into overdue balances for most of its wholesale customers until the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
due to the seasonality of the company s business  the extended dating terms provided to wholesale customers and the relative size of accounts receivable balances at year end  it is not uncommon for the company to experience fluctuations in the provision for bad debt expense from quarter to quarter as the company refines its estimate 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
in addition  results could be materially different if economic conditions worsened for the company s customers 
based on bad debt write offs including such write offs from the acquisition from its effective date thru december   a increase or decrease in bad debt write offs would have had an impact of less than million 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of these assets based  in part  upon projections of anticipated undiscounted cash flows 
management undertakes this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge recorded reduces earnings 
while the company believes future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets within which the company operates could affect evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
valuation of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets on a periodic basis 
this evaluation relies on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change  the company may be required to recognize impairment charges 
pension and postretirement benefits the company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans as well as postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits 
benefits are based on such factors as years of service and compensation level during employment 
the benefits expected to be paid are expensed over the employee s expected service 
to determine the expected benefits to be paid  the company has to make assumptions regarding interest rates  return on plan assets  the rate of salary increases  and expected health care trend rates 
actual experience different from these assumptions could result in materially different benefit payments 
tax contingencies the company is periodically contacted or audited by federal and state tax authorities 
these contacts or audits include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  the company records a reserve for estimated probable exposures 
the estimate of this reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposure associated with its various filing positions 
to the extent the company does not have to pay taxes for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves  the company s tax rate in a given financial period could be materially impacted 
subsequent event on march   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with willitts designs international  inc willitts to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of willitts 
the purchase price will be equal to the historical cost of the assets acquired less the obligations assumed as of the closing date 
the net purchase price is estimated to be approximately million 
in addition to the purchase price  the company may be required to make additional payments contingent on performance through

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to market risk contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the information presented has been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to management 
given the unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the company s interest rate risk relates to its debt outstanding 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as a result of this variable interest rate debt  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on an annual basis 
less than of the company s wholesale sales and less than of the company s sourced product purchases in fiscal year were denominated in a foreign currency 
based on these sales and product purchases  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates would have an impact of less than million 
at this time  the company does not use derivative instruments to manage the exchange rate risk
