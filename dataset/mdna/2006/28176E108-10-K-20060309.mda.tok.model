investment impairments in september  the company recorded an million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in sangamo biosciences  inc sangamo 
the investment was written down to million  which represented the quoted market price of sangamo s common stock at september  the company considered numerous facts  including those described below  to conclude that any impairment of the sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in and  and the first two quarters of sangamo s key internally established development milestones were progressing and or remained on track at each quarter end throughout and  and the first two quarters of there were no changes in technology that could impair sangamo s earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook 
the company believed that the number and scope of sangamo s programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the company s sangamo related programs would significantly drive the value of sangamo 
moreover  the clinical momentum was building at the end of with the anticipation of three to four phase i human trials  the likely completion of one or more phase i trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings 
management of the company believed that declines in sangamo s stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector  and not sangamo specific activities 
in addition  the company recognized that  historically  reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period 
management believed this would be the case for sangamo 
throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary  sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year

a summary of all of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  were as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations a contractual development obligations b total contractual cash obligations a unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of minimum purchase commitments of inventory 
b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that edwards lifesciences is obligated to pay to unconsolidated affiliates upon their achievement of product development milestones 
while it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made  the amounts and maturity dates included in this table reflect the company s best estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for sales when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company enters into certain arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements to its customers 
revenue related to an individual element is deferred unless delivery of the element represents a separate earnings process 
total revenue for these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the fair value of the individual elements  with the relative fair values determined based on objective evidence generally based on sales of the individual element to other third parties 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for charge backs  rebates  returns  and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  or damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable 
the related costs are amortized over the remaining useful lives of the patents using the straight line method 
such deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement  costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
since the adoption of sfas no 
 the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  management reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term  strategic equity investments in companies that are in varied stages of development 
certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
various methods are used to estimate fair value  including discounted cash flows 
investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded at the amount of the company s investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid 
when the fair value of any investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
income taxes the company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates 
to the extent the company s estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
additional information regarding income taxes is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million  partially offset by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance of million as of december   reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain investments and the net operating loss carryforwards of certain united states and non united states subsidiaries 
the company evaluates annually the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
employee stock option and stock purchase plans the company applies the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its fixed stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
in accordance with this intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recognized for these plans 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition by recording a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no

the company is not required to prepare financial statements in accordance with sfas no

r  classification of stock based compensation cost  capitalization of compensation cost  and disclosure requirements 
the company has selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for the awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
however  uncertainties  including the company s future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense that the company will incur in future periods will be similar to the sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps  option based products and forward currency contracts 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amounts of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements  option based products  and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the company s exposure through its use of derivatives 
interest rate risk the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis 
the company s interest rate swap agreements involve agreements to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate  at specified intervals  calculated on an agreed upon notional amount 
there were no interest rate swaps in effect as of december  as part of its overall risk management program the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately percent of the company s weighted average interest rate affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments  would have an immaterial effect on the company s annual interest expense 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
option based products consist of purchased put options and  at times  written sold call options to create collars 
option based products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive  or require the company to make payments at  specified currency rate levels 
as part of its risk management process  the company uses a value at risk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation  with a percent confidence level and a day holding period  to estimate this potential loss 
the company s calculated var at december  and  with a maturity of up to one year  is million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances 
the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case 
any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures  there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future 
credit risk derivative financial instruments used by the company involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in the event a counter party should default and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations 
credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines  counter party diversification  monitoring of counter party financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counter parties 
credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december  reduced by the effects of master netting agreements 
additionally  at december   all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of aa or better by national rating agencies 
the company does not anticipate non performance by its counter parties and has no reserves related to non performance as of december   the company has not experienced any counterparty default during the five years ended december  concentrations of credit risk in the normal course of business  edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry  performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses 
in  the company had no customers that represent greater than of its total net sales or accounts receivable  net 
investment risk edwards lifesciences is exposed to investment risks related to changes in the fair values of its investments 
the company invests in equity instruments of public and private companies 
these investments are classified in investments in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   edwards lifesciences had approximately million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized losses of million on these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
management considers these declines temporary in nature based upon the individual companies operating results  financial condition and achievement of product development milestones 
should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones  the decline in the investments values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary
