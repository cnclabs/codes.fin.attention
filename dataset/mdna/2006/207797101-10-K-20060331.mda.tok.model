item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading forward looking information 
part i item business the company the registrant  connecticut water service  inc referred to as the company  we or our was organized in connecticut water service  inc is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its ten wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in  approximately of the company s earnings from continuing operations were attributable to water activities carried out within its three connecticut regulated water companies the connecticut water company connecticut water  the crystal water company of danielson crystal  and the unionville water company unionville 
these three companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout connecticut 
each of these companies is subject to state regulation regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues  and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns seven unregulated companies chester realty  inc  a real estate company in connecticut  new england water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services  connecticut water emergency services  inc  a provider of drinking water by tanker truck  crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns crystal water and three small rental properties  barlaco inc barlaco  a real estate company in massachusetts  the barnstable holding company  a holding company which owns barnstable water and barlaco and the barnstable water company barnstable water  a company that was a public service company until its assets were sold to the town of barnstable in as a result of the sale of the assets of barnstable water  results of its operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
in  these unregulated companies  in conjunction with the regulated water companies  contributed the remaining of the company s earnings from continuing operations through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals 
our mission is to provide high quality water service to our customers at a fair return to our stockholders while maintaining a work environment that attracts  retains and motivates our employees to achieve a high level of performance 
our corporate headquarters are located at west main street  clinton  connecticut our telephone number is  and our internet address is www

at this time  the company has applied in february docket to the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc  to merge all of its connecticut based  regulated utilities with and into connecticut water 
on march   the dpuc issued a draft decision which would approve this merger 
if  and when  these combinations are completed  the resulting entity  connecticut water  would consist of the current subsidiaries crystal  unionville  and connecticut water 
it is expected that future rate relief applications would propose rate 
table of contents equalization steps  which  if approved would result  over time  in equalized rates for the company s customers in connecticut 
the company believes it is likely that it will apply for a rate increase for connecticut water  after the completion of the merger  during the summer of the company s annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  proxy statements and all amendments to these documents will be made available free of charge through the investor info sec filings section of the company s internet website http www

the demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers high water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers 
demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season  particularly during the warmer months 
in general  the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions 
in addition  profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as costs to comply with security  environmental  and water quality regulations 
inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction  materials and personnel related expenses 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
since the enactment of the safe drinking water act  we have spent approximately  in constructing facilities and conducting aquifer mapping necessary to comply with the requirements of the safe drinking water act  and other federal and state regulations  of which  was expended in the last five years 
we are presently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 

table of contents our water companies derive their rights and franchises to operate from special state acts that are subject to alteration  amendment or repeal and do not grant us exclusive rights to our service areas 
our franchises are free from burdensome restrictions  are unlimited as to time  and authorize us to sell potable water in all the towns we now serve 
there is the possibility that the state of connecticut could attempt to revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems 
while we would vigorously oppose any such attempts  from time to time such legislation is contemplated 
the rates we charge our water customers are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by a state regulatory agency 
it is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return 
the following table shows information related to each of our water companies most recent general rate filing 
year of last allowed allowed rate return on return on decision equity rate base connecticut water crystal unionville n a unionville s rates were based on a return on equity methodology  not a rate base methodology 
beginning mid  unionville began imposing a surcharge on its customers water bills to recover financing and operating costs related to the construction and use of a water interconnection with a neighboring water supplier 
annually the surcharge is subject to a retroactive refund to ratepayers if total revenue for unionville exceeds certain stipulated amounts 
to date  we have not been required to provide any such refunds 
our water systems our water infrastructure consists of noncontiguous water systems in the state of connecticut 
our system  in total  consists of approximately  miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of billion gallons 
the safe  dependable yield from our active wells and reservoirs is approximately million gallons per day 
water sources vary among the individual systems  but overall approximately of the total dependable yield comes from reservoirs and from wells 
we supply water  and in most cases  fire protection to all or portions of towns in connecticut 
the following table lists the customer count  operating revenues and customer water consumption for each of our water companies as of december  number water customer water of revenues consumption water company customers s millions of gallons connecticut water crystal unionville total 
table of contents the following table breaks down the above total figures by customer class water customer water number of revenues consumption customer class customers s millions of gallons residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total our water companies own various small  discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes 
at december   this land totaled approximately acres 
over the past years we have been slowly disposing of such excess land 
the largest transaction to date has been the donation of land by crystal to the town of killingly  ct for protected open space purposes over a three year period  in january  the final parcel of land was transferred to the town 
over the three year period the following acreage was donated to the town under this agreement year acres after tax profit during  the company lowered the after tax profit shown above by  this was due to an ongoing audit by the internal revenue service  which is examining the fair market value of the property reflected on the company s  and tax returns 
the company continues to believe the valuations used in those tax years filings are correct 
during  the company had one significant land transaction 
connecticut water sold acres of land in bristol  connecticut for  resulting in a net profit of  in december  connecticut water made a donation of approximately acres of land to the town of plymouth  ct for a new school 
as a result of legislation passed in  this donation was eligible for the connecticut corporate tax credit in the same manner as a donation for open space purposes 
the after tax profit from this transaction was  in  this amount was increased by  primarily due to a higher valuation reflected on the company s tax return as a result of an updated appraisal 

table of contents we also have a limited amount of land held by our unregulated companies 
included in this category at december  was approximately acres of land held by barlaco  which we acquired in february in conjunction with the company s acquisition of the barnstable holding company 
in february  this land was sold to the town of barnstable for million 
additional information on land dispositions can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operation commitments and contingencies 
competition our water companies face competition  presently not material  from a few private water systems operating within  or adjacent to  their franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our water companies franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
on april   the company was notified by the national labor relations board  nlrb that the international union of operating engineers  local union had petitioned the nlrb to organize a vote by the company s employees to authorize the union to represent a portion of the company s employees for purposes of collective bargaining with the company 
a representation hearing was conducted before the nlrb on april  in hartford  ct 
a vote concerning representation by the union of the company s employees eligible to be in the proposed bargaining unit was held on may  a majority of the ballots cast were against the labor organization  therefore no collective bargaining representative was selected 
segments of our business for management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three business segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of all our regulated companies with the exception of real estate transactions and services and rental activities 
our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our limited excess real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by either our regulated or unregulated companies 
a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows 
table of contents gain loss from real estate transactions net of taxes from continuing operations regulated unregulated total our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties 
both our regulated and unregulated companies offer these transactions 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from telecommunication antennas placed on our water storage tanks by telecommunication companies  as well as from the renting of residential and commercial property 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan and antenna leases  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while relatively new and a small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provides nearly percent of our overall net income 
the table below describes the net income generated by this segment of our business from our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years income from services and rentals from continuing operations regulated unregulated total item a 
risk factors because we incur annually significant capital expenditures  we depend on the rates we charge our customers 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses 
once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the timing of our rate increase requests are therefore partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process 
table of contents in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase to the extent approved 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase request will be approved by the dpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in total compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
potential drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers uses of water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage 
table of contents during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including in the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous 
table of contents substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ensuing threats to the nation s health and security  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its ten wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in  approximately of the company s earnings from continuing operations were attributable to water activities carried out within its three regulated water companies connecticut water  crystal  and unionville 
the rates charged for service by these regulated water companies are subject to regulation by the connecticut dpuc 
in  virtually all water activity income came from connecticut water  our largest subsidiary and water company 
connecticut water has not had an increase in its rates since primarily due to the construction of six major water treatment plants during the late s and throughout the s  our overall investment in gross utility plant increased by  or  from to  which resulted in our water rates being amongst the highest in connecticut 
in  we began developing opportunities to increase revenues and earnings without raising regulated water rates 
through these efforts we have successfully until  increased our consolidated earnings each year since without increasing water rates  and  continued increasing our common dividend payments per share during this period 
for the first time since  a regulated subsidiary of the company increased its rates  effective december  during the year  gallup water service  inc gallup was merged with and into crystal prior to the filing of an application for rate increase for the newly merged company 
in december  crystal was granted an across the board rate increase of 
we expect to seek regulatory approval to increase rates charged in all of our connecticut regulated water companies in the summer of the material factors that have driven our decision to file for a rate increase in are increases in infrastructure investment necessary to insure a safe  reliable water system remains in place  modest historical and projected annual growth in regulated water sales of approximately  and  increases in operating costs such as utilities  wage  pension  medical  audit and insurance costs 
on a year to year basis our earnings are primarily influenced by weather patterns that affect our customers water usage and thereby our revenues 
our revenues may fluctuate by as much as million or above or below a normal year because customers use more water in hot  dry years and less water in cool  rainy years 

table of contents regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
our water companies are also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
our water companies ability to recover their increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the regulatory rates they charge their customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the appropriate regulatory authority through formal rate proceedings 
the rates of our three connecticut based water companies are regulated by the connecticut dpuc 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that our water companies will be able to raise their rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise their rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
the company currently plans to merge all of its connecticut subsidiaries into one company  connecticut water 
further  the company expects to apply for a rate increase in the summer of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation statement of financial accounting standards financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation fas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as the company s water companies to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fas material regulatory assets are earning a return 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on quarterly or monthly meter readings plus an estimate of water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
the unbilled revenue amount is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet 
the amount recorded as unbilled revenue is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
based upon historical experience  management believes the company s estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 
pension plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of pension expense we record in a given period 
our and pension expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension expense will be calculated with an assumed discount rate of 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension expense increase decrease in expense a increase in the discount rate a decrease in the discount rate outlook the company s earnings and profitability are primarily dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the company s earnings and profitability in future years will also depend upon a number of other factors  such as the ability to maintain our operating costs at lower levels  customer growth in the company s core regulated water utility business  growth in revenues attributable to non water sales operations  and the timing and adequacy of rate relief if and when requested  from time to time  by our regulated water companies 
the company believes that the factors described above and those described in detail below under the heading commitments and contingencies may have significant impact  either alone or in the aggregate  on the company s earnings and profitability in fiscal years and beyond 
please also review carefully the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors and described below under the heading forward looking information 
based on the company s current projections  the company believes that its net income from continuing operations for the year  excluding the gain from the sale of barlaco assets in february  will be materially reduced from the levels reported for the years  and any such reductions would likely be primarily attributable to lower net income in the form of reduced tax benefits related to the company s land disposition program  excluding the barlaco land sale 
since the sale of the assets of barnstable  the results of operations for 
table of contents barnstable are included in discontinued operations  including any income earned under the management contract 
in addition  the regulated water company subsidiaries increased operating costs  including depreciation on their investments in utility plant  will require the company s primary subsidiary  the connecticut water company  to seek rate relief in based upon appropriate recovery of these costs in a timely manner based upon a rate increase application expected to be filed in the summer of  and taking into account the other factors discussed impacting profitability and earnings  the company believes that its net income should return to levels achieved in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover costs in an appropriate and timely manner in during and subsequent years  the ability of the company to maintain and increase its net income comparable to historical levels will principally depend upon the effect on the company of the factors described above in this outlook section  those factors described in the section entitled commitments and contingencies and the risks and uncertainties described in forward looking information  including the company s plan to file for rate relief during financial condition liquidity and capital resources in recent years  we have financed the majority of investment in utility plant through internally generated funds 
in november two of our regulated subsidiaries  connecticut water and crystal issued million and million respectively of year long term debt 
the following table shows the total construction expenditures excluding non cash contributed utility plant for each of the last three years and what we expect to invest on construction projects in construction gross funded by construction construction developers funded by expenditures others company projected we currently fund our working capital requirements through our lines of credit with four banks  which provide liquidity to satisfy ongoing cash needs 
we consider the current aggregate  lines of credit to be adequate to finance any expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise in all the lines have one year lives and will expire on different dates in we expect to renew the lines in the interest rates payable are variable and fluctuate over time based on financial conditions 
the weighted average interest rate on the  aggregate balance outstanding at december  was 
during  interest rates fell to historically low levels 
we took advantage of the low rates and refinanced a portion of our long term debt in the fourth quarter of in october  connecticut water borrowed million from the issuance of water facilities refunding revenue bonds by the connecticut development authority the authority 
the bonds were sold in two series with the following terms 
table of contents a series  non amt maturing c series  amt maturing the proceeds of the transaction were used to redeem the series r and s first mortgage bonds of connecticut water and paid for a portion of the expenses associated with the issuance 
during the first quarter of  connecticut water refinanced an additional portion of its long term debt through the issuance of  of variable rate  taxable debenture bonds series with a maturity date of january  the bonds were secured by an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by a financial institution  with a five year term expiring in march the proceeds of the sale of the bonds  which are general debt obligations of connecticut water  were used to redeem the  aggregate principal amount of connecticut water s first mortgage bonds series v and to pay a portion of the expenses associated with the bonds refunding 
in connection with the issuance of the bonds  connecticut water entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a counterparty in the notional principal amount of  the interest rate swap agreement provides that  beginning in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  connecticut water will pay the counterparty a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount for a period of five years 
in exchange  the counterparty began in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  paying connecticut water a floating interest rate based on of the us dollar one month libor rate on the notional amount for a period of five years 
the purpose of the interest rate swap is to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
in june  unionville secured million through the drinking water state revolving fund for costs incurred in developing a water interconnection with a neighboring water supplier
