risk factors 
application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  those financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial  corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized indirect costs and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we defer the application and origination fees  net of costs  and recognize them as revenue  along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guaranty provided to the investor 
the guaranty fair value is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guaranty 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction 
inventories are recorded at cost  unless they are determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventories are written down to fair value less cost to sell in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventories include capitalized interest  real estate taxes and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
consolidated inventory not owned 
we enter into land option agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of houses in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity  the company s deposit including letters of credit represents a variable interest in the entity  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include the amount of the deposit in relation to the fair value of the land  expected timing of our purchase of the land and assumptions about projected cash flows 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution or sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
certain of these entities have been determined to meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they lack sufficient equity to finance their operations  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
certain of these entities have been determined to not meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they have sufficient equity and have obtained outside financing  and we must use our judgment to determine if we have a controlling interest in the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
based on the application of our accounting policies  these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
guarantees and indemnities 
guaranty and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guaranty or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guaranty on loans sold to certain third parties  and estimates its actual liability related to the guaranty  and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase  based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guaranties and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including environmental indemnifications  guaranties of the completion of land development and minimum net worth guaranties of certain subsidiaries 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guaranties and indemnifications could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals for warranties under our two year limited warranty program and our year pre and year structural warranty program are established as a percentage of average sales price and on a per unit basis  respectively  and are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  which considers both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for pre existing warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience  and are also due to differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ materially from our currently estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  up to  per claim per year 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
derivative financial instruments 
the company has the following types of derivative financial instruments mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments 
mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property 
all mortgage loans are committed to third party investors at the date of funding and are typically sold to such investors within two weeks of funding 
the commitments associated with funded loans are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the related loans 
accordingly  changes in the value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings  as are changes in the value of the loans 
the net gain or loss is included in financial services revenue 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  the company classifies and accounts for irlcs as non designated derivative instruments at fair value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlc loans through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value  with gains or losses recorded in current earnings 
results of operations the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance on a consolidated basis and by evaluating our two segments  homebuilding operations and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operations include the development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding operations include similar operations in several geographic regions that have been aggregated for segment reporting purposes 
the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services for purchasers of the company s homes 
in conformity with sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
eliminations consist of fees paid by the homebuilding operations relating to loan origination and title fees for its homebuyers that are included in financial services revenue  the homebuilding segment s housing costs include these fees paid to financial services 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s chief operating decision makers made a decision to change how the total business was viewed to include corporate and other  previously shown separately within the company s segment reporting  within the homebuilding segment 
the chief operating decision makers made this change because they believe this is a better way to view the company s results  and will also provide more comparable information with the homebuilding industry 
as required under sfas  the company has restated all prior period segment information to be consistent with the segment reporting 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  homes delivered declined compared to  from  in to  in the decline in homes delivered was due to softness in our midwest markets  lower community counts going into and delays in our florida markets caused by weather  longer regulatory processes and shortages in certain materials and labor 
we anticipate homes delivered to be approximately  with the growth being driven entirely by our markets outside the midwest 
total revenue for increased over to billion 
housing revenue increased due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in land revenue increased million  primarily as a result of lots sold to third parties in tampa  orlando  columbus and washington  dc during in addition  during  our homebuilding operations recognized million of revenue related to the change in home closings with low down payment loans that were not yet sold to a third party  whereas the impact to revenue for resulted in a million reduction in revenue 
our financial services revenue declined million compared to the prior year due to fewer loan originations and lower gains on the sale of loans to third parties resulting from the change in mix of loans sold 
for  approximately of our operating income was derived from operations in our columbus market  compared to approximately for we anticipate that this percentage will continue to decline during as a higher percentage of our homes delivered are expected in markets outside of columbus 
in  we anticipate that a significant portion of our operating income will be derived from our florida markets 
income before income taxes for increased million and over  driven by the increase in revenue described above  partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage in compared to in  along with a increase in general and administrative expenses and a increase in interest expense 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to land related expenses associated with our growth and diversification activities  including real estate taxes  homeowner s association fees for active communities and additional personnel costs  totaling approximately million 
also in  we expensed certain deposits and costs totaling million on land transactions where the return potential had declined from the initial evaluation or certain contingencies were not satisfied 
additionally  the increase was due to the absence in of million of income relating to interest rate swaps that terminated in september partially offsetting these higher general and administrative costs was the absence in of million of expense recorded in s general and administrative expense relating to the redemption of our million senior notes 
the million increase in interest expense was the result of higher weighted average borrowings and a slightly higher weighted average interest rate  partially offset by an increase in interest capitalized due to an increase in land under development and backlog 
in  we anticipate gross margins could decline approximately basis points due primarily to incentives being offered in our midwest markets  along with a normalization of margins in our florida and washington  dc markets 
s new contracts of  were down compared to  in market conditions in the midwest  where our new contracts were down  along with certain weather and permitting related delays we experienced during in opening new communities  resulted in lower than anticipated new contracts 
our goal for new contracts continues to be an annual increase of approximately 
as a result of lower refinance volume for outside lenders  we expect to experience continued pressure on our mortgage company s capture rate  which was approximately during and during this could negatively affect earnings 
we continue to focus on our land position and purchased million of land in  including our july acquisition of a private homebuilder in florida 
over of those purchases were in markets outside the midwest 
we continue to increase our land position in our florida  north carolina and washington  dc markets  where we expect our future growth to be primarily generated 
we currently expect to purchase approximately million of land in  including land purchases by unconsolidated limited liability companies that we hold an interest in 
during  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april the proceeds from this offering were used to pay down our existing revolving bank borrowings 
we believe this issuance provided us with long term strategic capital at an attractive cost and increases the flexibility for our financing needs 
our effective tax rate was for compared to for the reduction was primarily a result of the manufacturing credit established by the american jobs creation act 
the decrease is also due to a change in the state of ohio s tax laws  which phases out the ohio income tax and replaces it with a gross receipts tax  which is classified as general and administrative expense 
we do not expect this change in ohio s tax laws to have a material impact on our cash flows 
in addition  we had a favorable resolution of certain state related tax matters during we currently estimate our effective rate to be approximately 
we expect our net income to be impacted by approximately million of expense  net of tax  associated with equity compensation that must begin being expensed under new accounting standards effective january  highlights and trends for the year ended december  our revenue increase of over was driven by a increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  along with a increase in the number of homes delivered 
income before taxes increase of over was driven by the revenue increase above combined with a slight improvement in homebuilding margins from to  resulting from additional house options being sold that carry higher margins along with cost efficiencies in land development 
additionally  our financial services operations generated million higher income than in  of which nearly million was the result of the increase in ownership of one of our title companies 
partially offsetting these increases were million higher warranty costs due mainly to a change in estimate for our year structural warranty  million of costs incurred relating to the florida hurricanes  million costs incurred for the early termination of our million senior subordinated notes  and million higher interest costs due to an increase in borrowings 
we spent approximately million on land purchases during during  we also increased the amount of land held under option agreement by million  an increase of

in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations 
the following table reflects this cycle for the company during the four quarters of and three months ended december  september  june  march  dollars in thousands unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited revenue unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period three months ended december  september  june  march  unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited revenue unit data new contracts homes delivered backlog at end of period homebuilding operations as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  the company s chief operating decision makers made a decision to change how the total business was viewed to include corporate and other  previously shown separately within the company s segment reporting  within the homebuilding segment 
this homebuilding segment change also resulted in a change in the components within homebuilding 
housing revenue represents revenue generated from the delivery of homes to homebuyers  land revenue consists of the sale of land and lots to external parties and other revenue consists of revenue related to the timing of homes delivered with low down payment loans buyers put less than down funded by the company s financial services operations  not yet sold to a third party 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  recognition of such sales must be deferred until the related loan is sold to a third party

homes delivered represents homes for which the closing of the sale has occurred 
backlog represents homes for which the standard sales contract has been executed  but which are not included in homes delivered because closings for these homes have not yet occurred as of the end of the period specified 
most cancellations of contracts for homes in backlog occur because customers cannot qualify for financing and usually occur prior to the start of construction 
the cancellation rate was approximately in each of the years ended december   and unsold speculative homes  which are in various stages of construction  totaled  and at december   and  respectively  with related dollar investment of million  million and million  respectively 
during  the company increased its investment in unsold speculative homes  primarily in the midwest region  for competitive purposes and to provide potential homebuyers with more flexibility and the ability to see certain options in our homes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the homebuilding segment was billion  an increase of and million from this increase was due to an increase in housing revenue million  a increase in land revenue million and a million increase in revenue related to the timing of homes delivered with low down payment loans buyers put less than down funded by the company s financial services operations  not yet sold to a third party 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  recognition of such sales must be deferred until the related loan is sold to a third party 
the increase in housing revenue was due to an increase of in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  with our north carolina and washington  dc region up and increases in all of our other markets except west palm beach 
the number of homes delivered declined from  to  primarily as a result of an expected decline in the midwest ohio and indiana  where deliveries were down due to softness of the economy 
the million increase in land revenue was due primarily to third party sales of lots in tampa  orlando  columbus and washington  dc  which had million of revenue in compared to million in in these markets 
land revenue can vary significantly from period to period  given that management opportunistically determines the particular land or lots to be sold directly to third parties 
home sales and backlog 
new contracts decreased in  from  to  however  the mix of new contracts changed  with an decline in the midwest being offset by increases in florida  north carolina and washington  dc the number of new contracts recorded in future periods will be dependent on numerous factors  including future economic conditions  timing of land acquisitions and development  consumer confidence  number of communities and interest rates available to potential homebuyers 
at december   our backlog consisted of  homes  with an approximate sales value of million  with backlog sales value in our florida markets up compared to december  this overall increase in backlog represents a increase in units and a increase in sales value from december  the average sales price of homes in backlog increased by  with increases occurring in most of our markets 
this increase in the average sales price of homes in backlog is attributable partially to the overall increase in sales prices of our new contracts due to customers selecting more options  along with the mix of homes in backlog at the end of the quarter including more homes than the prior year within our florida and washington  dc markets  where our homes generally carry higher sales prices than in our midwest region 
gross margin 
the gross margin for the homebuilding segment was for  a slight increase from the gross margin in housing gross margin increased from to and land gross margin increased from to 
the increase in housing s gross margin was driven by improved gross margins in our florida and washington  dc markets  along with the impact of the geographical mix of homes delivered in our various markets  partially offset by an expected decrease in gross margins in the midwest due to economic factors 
land gross margins can vary significantly depending on the sales price  the cost of the community and the stage of development in which the sale takes place 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million and of revenue during to million and of revenue in the increase was primarily due to land related expenses associated with our growth and diversification activities totaling million  including a million increase in payroll related costs  million increase in real estate taxes and homeowner s association fees related to having more raw land and more active communities than in  and million increase in architectural expenses associated with new product designs 
also in  we expensed certain deposits and costs totaling million on land transactions where the return potential had declined from the initial evaluation or certain contingencies were not satisfied 
in addition  our acquisition of shamrock on july  resulted in an additional million of general and administrative expenses  including million amortization of intangible assets 
also impacting the increase was the absence in of million of income recorded in associated with our interest rate swaps that expired during and a million increase in insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by the s absence of million of expense recorded during relating to the redemption of our million senior notes 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in  however  selling expenses remained constant at of total revenue 
the dollar increase was due primarily to a million increase in sales commissions paid to outside realtors relating to homes delivered and a million increase in internal sales commissions due to the higher average sales price of homes delivered 
additionally  sales office and model expenses increased million primarily due to the increase in new communities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the homebuilding segment was billion  an increase of and million from this increase was due to a increase in housing revenue million  offset partially by a decrease in land revenue million 
the increase in housing revenue was primarily due to an increase of in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  along with the increase in the number of homes delivered from  in to  in the average sales price of homes delivered increased in all of our markets  with the largest increases occurring in our florida region 
the number of homes delivered increased in all of our markets except indianapolis and tampa 
indianapolis was lower than due to the available communities consisting of some older  less desirable communities that we were closing out  and tampa was lower than due to the impact of delays in land development and opening of new communities and general slowness of the building permit process 
the decrease in land revenue was primarily due to our exit from the phoenix market which had no outside lot sales in compared to million in reductions in land revenue totaling million occurred in our charlotte and raleigh markets due to the sell off of remaining lots in less desirable communities in partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in washington  dc  where lots were sold in compared to lot in land revenue can vary significantly from year to year  given that management opportunistically determines the particular land or lots to be sold directly to third parties 
home sales and backlog 
new contracts in decreased over the prior year  from  to  new contracts decreased in our midwest ohio and indiana region  despite an increase in our cincinnati market  primarily due to higher mortgage rates  nominal job growth and regulatory delays in opening new communities 
we expect the midwest market conditions and the delays in opening new communities to also adversely affect sales in the midwest during the first half of when compared to the same period in new contracts increased in all of our other markets except tampa  with the largest increases occurring in our cincinnati  orlando and charlotte markets due to both the economic conditions in those markets and the availability of new communities in exclusive or high demand locations 
the number of new contracts recorded in future periods will be dependent on numerous factors  including future economic conditions  timing of land acquisitions and development  consumer confidence  number of communities and interest rates available to potential homebuyers 
at december   our backlog consisted of  homes  with an approximate sales value of million 
this represents a increase in units and a increase in sales value from december  the average sales price of homes in backlog increased by  with increases occurring in most of our markets 
this increase in the average sales price of homes in backlog is attributable partially to the overall increase in sales prices of our new contracts due to customers selecting more options  along with the mix of homes in backlog at the end of including more homes than the prior year end within our florida and washington  dc markets  where our homes carry higher sales prices than in our midwest region 
gross margin 
the gross margin for the homebuilding segment was for  compared to for housing gross margin increased from to and land gross margin decreased from to 
the increase in housing s gross margin was mainly due to the increase in sales prices in excess of cost increases within certain markets  due to demand  with the largest impact in the west palm beach  columbus and tampa markets 
several other markets showed smaller increases in gross margin percentage as a result of changes in mix of homes delivered  including the impact of customers selecting more options  which generally have higher margins  along with operating efficiencies 
the increase in land s gross margin was due primarily to lots sold in the washington  dc market 
land gross margins can vary significantly from year to year depending on the sales price  the cost of the community and the stage of development in which the sale takes place 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  but decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
the dollar increase was primarily due to million higher payroll related costs relating to the increases in homes delivered and net income  million expense in for certain costs incurred for the prepayment of our senior subordinated notes and a million increase in audit and professional fees primarily as a result of implementation of programs that are now required of public companies 
offsetting the above increases is a million decrease in management bonuses that is a result of the passing of our former chairman  a million decrease in homeowner s association fees and real estate taxes due to fewer open communities and s absence of a million commission paid on phoenix land sales related to exiting that market 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in  however  selling expenses decreased from of revenue in to in the dollar increase was due primarily to a million increase in sales commissions paid to outside realtors relating to homes delivered and a million increase in internal sales commissions due to both higher average sales price of homes delivered and the increase in the number of homes delivered 
these increases were partially offset by s allocation of million of marketing costs to financial services associated with slowing midwest business 
financial services operations the following table sets forth certain information related to our financial services operations year ended december  dollars in thousands number of loans originated value of loans originated revenue general administrative expenses income before income taxes year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
mortgage and title operations revenue decreased million  from million in to million in the decrease was expected  and was the result of an decline in the number of loans originated combined with the absence in of million of income recorded in resulting from a change in estimate related to marking interest rate lock commitments to market value in accordance with sfas and related derivatives guidance 
at december   m i financial was operating in eight of our nine markets 
in these eight markets  of our homes delivered that were financed were through m i financial 
as a result of lower refinance volume for outside lenders  resulting in increased competition for m i s homebuyer customer  in we expect to experience continued downward pressure on our capture rate and margins 
this could negatively affect earnings in the future due to the lower capture rate and tighter margins 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease over the amount of million 
the decrease was primarily due to the absence in of million marketing costs recorded in associated with the slowing midwest business  offset partially by a million increase in payroll and incentive related costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
mortgage and title operations revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in mortgage operations revenue increased million  due to several factors  including a higher average loan amount  in compared to  in  along with increased gains on mortgages and the sale of servicing rights and higher margins generated by certain mortgage products  such as interest only and low down payment mortgage loans 
the increase also reflects a million change in estimate related to marking interest rate lock commitments to market value in accordance with sfas and related derivatives guidance 
title operations revenue increased million due to the full year impact of the increase in ownership percentage of certain title company operations in the fourth quarter of at december   m i financial was operating in eight of our nine markets 
in these eight markets  of our homes delivered that were financed were through m i financial 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the amount of million 
the increase was primarily due to million increase in marketing costs associated with slowing midwest business and million increase in title company general and administrative costs due to the increase in ownership percentage discussed above

refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this obligation 
d the amount reported herein of million represents principal and interest for a bond obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of lots in a community in florida 
this obligation will be repaid as the company closes on the lot in this community to a third party and the estimated payments by period above have been estimated based on the expected timing of closings 
in addition  in connection with the development of certain of the company s communities  local government entities have been established and bonds have been issued by those entities to finance a portion of the related infrastructure

off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guaranties and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
the entities typically meet the criteria of variable interest entities  although certain of our llcs do not meet the criteria of a variable interest entity because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors and because these entities have outside financing that the company does not guarantee 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities  and our ownership in each of the other llcs is not in excess of  therefore  our homebuilding llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million plus our million share of letters of credit totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress

further details relating to our unconsolidated llcs are included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under option often meet the criteria for variable interest entities  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements to be the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including cash deposits of million  letters of credit of million and corporate promissory notes of million 
further details relating to our land option agreements are included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits

guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guaranty purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
m i financial has also provided indemnifications to certain third party investors and insurers in lieu of repurchasing certain loans 
the risk associated with the guarantees and indemnities above is offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
in recent years  we have generally been able to raise prices by amounts at least equal to our cost increases and  accordingly  have not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation  however  in  we may not be able to raise prices by amounts equal to our cost increases and may experience lower gross margins 
when we develop lots for our own use  inflation may increase our profits because land costs are fixed well in advance of sales efforts 
we are generally able to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date construction is started on a home through the delivery date 
however  in certain situations  unanticipated costs may occur between the time of start and the delivery date  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities that permit borrowings up to million as of december   subject to availability constraints
