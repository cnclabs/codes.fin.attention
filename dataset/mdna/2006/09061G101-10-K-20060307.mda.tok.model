item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the other information in this form k  investors should carefully consider the following discussion and the information under risk factors when evaluating us and our business 
overview we develop and commercialize innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant medical need  have well understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first to market 
our product portfolio is comprised of three approved products and multiple investigational product candidates 
approved products include aldurazyme  naglazyme and orapred 
aldurazyme has been approved for marketing in the us by the fda  in the us by the ec and in other countries for the treatment of mps i 
we have developed aldurazyme through a joint venture with genzyme 
aldurazyme net revenue recorded by our joint venture for totaled million  compared to million for in may  we completed the transaction to acquire the business of ascent pediatrics from medicis 
the ascent pediatrics business includes orapred  a drug primarily used to treat asthma exacerbations in children and other inflammatory conditions and two additional proprietary formulations of orapred in development 
orapred net product sales for totaled million  compared to million in in october  we announced that the fda had accepted for filing the new drug application for orapred odt for the treatment of inflammatory conditions 
we expect to receive a response from the fda by june  in may  the fda granted marketing approval for naglazyme for the treatment of mps vi  a debilitating life threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists 
naglazyme net product sales for totaled million 
in january  we announced that we received marketing approval from the ec for naglazyme for mps vi in the eu we are in the process of launching the product in the eu on a country by country basis 
we are developing several product candidates for the treatment of genetic diseases including phenoptin  a proprietary oral form of tetrahydrobiopterin r bh or r bh  for the treatment of moderate to mild forms of pku  and phenylase  a preclinical enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of the more severe form of pku 
we are developing phenoptin for the treatment of r bh responsive phenylketonurics and phenylase for phenylketonurics who are not r bh responsive 
our research and development expense during  primarily related to the development of naglazyme and phenoptin  totaled million compared to million in our net loss totaled million for compared to million in our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
unless otherwise noted below  there have not been any recent changes to our assumptions  judgments or estimates included in our critical accounting policies 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition and related reserves  income taxes  inventory  research and development  and stock option plans have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to our financial statements included with this report 
investment in biomarin genzyme llc  advances to biomarin genzyme llc and equity in the loss income of biomarin genzyme llc we account for our joint venture investment using the equity method 
accordingly  we record an increase in our investment for contributions to the joint venture and a reduction or increase in our investment for our share of the loss or income of the joint venture  respectively 
equity in the loss income of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss income for the period 
advances to biomarin genzyme llc include the current receivable from the joint venture for the reimbursement related to our services provided to the joint venture and the investment in biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s net equity 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include our investment in biomarin genzyme llc  property  plant and equipment  and the acquired orapred intangible assets and goodwill 
we regularly review long lived assets for impairment 
the recoverability of long lived assets  other than goodwill  is measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no significant impairments were recognized for the year ended december  in december  we recognized an impairment loss related to the acquired orapred intangible assets  totaling approximately million  which was recorded as an impairment of acquired intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we currently operate in one business segment  the biopharmaceutical development and commercialization segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our single operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
these lower levels are referred to as reporting units 
currently  we have identified the orapred business as a separate reporting unit  which includes all of our intangible assets and goodwill and is a component of our single operating segment 
we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by assessing the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value as determined by a discounted cash flow model  unless facts and circumstances warrant a review of goodwill for impairment before that time 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
we believe that our investment in the joint venture will be recovered because we project that the joint venture will maintain sustained positive earnings and cash flows in the future 
the joint venture recorded net income of million during we and our joint venture partner maintain the ability and intent to fund the joint venture s operations  as necessary 
the recoverability of the carrying value of leasehold improvements for our administrative facilities will depend on the successful execution of our business initiatives and our ability to earn sufficient returns on our approved products and product candidates 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues consist of naglazyme and orapred product sales and revenues from our collaborative agreements with serono and genzyme 
naglazyme product sales we recognize revenue from naglazyme product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered to the customer  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
naglazyme product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
naglazyme is generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end users  such as hospitals  which act as retailers 
because of the pricing of naglazyme  the limited number of patients and the customers limited return rights  the specialty pharmacies generally carry a very limited inventory 
we also sell naglazyme to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers  which  with respect to naglazyme  act as intermediaries between us and end users and generally do not stock quantities of naglazyme 
accordingly  we expect that sales related to naglazyme in the us will be closely tied to end user demand 
we record reserves for rebates payable under medicaid and other government programs as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our reserve calculations require estimates  including estimates of sales mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period  and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
to the extent actual rebates differ from our estimates  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed 
we record allowances for product returns  if appropriate  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product returns is required  including market exclusivity of the product based on its orphan drug status  the patient population  the customers limited return rights and our joint venture s experience of returns for aldurazyme  which is a similar product 
based on these factors  management has concluded that naglazyme product returns will be minimal 
in the future  if any of these factors and or the history of product returns changes  an allowance for product returns may be required 
as naglazyme was approved for commercial sale in the us during the second quarter of  we have limited historical experience with rebates and returns specific to naglazyme 
until adequate historical experience is obtained to serve as a reasonable basis for our estimates of rebates and returns  management will use  to the extent available  current estimated sales mix of which sales will be eligible for rebates  estimated rebate rates for state medicaid programs and other government programs  as well as experience obtained through the commercialization of aldurazyme by our joint venture with genzyme  which is a similar product 
the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable revenue dilution item that are applied to gross sales of naglazyme to derive net sales are described in the table below 
revenue dilution item percentage of gross sales description rebates rebates offered to state medicaid and other government programs cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total orapred product sales we recognize revenue from orapred product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
orapred product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
the timing of customer purchases and the resulting product shipments have a significant impact on the amount of revenue from orapred product sales that we recognize in a particular period 
also  the majority of orapred sales are made to wholesalers  which  in turn  resell the product to retail outlets 
orapred inventory in the distribution channel consists of inventory held by wholesalers  which are our principal customers  and inventory held by retailers 
our revenue from orapred sales in a particular period is impacted by increases or decreases in wholesalers inventory levels 
the buying practices of the wholesalers include occasional speculative purchases of orapred in excess of the current market demand  at their discretion  in anticipation of future price increases 
during  continued decreases in orapred retail demand due to increased generic competition has contributed to high levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
if wholesaler inventories of orapred continue to substantially exceed retail demand  we could experience further reduced revenue from sales in subsequent periods  or additional product returns from the distribution channel due to overstocking  low end user demand or product expiration 
we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of a portion of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective plans 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of the original sale 
the rebate reserves are based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care organizations and state medicaid patients  as well as the rebate rates associated with eligible prescriptions 
the estimates are developed using the product s rebate history adjusted to reflect known and forecasted changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these factors include changes in the mix of prescriptions that are eligible for rebates  changes in the contract rebate rates and the lag time related to the processing of rebate claims by our customers and managed care organizations 
the length of time between the period of prescriptions and the processing of the related rebates has been consistent historically at between three and six months  depending on the nature of the rebate 
the length of time between the period of original sale by us and the processing of the related rebate is dependent upon both the length of time that the product is in the distribution channel and the lag time related to rebate processing by third parties 
additionally  we have experienced longer than usual rebate processing lag times as a result of the transition of the product from medicis after the acquisition and high levels of orapred inventory held by wholesalers 
rebate rates are sensitive to changes resulting from new medicaid and managed care contracts entered into by us  and rebate rates may increase in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our estimates of future rebates payable to medicaid programs and managed care organizations  which have decreased significantly due to a lower than anticipated number of rebate contracts executed by us 
the decrease in estimated future rebates resulted in reserve reversals and an increase in net revenue of approximately million  which was recorded during the fourth quarter of to the extent actual rebates differ from our estimates  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed 
provisions for sales discounts and estimates for chargebacks and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by our management as its best estimate at the time of the original sale based on the product s historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to gross sales and accounts receivable through an allowance or as an addition to accrued expenses 
we generally permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned near or after expiration 
our estimates for future product returns are primarily based on the actual return history for the product and estimates of future demand related to estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
although we are unable to quantify wholesaler inventory levels of orapred with any certainty  to the extent necessary based on the expiration date and our estimates of quantity of product in the distribution channel  we adjust our estimate for future returns as appropriate 
we estimate wholesaler inventory levels  to the extent possible  based on limited information obtained from certain of our wholesale customers and through other internal analyses 
our internal analyses utilize information such as historical sales to wholesalers  product shelf life based on expiration dating  estimates of the length of time product is in the distribution channel and historical prescription data  which are provided by a third party vendor 
we also evaluate the current and future commercial market for orapred and consider factors such as orapred s performance compared to its existing competitors 
the amount of orapred returns in the normal course of business compared to sales has been reasonably consistent historically 
our experience is that the length of time between the period of original sale and the product return is between one and two years 
because the product has been on the market for approximately four years and the product expiration dating is two to three years  we are continuing to obtain and analyze the returns history 
during  continued decreases in orapred retail demand resulting from increased generic competition have contributed to excess wholesaler orapred inventories 
as a result  we estimate that orapred returns upon product expiration will significantly increase from our previous estimates  and we have increased the related reserves and reduced net revenue by approximately million  which was recorded during the fourth quarter of if there are additional changes in orapred retail demand that impact the wholesaler inventory levels  additional reserves or reserve reversals may be required 
additionally  in the ascent pediatrics transaction we acquired liabilities for certain orapred product returns and unclaimed rebates for the period prior to our acquisition of the product 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our estimates of these liabilities  which are recorded as operating expenses because they relate to sales made by the previous owner  based on the circumstances described above  resulting in an increase to the returns reserve of million and an decrease in the rebates reserve of million  for a net impact of million 
we may need to further adjust our estimates of these liabilities in the future based on further changes in the market demand for orapred and changes to our rebate contracts 
as discussed above  our estimates of revenue dilution items are based primarily on the historical experience for the product  as adjusted to reflect known and forecasted changes in the factors that impact the revenue dilutions 
the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable effective rates for revenue dilution items that are applied to gross sales of orapred to derive net sales are described in the table below 
as discussed above  the estimated rebate allowance rates disclosed below have decreased in and the estimated rates for product returns have increased 
during  the effective rate of the returns provision was approximately  after adjusting our returns reserves for the significant amount of inventory that we expect will be returned due to decreased retail demand resulting from increased generic competition 
however  our product returns rate in the normal course of business absent excess levels of inventory at specific wholesalers remains consistent with previous periods  at approximately 
there are no additional material revenue dilution items other than those disclosed below and there have been no material revisions to our estimates of our revenue dilution items to date  except as discussed above 
revenue dilution item percentage of gross sales description sales returns provision for returns of product sales rebates rebates offered to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total we periodically evaluate the need to maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when making this evaluation  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and the aging profile of customer accounts receivable and assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  the orapred product has not experienced significant credit losses and our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is insignificant 
this is due to a significant portion of orapred sales that are made to a limited number of financially viable distributors  because we offer discounts that encourage the prompt payment of outstanding receivables and because we require immediate payment in certain circumstances 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that allowances will not be required in the future 
if we begin to experience credit losses  our operating expenses would increase 
collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues from serono include both license revenue and contract research revenue 
nonrefundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement through research and development collaboration are initially deferred and recognized as license revenue over the estimated period for which we continue to have a performance obligation 
license revenue includes the portion of the million up front license fee received from serono recognized as revenue during the development period 
our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation are based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangement  the level of effort required for us to fulfill our obligation and the anticipated timing of the fulfillment of our obligation 
accordingly  we have deferred the up front license fee received from serono and will recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over approximately years  which represents an assumption of the time from inception of the agreement until european regulatory approval of phenoptin for the treatment of pku  at which point the company s performance obligations for developing phenoptin for the treatment of pku will end 
our assumption of the phenoptin commercialization period is based on several underlying assumptions about uncertain events  including actions by european regulatory authorities  results of our ongoing clinical trials and successful commercial scale manufacturing of phenoptin 
as phenoptin advances through the clinical development and regulatory process  our estimates of our performance obligation period may change 
the estimate was revised during the fourth quarter of  from years to years  based on updated information regarding the estimated timing of european regulatory approval 
the change in estimate did not have a significant impact on revenues during  but is expected to have a material impact in future periods 
changes in our estimates of our performance obligation period will be recognized prospectively over the remaining estimated performance obligation period 
we regularly review our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation 
nonrefundable reimbursements received for shared development costs are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
contract research revenue included in collaborative agreement revenues represented serono s share of phenoptin development costs under the agreement 
collaborative agreement revenue from genzyme included million received in  related to the fda marketing approval for aldurazyme 
milestone payments are recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved and the company has no future performance obligations related to that payment 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards  of approximately million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
this critical accounting assumption has been historically accurate  as we have not been able to utilize our net deferred tax assets  and we do not expect changes to this assumption as we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or fair value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical estimate in this determination is the estimate of the future expected inventory requirements  whereby we compare our internal sales forecasts to inventory on hand 
during  increased generic competition to orapred has resulted in continued decreases in end user demand 
as a result  we revised our estimates of expected inventory requirements and recognized additional orapred inventory write offs of approximately million  of which million was recorded during the fourth quarter of actual results may differ from those estimates and additional inventory write offs may be required 
regulatory approval for naglazyme was not received until may  and costs related to the manufacturing of naglazyme prior to this date were expensed as research and development expenses 
we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain  and product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained  as such  the related manufacturing costs for naglazyme were not capitalized as inventory 
when regulatory approval was obtained in may  we began capitalizing inventory at the lower of cost or fair value 
naglazyme inventory as of december  includes a portion of the zero cost basis quantities 
until we begin to sell the inventory produced after regulatory approval was obtained  the cost of goods sold or used in clinical trials for the previously expensed inventory will be insignificant or zero 
we expect that the majority of the previously expensed inventory will be sold or used in clinical trials by the first quarter of research and development research and development expenses include expenses associated with contract research and development provided by third parties  product manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  clinical and regulatory costs  and internal research and development costs 
a critical accounting assumption by our management is that we believe that regulatory approval of our product candidates is uncertain  and do not assume that product manufactured prior to regulatory approval will be sold commercially 
as a result  inventory costs for product candidates are expensed as research and development expenses until regulatory approval is obtained  at which time inventory is capitalized at the lower of cost or fair value 
historically  there have been no changes to this assumption 
stock option plans we have three stock based compensation plans 
we account for those plans under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  whereby generally no stock based compensation cost is reflected in our net loss for options issued to employees and directors with exercise prices at or above the market price on the date of issuance 
we recognize as an expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
the fair value of options granted is determined using the black scholes model  which requires various estimates and assumptions by management  including the expected term of the options and the expected future volatility of the value of our stock 
the expected term of stock options is determined primarily based on the historical patterns for stock option exercises and cancellations 
the expected future volatility is determined based on both the historical volatility as well as current and future circumstances that will affect future volatility 
these estimates are sensitive to change based on external factors such as the equity markets in general and the individual circumstances of our employees  which are considered in the determination of our estimates 
the adoption of fas r in the first quarter of may result in additional changes to our estimates and assumptions because of differences between the old and new accounting pronouncements with respect to the development of certain valuation assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements see note q of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations all of the activities related to the manufacture  distribution and sale of aldurazyme are reported in the results of the joint venture 
because of this presentation and the significance of the joint venture s operations compared to our total operations  we have divided our discussion of the results of operations into two sections  biomarin in total and biomarin genzyme llc 
the discussion of the joint venture s operations includes the total amounts for the joint venture  not just our interest in the operations 
biomarin results of operations net loss our net loss in as compared to decreased to million from million 
net loss for decreased as a result of the following in millions reduction of expenses associated with ascent pediatrics acquisition includes million of non recurring in process research and development expense in absence of impairment of acquired intangible assets increased profits from biomarin genzyme llc phenoptin collaborative agreement revenues increase in orapred operating loss decrease in naglazyme operating loss increased phenoptin research and development expenses increased facility expenses  including depreciation absence of separation costs associated with former ceo increased interest expense and decrease in interest income  excluding imputed interest net decrease in other operating expenses total decrease in net loss the expenses associated with the ascent pediatrics acquisition decreased in due to the absence of a non recurring acquired in process research and development expense of million incurred in  million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and a decrease of million related to a fair value inventory adjustment  offset by an increase of million related to imputed interest expense 
the increase in profits from biomarin genzyme llc during as compared to is primarily the result of increased aldurazyme sales  which are recorded through the joint venture with genzyme 
the increase in orapred operating net loss is attributable to decrease in gross profit of million  which includes a charge for inventory write offs of million  increased spending on research and development for orapred odt of million  offset by other net operating expenditure decreases of million 
the decrease in naglazyme net loss is attributable to increased gross profit of million  decreased research and development expenses of million  partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses for commercialization of million and other net operating expenditure increases of million 
our net loss in as compared to increased to million from million 
net loss for increased as a result of the following in millions expenses associated with ascent pediatrics acquisition includes million of in process research and development expense impairment of acquired intangible assets decrease in equity in loss of joint venture due to increased aldurazyme sales lack of non recurring milestone revenue orapred operating profit separation costs associated with former ceo absence of reversal of lease liability net decrease in other operating expenses increased interest expense due to convertible debt issued in june other total increase in net loss expenses associated with the ascent pediatrics acquisition include acquired in process research and development of million  amortization of acquired intangible assets of million  imputed interest expense of million and a fair value inventory adjustment of million 
the net decrease in other operating expenses is the result of decreased research and development expense  primarily attributable to the lack of neutralase development costs  offset by increased naglazyme and phenoptin research and development expenses and corporate overhead 
revenue and gross profit net product sales decreased million  to million in from million in net product sales in of million included million of net product sales of naglazyme and million of net product sales of orapred 
net product sales in were exclusively related to net product sales of orapred 
in may  we received marketing approval for naglazyme in the us  and began shipping product in late june net product sales for naglazyme for were million 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  we began capitalizing naglazyme inventory production costs after us regulatory approval was obtained in may as a result  all of the product sold in had a zero cost basis 
we expect to report lower cost of goods sold for naglazyme until all of the inventory manufactured prior to marketing approval is sold or used in clinical trials 
we estimate that the majority of the zero balance inventory will be sold by the first quarter of commencing with our acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business on may   our revenues include sales of orapred 
during  we recognized million of net product sales of orapred and approximately million of gross profit  representing a gross margin of approximately 
net sales in include a million charge related to increases in orapred product returns reserves  and a million benefit related to the reversal of medicaid and managed care rebate reserves 
cost of sales of million includes a million charge related to increases in inventory write offs 
gross margin for excluding the inventory write off was 
cost of sales excludes the amortization of the developed product technology resulting from the acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business 
retail demand for orapred continued to decrease throughout due to increased generic competition 
the decreased demand in conjunction with significant levels of orapred inventory held by wholesalers has resulted in decreased orapred net product sales 
we expect the adverse impact on net product sales to continue in the future 
in march  we launched an authorized orapred generic product and recognized million of related net revenue during  which is included in the million of total orapred net product sales during the year 
during  we recognized million of net product sales of orapred and approximately million of gross profit  representing a gross margin of approximately 
cost of sales of million includes a million charge related to an inventory fair market value adjustment associated with the acquisition and a million charge for excess orapred raw materials 
gross margin for excluding these items was 
cost of sales excludes the amortization of the developed product technology resulting from the acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business 
net sales of orapred during were lower than expected as a result of larger than anticipated levels of orapred inventory held by distributors prior to our acquisition of the product and a new generic competitor to orapred introduced in the fourth quarter of collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues include milestone revenue under our development and commercialization agreement with genzyme  as well as both license revenue and contract research revenue under our agreement with serono 
collaborative agreement revenues of million for includes the amortization of million of the up front license fee received from serono recognized as revenue during the period and million of reimbursable phenoptin development costs incurred during the period 
the related costs are included in research and development expenses 
collaborative agreement revenue in represents the million milestone payment received from genzyme related to the fda marketing approval of aldurazyme 
we do not expect to earn additional revenue related to aldurazyme milestones in the future 
research and development expense our research and development expenses include personnel  facility and external costs associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and products 
these development costs primarily include preclinical and clinical studies  manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  quality control and assurance and other product development expenses such as regulatory costs 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased phenoptin costs of million  increased phenylase costs of million and research and development costs of million associated with the new orapred odt formulation 
the increase was offset by decreased naglazyme costs of million and decreased costs related to other programs of million 
the increased phenoptin costs primarily include manufacturing costs of million and clinical development costs of million for pku  as well as million in additional spending for the development of r bh to treat endothelial dysfunction  which includes million for license fees paid to daiichi suntory pharma co  ltd 
related to obtaining the exclusive worldwide rights  excluding japan  for the use of r bh the increase in phenoptin development costs is primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses due to the continuation of the phase clinical trial and pre approval manufacturing expenses 
the decrease in naglazyme development costs is primarily due to decreased clinical trial and manufacturing expenses  after marketing approval was received in may however  we expect to incur significant naglazyme research and development costs in the foreseeable future due to long term clinical activities related to post approval regulatory commitments 
research and development expenses decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to million of neutralase development costs incurred during that were not incurred during  because the program was discontinued  and decreased research and decreased development on other programs totaling million 
the decrease was offset by increased naglazyme costs of million  increased phenoptin costs of million and research and development costs associated with the new orapred formulations of million 
the increased naglazyme costs include million of increased manufacturing and quality costs  million of increased clinical costs primarily related to the phase clinical trial and million of regulatory costs associated with the filings of the marketing authorization applications 
the increased phenoptin costs primarily include million of manufacturing costs and million of clinical development costs 
selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and administrative personnel  facility and external costs required to support our commercialized products and product development programs 
these selling  general and administrative costs include facility operating expenses and depreciation  sales operations in support of naglazyme and orapred and our product candidates  human resources  finance and support personnel expenses  and other corporate costs such as insurance  audit and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in the components of the increase between and are as follows in millions increased sales and marketing for naglazyme commercialization decreased orapred sales and marketing expenses expenses directly related to reduction of the ascent pediatrics sales force absence of former ceo separation costs increased orapred return expense  related to product sold by the previous seller of orapred decreased orapred rebate expense  related to product sold by the previous seller of orapred increase in facility expenses  including depreciation increased recruiting and relocation expenses net increase in corporate overhead and other administrative costs total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in orapred sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales and marketing efforts during following the reduction in the orapred sales force  reducing overall expenses for the period by million 
the increased orapred return expense includes million related to an increase in estimated product returns for sales made by medicis prior to the acquisition 
the net increase in corporate overhead and other administrative costs includes increased legal fees of million  primarily associated with the proxy contest  and fixed asset write offs of million  offset by million in other corporate decreases  related to changes in certain activities and administrative support costs 
in july  we announced that we were reducing the orapred sales force through the elimination of positions 
severance and related costs and payments of approximately million  associated with eliminating the sales force positions plus six non sales force positions  were recognized in the third quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the components of the increase between and are as follows in millions orapred sales and marketing separation costs associated with former ceo absence of reversal of lease liability in preparation for commercial launch of naglazyme net increase in corporate overhead and other total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses the net increase in corporate overhead and other costs includes increased rent expense  audit fees and administrative personnel

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets includes the current amortization expense of the intangible assets acquired in the ascent pediatrics transaction in may  including the orapred developed and core technology 
the acquired intangible assets are being amortized over years and the amortization expense for was million  as compared to million during the decrease in amortization expense for is primarily attributable to the lower asset value resulting from the impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of we expect that the recurring annual amortization expense associated with the transaction will be approximately million 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development includes the nonrecurring charge for the portion of acquisition consideration attributable to development stage products 
acquired in process research and development of million during includes the fair value of the two additional development stage formulations of orapred that we acquired in the ascent pediatrics transaction 
equity in the loss income of biomarin genzyme llc equity in the loss income of biomarin genzyme llc includes our share of the joint venture s loss or income for the period 
equity in the income of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to a loss of million in the income is principally due to the profits derived from million of aldurazyme sales in compared to million of sales during equity in the loss of biomarin genzyme llc was million in compared to million in the decrease was principally due to increased aldurazyme sales of million  to million in from million in see the biomarin genzyme llc section below for further discussion of the joint venture s results of operations 
impairment of acquired intangible assets no impairment of the orapred acquired intangible assets was recorded for the year ended december  impairment of acquired intangible assets during the year ended december  includes the impairment loss recorded on the orapred product technology during the fourth quarter of in december  the company recognized an impairment loss totaling million 
the primary circumstance leading to the impairment was the introduction of a new generic competitor to orapred during the fourth quarter of that resulted in a significant decrease in the orapred market share 
the impairment charge represents the amount by which the carrying value of the orapred technology exceeded its fair value on december  interest income we invest our cash  short term investments and restricted cash in government and other high credit quality securities in order to limit default and market risk

biomarin genzyme llc results of operations the discussion below gives effect to the inventory capitalization policy that we use for inventory held by the joint venture  which is different from the joint venture s inventory capitalization policy 
we began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in may  after us regulatory approval was obtained 
the joint venture began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in january  when inventory production for commercial sale began 
the difference in inventory capitalization policies results in a greater operating expense realized by us prior to regulatory approval  and lower cost of goods sold with higher gross profit realized by us as the previously expensed product is sold by the joint venture  as well as lower research and development expense when aldurazyme is used in on going clinical trials 
these differences will be eliminated when all of the product manufactured prior to regulatory approval has been sold or has been used in clinical trials 
the majority of the differences have been eliminated as of december  see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the difference in inventory cost basis between the joint venture and us 
revenue and gross profit the joint venture received marketing approval for aldurazyme in the us in april and in the eu in june we have subsequently received marketing approval in other countries 
aldurazyme was launched commercially in may in the us and in june in the us the joint venture recognized million and million of net revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue from to of million is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of patients receiving therapy 
there were approximately and approximately commercial patients on therapy at the end of and  respectively 
gross profit was million and million for and  respectively  representing gross margins of approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin during compared to is attributable to the recognition of higher cost of sales in as the joint venture sells more of the inventory that was produced after obtaining regulatory approval  which has a higher cost basis 
excluding the effect of the difference in inventory cost basis between us and the joint venture  gross profit was million and million  representing gross margins of and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses operating expenses of the joint venture include the costs associated with the development and commercial support of aldurazyme and totaled million for as compared to million for operating expenses in included million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the commercial support of aldurazyme and million of research and development costs  primarily long term clinical trial costs 
operating expenses in included million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the commercial launch of aldurazyme and million of research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in due to normalization of sales and marketing efforts for the product following post launch commercialization 
operating expenses in totaled million and included million of selling  general and administrative expenses related to the commercial launch of aldurazyme and million of research and development expenses 
research and development decreased in compared to due to capitalization of a full year of production costs into inventory in as compared to  as well as decreased clinical trial and research and development costs during selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to increased post launch commercialization activities 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow we have financed our operations by the issuance of common stock  convertible debt  equipment and other commercial financing  collaborative agreements and the related interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during  we received million of net proceeds from a public offering of common stock and million from serono as consideration for execution of our development  license and commercialization agreement 
during  we received million of proceeds from our equipment and facility loan 
as of december   our combined cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt totaled million  a decrease of million from million at december  cash balances related to long term debt represent an amount totaling million that is a portion of the million that we are required to keep on deposit with comerica bank pursuant to the terms of the equipment and facility loan that we entered into in may this amount is equal to the long term portion of the outstanding balance under this facility 
the maintenance of a deposit equal to the outstanding amount under the facility  or million  whichever is greater  is a covenant of the facility and the failure to satisfy this covenant would constitute a breach under the facility 
however  we have the ability to access this amount at our discretion and therefore it is not restricted cash 
the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt during includes net proceeds from the public offering of common stock of million 
excluding the offering proceeds  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt was million  which was million less than the net decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash during of million 
the primary items contributing to the decrease in net cash outflow in were as follows in millions receipt of the up front collaboration payment from serono decreased capital expenditures increased net paydowns and decreases in accruals of accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased investments in the joint venture decrease in net proceeds from equipment and facility loans decreased cash payment for the acquisition of the ascent pediatrics business increased program development  commercialization and support activities receipt of cash proceeds from the espp and exercise of stock options reimbursement from medicis for orapred returns increased investment in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets total decrease in net cash outflow the increased program development  commercialization and support activities relate to cash payments made for operating activities  such as research and development and sales and marketing efforts  as discussed in the results of operations section above 
increases in net payments for working capital primarily include items such as naglazyme and orapred inventory and accounts receivable 
the primary uses of cash during were to finance operations  which primarily included the manufacturing and clinical trials of naglazyme and the related supporting functions  the ascent pediatrics transaction and the manufacturing and clinical development of phenoptin 
uses of cash during include payments related to the ascent pediatrics transaction totaling million  an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the development of our facilities of million  and the lack of the million milestone revenue received in these uses of cash were partially offset by equipment and facility loan proceeds of million  net orapred operating cash inflow  a decrease in the cash investment in the joint venture and other working capital changes 
pursuant to our settlement of a dispute with medicis in january  medicis made available to us a convertible note of up to million beginning july   based on certain terms and conditions and provided that the company does not experience a change of control 
advances under the convertible note are convertible into our common stock  at medicis option  according to the terms of the convertible note 
medicis may only exercise the conversion right at the maturity or earlier repayment of the loan 
as of december   we have not made any draws on the note 
we anticipate that we will only draw funds from this note to the extent necessary to fund operations or to maintain financial covenants 
medicis also agreed to pay us million for orapred returns  all of which was received by july we do not expect to generate net positive cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future because we expect to continue to incur operational expenses and continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  process development  including quality systems for product manufacture  regulatory processes in the us and international jurisdictions  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and contract manufacturing  and expansion of sales and marketing activities  including commercial launch activities for naglazyme and the support of the ascent pediatrics business 
as a result of the ascent pediatrics transaction and the january amendments to the transaction agreements  we expect to pay medicis million in specified cash payments through  of which million is payable in funding commitments we expect to fund our operations with our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and currently restricted cash  supplemented by proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
we expect our current cash  short term investments  currently restricted cash and cash balances related to long term debt and funds contractually committed to us will meet our operating and capital requirements into the first quarter of our investment in our product development programs has a major impact on our operating performance 
our research and development expenses for the years  and  and for the period since inception march represent the following in millions since program inception naglazyme phenoptin orapred vibrilase not allocated to specific major projects we cannot estimate the cost to complete any of our product development programs 
additionally  except as disclosed under overview above  we cannot estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs 
please see risk factors for a discussion of the reasons that we are unable to estimate such information  and in particular if we fail to maintain regulatory approval to commercially market or sell our drugs  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased  to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain  if we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program  if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected  and if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we expect that the proceeds from equity or debt financing  loans or collaborative agreements will be used to fund future operating costs  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which may include costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials and the manufacturing of aldurazyme  naglazyme  orapred and phenoptin  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  general corporate purposes  payment of the amounts due with respect to the ascent pediatrics transaction  and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully market and sell naglazyme in the us and eu  our joint venture partner s ability to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  our ability to successfully regain market share of orapred  the progress  timing  scope and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments  any changes made to or new developments in our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future 
borrowings and contractual obligations our million of convertible notes will impact our liquidity due to the semi annual cash interest payments and the scheduled repayment of the notes in should we redeem the notes after june  at our option according to the terms of the notes  we will be subject to premiums upon redemption ranging from to  depending on the time the notes are redeemed 
we also must repay the debt if there is a qualifying change in control or termination of trading of our common stock

our unrestricted cash  as defined in the loan agreement  totaled million as of december  as a result of the ascent pediatrics transaction  we expect to pay medicis million in specified payments through  of which million is payable in at our option  we may elect to pay medicis million of the amounts due in through the issuance of our common stock 
we will need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our drug product candidates currently under development 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be obtained or  if obtained  will be available on reasonable terms or in a timely manner 
we have contractual and commercial obligations under our debt  operating leases and other obligations related to research and development activities  licenses and sales royalties with annual minimums

we are also subject to contingent payments totaling approximately million upon achievement of certain regulatory and licensing milestones if they occur before certain dates in the future 
included in the total amount is million of contingent payments related to neutralase  for which we terminated development during and  accordingly  we do not expect they will ever be payable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and  therefore  our investment portfolio is not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations unless the investments are sold 
the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments total of cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds and of uninvested cash 
of short term investments invested in us agency securities 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt and our equipment and facility loans 
our convertible debt carries a fixed interest rate and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our convertible debt 
the interest rates for certain of our equipment and facility loans are based on the london inter bank offer rate libor and we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the libor market 
the outstanding principal balance on our equipment and facility loans that carry libor based rates was million as of december  the carrying value of our convertible debt and equipment loans approximates their fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate market risk a significant portion of aldurazyme sales by biomarin genzyme llc are earned outside of the us and  therefore  our equity in the loss income of biomarin genzyme llc is subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the policies and procedures related to the management of foreign currency risk of aldurazyme sales are maintained and performed by our joint venture partner  genzyme  which may include foreign currency forward contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   we do not expect that a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
a significant portion of naglazyme sales are earned outside of the us and our related revenues and account receivables are subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
these risks may be managed with selective use of derivatives 
we may use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which have a maturity of less than one year 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are reported in current earnings 
the notional settlement value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  is million 
at december   these contracts had a fair value of  representing an unrealized loss 
the amount has been recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet as of december
