item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of devry s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview devry ended fiscal year with a continuation of the improving trends seen throughout the past year 
revenues increased by and operating profits more than doubled in fiscal with all three of devry s business segments contributing to these gains 
revenue growth combined with cost control produced net income for fiscal of million 
earnings per share of was a significant increase compared to per share in fiscal both financially and operationally  devry made progress in executing its strategic growth plan 
such accomplishments include in july  devry acquired gearty cpe  a provider of continuing professional education programs and seminars in accounting and finance  enabling becker professional review to efficiently enter the continuing professional education marketplace 
through improved execution in marketing and recruiting  devry continued to build momentum in new student growth 
summer enrollment at devry university was the fifth consecutive class that experienced positive undergraduate new student growth 
during fiscal  devry university expanded the number of programs offered online  including bachelor s degree programs in game and simulation programming  network and communications management and a new finance concentration within the bachelor of business administration degree 
in addition  associate degrees in accounting technology and health information management were also offered online 
in  devry increased its admission and progression requirements at ross university to ensure quality outcomes for its students 
ross university also enhanced its marketing activities and customer service efforts 
as a result  growth accelerated and ross university achieved three terms of solid new student enrollment growth in fiscal becker professional review posted solid financial results in fiscal  with a record million in revenue  largely attributable to continued strong demand for accounting professionals 
free cash flow generation increased from and was used to invest in operations and reduce debt 
devry paid down million in debt during fiscal  and an additional million in july devry undertook careful succession planning  making significant investments to enhance its human capital and position it for future growth 
devry announced the planned transition of ronald l 
taylor from chief executive officer to senior advisor  effective at its annual meeting on november  daniel hamburger  devry s current president and chief operating officer will assume the responsibility of chief executive officer 
during the last eighteen months  devry also appointed a new chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer  president of devry university and several other senior manager positions

fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  revenues total consolidated revenue for fiscal of million increased million  or  as compared to last year 
revenues are reported net of tuition refunds applicable to students who withdraw from the academic term for which they are enrolled during the period specified by the refund policy 
revenue increased at all three of devry s business segments primarily due to new student enrollment growth and tuition and price increases as compared to the year ago period 
in addition  revenue increased due in part to higher sales of becker cpa review materials  the expanding sale of ebooks and higher interest revenue on investments and on undergraduate accounts receivable under devry s student financing program 
devry university in the devry university segment  revenues of million increased by million  or  as compared to fiscal tuition revenues are the largest component of total revenues in the devry university segment 
the two principal factors that influence revenues are enrollment and tuition rates 
key trends in these two components are set forth below 
total undergraduate enrollment by term declined by from summer to summer  declined by from fall to fall  and increased by from spring to spring new undergraduate enrollment by term increased by from summer to summer  increased by from fall to fall  
table of contents increased by from spring to spring  and the summer term marked the fifth consecutive term in which new undergraduate student enrollments increased from the year ago level 
graduate coursetaker enrollment increased by during the six sessions of fiscal  and increased by from the july session to the july session 
tuition rates undergraduate program tuition increased by approximately in july  and graduate school program tuition increased by approximately for the september session following a similar increase in january devry believes that the increasing undergraduate new student enrollments in fiscal were the result of better integration of marketing and recruiting functions  an improved overall marketing communication plan and better management of lead flow 
also  management believes that demand for technology graduates continues to improve  positively influencing career decisions of new students towards this field of study 
further diversification of programs has offered another avenue for enrollment growth 
devry university announced a new online specialty within its bachelor of science in technical management degree program  called health information management hit 
this new specialty provides an opportunity for those who hold an associate degree in health information  such as graduates of devry s hit program  to move seamlessly to a bachelor s degree and advance within this field 
devry believes that efforts at keller to create new brand awareness through improved messaging have produced positive results and will continue to focus on further improvements in the future 
also contributing to higher total revenues in the devry university segment was an increase in other education revenue partly from sales of electronic textbook materials ebooks 
in the first quarter of fiscal  devry completed an agreement with follett higher education group follett to manage the nine remaining us devry university campus bookstores not already managed by follett 
as a result  reported bookstore sales revenue was lower than it had been in previous periods 
however  devry university sales of ebooks in selected graduate and undergraduate online and on site courses beginning in the latter part of fiscal has more than offset the reduction in revenues from the bookstores previously managed by devry university 
devry reports the sale of ebooks at their full selling price which is a higher unit price sale than the commission income it reports on book and supply sales by follett 
further contributing to the increase in other educational revenue were higher interest charges on undergraduate student accounts receivable which were generally higher in fiscal than they were in the prior year 
these receivables are generally subject to a monthly interest charge of one percent under devry university s educard revolving charge plan for financing students education 
these charges generated approximately million more in student financing charges in fiscal than in the prior year 
partly offsetting the increases in revenue from improved enrollments and higher tuition rates is a growing proportion of working adult undergraduate students who typically enroll for less than a full time academic load 
these students are primarily enrolled in online programs and at programs offered at devry university centers 
these part time students pay a lesser total average tuition amount each term than do full time students at the undergraduate campus locations 
therefore  the higher revenue per student resulting from tuition increases has been partially offset by a greater proportion of part time students 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  revenues reached a record high of million  increasing by million  or from fiscal the primary reason for the increase was increased enrollment in the becker professional review s cpa review courses and from increased sales of cpa review courses on cd rom 
management believes that these increases are being driven by the continued demand for cpas by accounting 
table of contents and consulting firms 
further contributing to growth in this segment was increased enrollment in the stalla cfa review course in preparation to the administration of the level exam which was administered in december and june 
this is only the second year in which level of the exam has been offered in december 
to further strengthen becker professional review results in future periods  becker hired a new director of international operations and two directors of business operations responsible for sales and marketing of all becker products in canada and in the heavily populated east coast market 
in july  devry completed the acquisition of gearty cpe 
gearty cpe is a provider of continuing professional education programs and seminars in accounting and finance  predominantly serving customers in the new york new jersey metro area 
the acquisition complements the becker professional review cpa exam review business 
the acquisition is being integrated into the becker operations in other appropriate markets across the country but has not yet contributed significantly to the revenues or operating income of the professional and training segment 
medical and healthcare in the medical and healthcare segment  revenues of million increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to last year 
included in this segment are million in revenues for fiscal at chamberlain as compared to million for fiscal devry acquired chamberlain in march ross university revenues increased by approximately million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the revenue gain is attributable to a increase in total student enrollments with the may semester and a tuition price increase of approximately effective with the september semester  and a price increase of slightly less than in january new and total student enrollments at ross university increased in both the january and may semesters  reversing a decline in enrollment in the september semester 
to prepare for future enrollment growth  medical school student capacity is being expanded with the leasing of additional space adjacent to the campus to be used as another auditorium for approximately students 
revenue from other sources during fiscal  other educational revenue increased by million  or  to million as compared to the prior year 
this line item consists of the sale of books and supplies in connection with devry s educational programs  including the commission income earned from follett  the sale of becker cpa review course materials on cd rom  and the sale of other cpa and cfa review study materials 
other components of other educational revenue are application and other non refundable student fees  and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances as discussed above 
interest income on devry s short term investments of cash balances increased by million 
the increase is due to generally higher levels of short term investments and higher short term interest rates for these investments as compared to the prior year 
costs and expenses sfas r devry adopted sfas r effective with the start of the first quarter of fiscal financial results for fiscal years and have been restated to reflect the modified retrospective approach of adoption 
accordingly  expenses relating to stock based awards have been included in the various expense categories for both years as appropriate 
sfas r establishes the accounting for stock based awards issued in exchange for employee services 
to date  all of devry s stock based awards have been granted in the form of stock options 
stock based compensation is measured at the grant date of the option  based on the fair value of the award 
the fair value is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period which is the period over which these options vest 
from the beginning of fiscal  devry s stock based awards were valued using a binomial model 
previously  these awards were valued using the black scholes model for purposes of pro forma disclosure pursuant 
table of contents to sfas and sfas the binomial model requires estimates of several important factors  eg expected life of an option  stock price volatility  risk free rate of return  forfeiture rate for options granted and the stock dividend yield 
the expected life of an option takes into account the contractual term of the option and the effects of the employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
devry has granted stock options to hundreds of employees over a period of time that extends back longer than the maximum ten year contractual life of most of its option awards and  therefore  has a history upon which estimates of the expected life of the option and the forfeiture rate can be based 
devry s stock has been publicly traded since and  therefore  there is a history upon which estimates of future stock price volatility can be determined 
in making its determination of the appropriate estimates  and for computing the actual valuation in a binomial model  devry engaged the assistance of an independent professional actuarial service 
cost of educational services devry s cost of educational services increased by million  or  from fiscal the largest component of cost of educational services is the cost of faculty and the staff that supports educational operations 
this expense category also includes the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities  and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
during fiscal  cost increases were incurred in support of the higher number of devry university centers and expanding online program enrollments 
for the spring term  courses were being offered at eight new devry university locations compared to a year ago  and the number of online coursetakers increased by approximately from last year to  also contributing to the higher cost of educational services was an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  primarily in the devry university undergraduate operations  as student receivables increased from last year through the summer and fall semesters 
however  at the start of the spring semester in march  the timeliness of receivable collections improved from prior periods as the result of internal process improvements which partially offset the increase in accounts receivable and the provision for doubtful accounts during the first part of the year 
partially offsetting these increases were the wage savings from workforce reductions implemented last year and continued spending restraint in operations during fiscal included in fiscal cost of educational services was a million workforce reduction charge  principally at devry university and million of severance related costs associated with devry s agreement with rcc college of technology for the final phases of the teach out of the toronto area campus programs 
there are no corresponding charges for workforce reductions in fiscal further savings in cost of educational services were generated by million of lower expense attributed to stock based awards as fewer new option grants have been issued this year compared to last year 
also  lower capital spending during each of the past several years has resulted in million of depreciation expense for fiscal compared to million last year 
most depreciation expense is included in the cost of educational services 
included in fiscal cost of educational services was a million impairment loss related to a devry owned building in the denver  colorado area which was sold in the current year 
student services and administrative expense student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal this expense category includes recruiting costs  general and administrative costs  expenses associated with curriculum development  and the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses 
the increased cost primarily reflects efforts to generate higher new student enrollments in all of devry s educational programs through improved and more efficient advertising and student recruiting 
admissions advisors have been added to support the growing online program enrollments and newly opened devry university centers and at ross university to offset the previous declines in new student enrollments 
increased new student enrollments  as described above  at devry university  becker professional review and ross university are believed to be  in part  attributable to the higher level and effectiveness of this spending 
all new student recruitment expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
largely offsetting these increases in student recruiting expense was lower amortization of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses including  most recently  ross university and chamberlain 
table of contents college of nursing 
amortization expense is included entirely in the student services and administrative expense category 
for fiscal  amortization expense for finite lived intangible assets was million compared to million in the year ago period 
also  workforce reduction costs included in the student services and administrative expense category totaled million in fiscal there are no corresponding workforce reduction program charges in the current year 
in addition  expense attributed to stock based awards included in the student services expense decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as fewer new option grants were issued in fiscal these decreases helped to partially offset the increases in student recruitment spending 
operating income devry university the devry university segment generated operating income of million in fiscal as compared to a million operating loss in fiscal as discussed above  the improvement in operating income was the result of improving enrollments  higher tuition rates and controlled spending 
devry realized additional savings from the consolidation of its online operations into a building in naperville  illinois  a nearby suburb to devry s headquarters location 
the acquisition of this building in fiscal permitted devry to relinquish some of its higher cost office space at the headquarters site 
in addition  devry university s canadian operation  which included the teach out cost for the former undergraduate toronto area campuses in fiscal  is no longer incurring further charges for the teach out activity 
in fiscal  devry university incurred operating losses of approximately million at its canadian operation 
in the current year  the canadian operations had a reduced operating loss of approximately million 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  operating income of million was another record high  increasing million from fiscal the increase in operating income is primarily due to increased revenue growth in fiscal as discussed above 
medical and healthcare operating income of million for the medical and healthcare segment increased by approximately million from fiscal at ross university  which is the dominant portion of this segment  an increase in student enrollments in january and may and tuition increases combined to produce the higher revenues and operating income for fiscal compared to last year even as faculty  staff and facilities are being added to accommodate future enrollment growth 
interest expense interest expense on devry s borrowings was million  an increase of million from fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to increases in short term interest rates partially offset by lower average borrowings during fiscal at june   the interest rate on devry s senior notes was  compared to one year earlier 
income taxes taxes on income were of pretax income for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the lower rate is primarily affected by the impact from stock based compensation expense deductibility partially offset by the relative proportions of us sourced income to income generated by ross university as compared to the prior year 
earnings of ross university s offshore operations are not subject to us federal or state taxes and also are exempt from income taxes in the jurisdictions in which the schools operate 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest ross university earnings and cash flow to eliminate the outstanding debt as of june   improve and expand facilities and operations at the medical and veterinary schools  and pursue other business opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  devry has not recorded a current provision for the payment of us income taxes on these earnings 

table of contents fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  revenues total consolidated revenue for fiscal of million declined from by million  or 
revenues are reported net of tuition refunds applicable to students who withdraw from the academic term for which they are enrolled during the period specified by the refund policy 
fiscal revenues increased in the professional and training segment  the medical and healthcare segment  and in the keller graduate school of management operations of devry university 
however  undergraduate enrollments at devry university were lower for each of the three semesters that began during fiscal year  which had an adverse effect on overall financial results 
the primary cause of decreased total enrollment was the continued decline in full time technology students  principally at the large campus locations 
revenue also declined during fiscal because devry university outsourced campus bookstore operations  as discussed more fully below 
devry university in the devry university segment  revenues of million declined from fiscal by million  or 
tuition revenues are the largest component of total revenues in the devry university segment 
the two principal factors that influence revenues are enrollment and tuition rates 
key trends in these two components are set forth below 
total undergraduate enrollment by term declined by from summer to summer  declined by from fall to fall  and declined by from spring to spring new undergraduate enrollment by term increased by from summer to summer  declined by from fall to fall  and increased by from spring to spring graduate coursetaker enrollment increased by during the six sessions of fiscal  and increased by from the july session to the july session 
tuition rates undergraduate program tuition increased by approximately in march and another in november  and graduate school program tuition increased by approximately for the january session total undergraduate enrollments were down during fiscal for two reasons 
first  new student enrollments declined during fiscal and the latter part of fiscal  leaving a smaller pool of existing students as we entered fiscal second  a greater proportion of undergraduate students are working adults who typically enroll for less than a full academic load 
working adults contributed to the increased undergraduate enrollments at devry university centers and in devry university online  but those increases were insufficient to offset declining total undergraduate enrollments primarily due to the shrinking field of recent high school graduates pursuing technology based programs 
to reverse the pattern of declining technology and full time student enrollments  we initiated additional marketing efforts  which reduced the year to year decline from to over the course of three semesters 
the increase in part time students and concurrent decline in full time students had a direct effect on fiscal revenues 
part time campus based undergraduate students pay a lower tuition amount each term than full time 
table of contents students 
therefore  the average tuition revenue per enrolled student has declined from previous years 
the increased tuition rate described above partially offset the decline 
another reason for the decline in devry university revenues in fiscal was that we outsourced management of campus bookstore and educational supply sales to follett higher education group  with follett taking over sales on devry campuses 
during fiscal  we completed an amended agreement calling for follett to assume responsibility for bookstores at the remaining nine campus locations and at devry university centers  and also to serve devry s online student population 
as a result of this transition  devry no longer reports sales revenue from our previously owned bookstores 
instead  we report the commission income devry receives on the sales follett makes to devry university students 
for fiscal  revenues from the sale of books and educational supplies at devry university declined by approximately million from fiscal  reflecting both lower student enrollments and the outsourcing arrangement 
despite this decline in reported revenues  there has been no significant effect on income since the commissions devry earns from follett approximate the profits the bookstores generated when devry managed them 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  revenues of million reached a record high  increasing by million  or from fiscal however  the primary reason for the increase was that revenues declined sharply during the third quarter of fiscal at becker professional s cpa exam operations because of a change in the cpa exam schedule and format 
in fiscal  with the new format exam offered on a regular schedule in each calendar quarter  the number of exam takers and enrollment in the becker review course rebounded sharply 
effective july   becker s fiscal year was realigned from its previous april year end to a june year end to make it consistent with the fiscal year for the rest of devry 
medical and healthcare revenues of million for the medical and healthcare segment include results of the chamberlain college of nursing from the acquisition date in march with approximately students enrolled at the time of acquisition  chamberlain revenues for the final three months of the fiscal year were approximately million 
during fiscal  ross university revenues increased by approximately million  or  largely as a result of a tuition increase of slightly less than eight percent implemented in january however  revenues for the may semester  which are recognized partly in fiscal and partly in fiscal  declined due to declining enrollment 
specifically  total enrollments at the medical and veterinary schools for the may semester declined by from fiscal because of changes to admissions standards and stricter academic progress policies for continuing students 
revenue from other sources other educational revenue declined by million  or  from fiscal these revenues consist primarily of the sale of books and supplies in connection with devry s educational programs  including the commission income earned from follett 
other components of other educational revenue are the sale of becker cpa review course materials on cd rom  the sale of other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable student fees  and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue declined because  as described above  follett took over the operations of the devry university bookstores 
interest income on devry s short term investments of cash balances increased by million during fiscal the increase is due to generally higher short term interest rates for these investments and the fact that  unlike in fiscal  devry used cash balances for investment earnings rather than to offset bank service fees 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of educational services devry s cost of educational services increased by million  or  from fiscal the largest component of cost of educational services is the cost of faculty and the staff that supports educational operations 
this expense category also includes the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities  and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
throughout fiscal  devry maintained spending restraint and implemented cost reductions in areas that management believes did not affect the quality of student services 
however  there have been cost increases to support the expanding number of devry university centers and growth in devry university online enrollments 
comparing spring to spring  courses were being taught at eight more devry university centers  and the number of online course takers increased by to  fiscal cost of educational services also includes approximately million of expense related to workforce reductions  principally at devry university  that were initiated during the year 
in addition  devry incurred workforce reduction costs of approximately million under our agreement with rcc college of technology for the final phases of the teach out of the toronto area campus programs  which is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of educational services increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher expense attributed to stock based awards as the amount of new options granted during fiscal increased in comparison to fiscal additions to land  buildings  and equipment during fiscal were million  as we continued to invest in new and improved laboratory and computer equipment  improve facilities for students and staff  and expand operations 
as a result  depreciation expense most of which is included in cost of educational services increased to million 
in addition  devry recognized a million pre tax impairment loss related to a building in the denver  colorado area that we acquired in as part of denver technical college 
although it is still used partly as classrooms and offices  this facility was offered for sale as it is no longer essential to devry s operations  having largely been replaced by a new and larger campus serving the denver market 
student services and administrative expense student services and administrative expense increased by million  or from last year 
included in this expense category are the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  expenses associated with curriculum development and the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses including  most recently  ross university and chamberlain college of nursing 
amortization expense during fiscal included in this expense category was million compared to million last year 
the higher student services and administrative expense also reflects greater efforts to generate more new student enrollments through increased advertising and student recruiting for all of devry s educational programs  particularly the devry university undergraduate programs 
additional admissions advisors were added during the year at both devry university in support of its growing online operations and at ross university s medical and veterinary schools 
all new student recruitment expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
management believes that reductions in technology field employment during the past several years has lessened applicant interest in these fields 
therefore  devry increased the level of recruitment activity to increase student enrollments  particularly at devry university 
devry believes that increased and more effective expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increase in new undergraduate student enrollment for the spring semester of fiscal  which increased by from the previous year 
costs of student recruitment efforts for the summer of fiscal are included in fiscal also contributing to the increase in student services and administrative expense is approximately million related to workforce reductions that were initiated during fiscal affecting employees whose wages were included in this expense category 

table of contents student services and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher expense attributed to stock based awards as the amount of new options granted during fiscal increased in comparison to fiscal during fiscal initial development work on the devry university new student information system was completed and the system was functionally deployed 
this new student information system provides better support for the educational processes and related student services 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting costs were capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communications  were charged directly to expense as incurred 
during fiscal  approximately million was capitalized for this project 
since initial development work was substantially completed by fiscal  no further amounts have been capitalized 
costs associated with further development and improvements to the system are being charged to expense as incurred 
cumulatively  a total of million was capitalized for this project 
all of the initial elements of the system have been placed into service and the capitalized costs are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  not exceeding five years 
for fiscal  a total of million of previously capitalized costs were amortized to expense 
these amounts compare to million that was capitalized during fiscal and million of previously capitalized costs that were amortized to expense 
in addition to the new student information system  devry implemented a new budgeting and forecasting system in fiscal to better manage the costs associated with the growing size and complexity of our operations 
approximately million of development costs were capitalized for this project during fiscal one of devry s directors is an investor in  and a director of  a consulting firm that we engaged to assist with system development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm were approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal operating income devry university the devry university segment recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to million of operating income in fiscal as discussed above  the primary cause of these lower earnings was a million reduction in revenue resulting  in part  from reduced total undergraduate student enrollments and a higher proportion of part time students 
higher enrollments and increased tuition at the keller graduate school partially offset the reductions at the undergraduate level 
however  as discussed above  cost of educational services and student services and administrative expense both increased 
although we curtailed spending on undergraduate campuses as enrollments declined  significant fixed costs of operation  such as facility related costs  cannot be reduced 
operating losses of approximately million in devry university s canadian operations  which include the operating losses associated with the final shutdown of the toronto area campus and the teach out agreement with rcc  were approximately million higher than in fiscal management believes that almost all costs associated with this shutdown have been recognized and operating results in canada should improve in the future 
professional and training in the professional and training segment  operating income of million was a then record high  more than doubling from fiscal in fiscal  the cpa exam format and schedule of exam offerings was changed 
fewer candidates took the test  and thus  fewer candidates enrolled in the becker cpa review course 
with the new cpa exam format and schedule effective for the entire fiscal year  enrollments and revenues rebounded 
effective with the beginning of fiscal year  the becker business cycle and fiscal year  which had previously ended in april to match the old cpa exam period  was changed to align with the june year end of devry inc with the new  nearly continuous  exam administration schedule  management concluded that the historical becker operating year is no longer appropriate 
this shift was implemented and reported in the first quarter of fiscal as a cumulative effect of change in accounting equal to million of after tax income  or approximately per share 
revenues and operating income for the professional and training segment in fiscal 
table of contents are reported for the same july through june period as the rest of devry uses 
in fiscal  revenues and operating income in this segment were reported for the period may through april medical and healthcare operating income for the medical and healthcare segment increased by approximately million from fiscal chamberlain college of nursing  which devry acquired at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  contributed approximately million of revenue during the fourth quarter  but had no significant effect on operating income 
although revenues increased  operating margins at ross university declined from in fiscal to approximately in fiscal there were three changes that  together  caused this decline 
first  faculty wages increased and ross had more faculty members 
second  additions and improvements to facilities at both the medical and veterinary schools resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of almost million in fiscal finally  ross increased its marketing support and added several admissions counselors in response to the reduced enrollments in the last two terms of fiscal  which increased student recruitment expense 
interest expense interest expense on devry s borrowings was million  an increase of million from fiscal fiscal borrowing levels were generally lower  but the interest rate on devry s borrowings is based upon short term interest rates  which increased significantly during the year 
at june   the interest rate on devry s senior notes was  compared to one year earlier 
income taxes taxes on income were of pretax income for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate declined because ross university s earnings made up a greater proportion of devry s total earnings 
earnings of ross university s offshore operations are not subject to us federal or state taxes and also are exempt from income taxes in the jurisdictions in which the schools operate 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest ross university earnings and cash flow to reduce outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations at the medical and veterinary schools  and pursue other business opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  devry has not recorded a current provision for the payment of us income taxes on these earnings 
application of critical accounting policies note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   describes in more detail the method of application of significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below 
revenue recognition devry university tuition and technology fees  ross university tuition for the basic science semesters  and chamberlain college of nursing tuition all are billed at the start of each academic term 
the revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over that academic term 
revenue from ross university clinical terms is recognized based upon the student s weekly schedule of actual attendance 
refunds of tuition and other charges are reported as a reduction of revenues 
textbook and other educational supply sales  and commissions we receive on such sales by follett  are recognized when the sale occurs 
tuition revenue from becker professional review is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the course term 
becker professional review self study cd rom and textbook and other educational product revenues are recognized when the sale occurs 
revenue from training services  which are generally short term in duration  is recognized when the training service is provided 

table of contents expense recognition advertising costs are charged to expense in the period in which materials are purchased or services are rendered 
similarly  start up expenses related to new operating locations and new curriculum development costs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined by analyzing the current level of accounts receivable and loss rates on collections of accounts receivable 
in addition  management considers projections of future receivable levels and collection loss rates 
we perform this analysis periodically throughout the year 
provisions required to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels are charged to expense in each period as required 
internally developed software selected costs associated with developing devry s information technology systems have been capitalized in accordance with the rules on accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
land  buildings  and equipment fixed asset acquisitions are recorded at cost 
depreciation  including depreciation on capitalized software development costs  is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
stock based compensation effective with the start of fiscal  stock based compensation is recorded as compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
financial results for fiscal years and have been restated to reflect the modified retrospective adoption 
accordingly  expenses relating to stock based awards have been included in the various expense categories  as appropriate 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in the application of sfas r in future periods  the stock based compensation expense that devry records may differ significantly from what was recorded in the prior period 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  management regularly compares the fair value of devry s reporting units to their carrying value to identify potential impairment of goodwill 
similarly  management compares the fair value to the carrying value of intangible assets arising from business combinations 
this assessment is performed annually  or more frequently if circumstances require  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist 
the valuation is based upon several factors  including estimates of future revenues and earnings and a discounted cash flow analysis for several future years  and includes other assumptions  such as future income tax and interest discount rates 
such estimates require significant judgment  and over future periods  actual results may differ from these estimates 
although management believes its estimates are appropriate  if earnings and or cash flow are less than our projections indicate  or other assumptions underlying the analysis change significantly  devry could incur impairment charges in future periods 
at june   intangible assets from business combinations totaled million  and goodwill totaled million 
together these assets equal approximately of total assets  and any impairment could significantly affect future results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets devry evaluates the carrying amount of its major long lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the value of such assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 

table of contents income tax liabilities devry recognizes income tax expense based upon income earned 
however  some expenses  such as depreciation  may be recorded in one period for financial statement reporting but in the tax return for another period 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the subsequent payment of these amounts 
devry s deferred tax items are regularly analyzed and valuation reserves are established as required when the realization of a deferred tax asset is in doubt 
estimates and assumptions devry s financial statements include estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses whose exact amounts will not be known until future periods 
management and devry s independent registered public accountants have discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the critical accounting policies discussed above and the significant estimates included in the financial statements in this report 
although management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  actual amounts may differ from the estimates included in the financial statements and could produce materially different results in the future 
devry s financial statements reflect the following significant estimates and assumptions the method of revenue recognition across the academic periods  the useful lives of equipment and facilities whose value is a significant portion of devry s total assets  the value and useful lives of acquired finite lived intangible assets  the value of indefinite lived intangible assets  the pattern of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets over their economic life  losses to be realized in the future on the collection of presently owed student receivable balances  costs associated with any settlement of claims and lawsuits in which devry is a defendant  health care reimbursement claims for medical services rendered but for which claims have not yet been processed or paid  and the value of stock based compensation awards and related compensation expense 
the methodology management used to derive each of the above estimates for fiscal is consistent with the manner in which such estimates were made in prior years  although management regularly analyzes the parameters used in setting the value of these estimates and may change those parameters as conditions warrant 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
contingencies devry is subject to occasional lawsuits  administrative proceedings  regulatory reviews associated with financial assistance programs and other claims arising in the normal conduct of its business 
the following is a description of pending litigation that may be considered other than ordinary and routine litigation that is incidental to the business 
in january  royal gardner  a graduate of one of devry university s los angeles area campuses  filed a class action complaint against devry inc and devry university  inc in the superior court of the state of california  county of los angeles  on behalf of all students enrolled in the post baccalaureate degree program in information technology 
the suit alleges that the program offered by devry did not conform to the program as it was presented in the advertising and other marketing materials 
in march  the complaint was dismissed by the court with limited right to amend and re file 
the complaint was subsequently amended and re filed 
during the first quarter of devry s fiscal year  a new complaint was filed in the same court by gavino teanio with the same general allegations and by the same plaintiffs attorneys 
this subsequent action was stayed pending the outcome of the gardner matter 
the parties have now reached a settlement which is in the process of being implemented as 
table of contents former students elect whether to participate in the settlement 
the total amount to be paid out will depend on how many former students elect to participate in the settlement 
the settlement amount is within the amount previously reserved for this matter 
in november  afshin zarinebaf  ali mousavi and another graduate of one of devry university s chicago area campuses filed a class action complaint in the circuit court for cook county  illinois  that alleges devry graduates do not have appropriate skills for employment in the computer information systems field 
the complaint was subsequently dismissed by the court  but was amended and re filed to include as a plaintiff mark macenas  a then current student in another curriculum from a second chicago area campus 
in september  the court denied the plaintiff s motion for class action certification in its entirety and the case was dismissed by the court 
the remaining pending claims by each of the named defendants were resolved by payment of less than  in june brigette dean hines  a former student of ross university veterinary school of medicine was dismissed from the school and denied re enrollment 
this former student claims that the dismissal was based upon her handicap and she is seeking compensatory damages for economic and non economic harm  punitive damages  cost of the suit  attorney s fees and other relief deemed appropriate by the court 
ross university filed a motion to dismiss the suit which was denied and discovery will proceed 
sierra bay contractors  the contractor that built the student dormitory building on the devry university fremont  california  campus has placed a lien on the site and filed a counterclaim to devry s claim for contract breach  alleging that devry has failed to pay for extra work done in building the dormitory 
in addition  some of the sub contractors have also filed liens on the site  seeking additional payments owed to them by the general contractor 
the total amount claimed for the extra work is approximately million 
discussions are underway to try and resolve these claims 
additional costs of construction  if any  arising from the settlement of these claims would be capitalized as a part of the cost of the building construction and would not result in any immediate additional expense 
accordingly  no accrual has been made for this claim 
saro daghlian  a former student at a california devry university campus  brought a putative class action suit in the california state district court for the county of los angeles alleging that devry s materials distributed to students did not comply with california state statutes including a california education code requirement to provide a specified statement to prospective students concerning the transferability of credits 
the case was removed to federal court  and a motion to dismiss was filed 
the motion to dismiss was denied  and discovery is proceeding 
the total accrual for the resolution of all pending legal claims and for final payment on claims previously resolved was approximately million at the end of fiscal while the ultimate outcome of pending contingencies is difficult to estimate at this time  devry does intend to vigorously defend itself with respect to the pending claims 
at this time  devry does not believe that the outcome of current claims  administrative proceedings  regulatory reviews and lawsuits will have a material effect on its cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources student payments devry s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition  books  educational supplies and fees 
these payments include funds originating as student and family educational loans  other financial aid from various federal  state and provincial loan and grant programs  and student and family financial resources 
the pattern of cash receipts during the year is somewhat cyclical 
devry s accounts receivable peak immediately after bills are issued each semester 
at devry university  the principal undergraduate semesters begin in july  november and march  but we offer shorter eight week session courses that begin in september  january and may 
these shorter sessions have the effect of somewhat smoothing the cash flow peaks throughout the year as they represent a new revenue billing and collection cycle within the longer semester cycle 
collections of student receivables generally peak during the first half of each academic period  reaching seventy to eighty percent of collections for that entire period 
these early collections exceed operating expenses for 
table of contents the semester so they provide sufficient cash flow for operations at the end of the semester when collections are lower 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level at the end of the semester  dropping to their lowest point during the year at the end of june 
this is when devry university undergraduate spring semester  the keller graduate school may term  and the student financial aid year all come to an end and substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed 
ross university experiences a similar operating pattern  but its semesters begin in may  september and january  thus smoothing the cyclical pattern of cash flows from devry university 
the becker cpa review operation historically had two major term starts per year  but the change to an on demand cpa exam format beginning in april produced a new and somewhat smoother enrollment and cash flow pattern throughout the year 
at june   total accounts receivable  net of related reserves  were million  compared to million last year 
some of the higher receivables can be attributed to the revenue growth across our business segments 
the largest receivables increase occurred at becker  with a million increase in net receivables driven by becker s strong fourth quarter revenue gain versus last year and the impact of additional large public accounting firms with direct billing arrangements with inherently longer collection cycles 
devry university and keller graduate school net receivables increased by and million  respectively 
these increases are due to higher tuition rates  extended payment plans for the growing number of adult and military students at devry  and an increased proportion of part time students whose financial aid eligibility is less than that of full time students 
reserves for uncollectible accounts for both undergraduate and graduate student receivables were increased throughout the year to reflect devry s collection experience on balances owed 
to reduce the level of interim student financing under the devry university undergraduate educard program  many students participate in supplementary loan programs funded by private lenders 
the supplementary loans are aimed at students whose federal and state funded financial aid is not sufficient to cover all their costs of education 
devry has entered into a limited default risk sharing arrangement for some of these loans 
at june   devry had reserved for and recognized as expense the full amount of devry s share of the default risk 
financial aid devry is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds at devry university  ross university and chamberlain college of nursing 
management estimates that approximately of its devry university undergraduate students tuition  book and fee revenues have been financed by government provided financial aid to students 
keller graduate school collections from student participation in federal loan programs have increased during the past several years and are now approximately of revenues 
ross university collections from student participation in federal loan programs are approximately of revenues at both the medical and veterinary schools 
all financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained in the future 
in addition  government funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in both the united states and canada 
like any other educational institution  devry s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding 
previous department of education and state regulatory agency program reviews have not resulted in material findings or adjustments against devry 
under the terms of devry s participation in financial aid programs  certain cash received from state governments and the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
devry receives these funds either after the financial aid authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student is completed  or just prior to that authorization 
once the authorization and disbursement process for a particular student is completed  the funds may be transferred to unrestricted accounts and become available for devry to use in current operations 
this process generally occurs during the academic term for which such funds were authorized 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted bank accounts  compared to million at june  
table of contents as described in more detail in item description of business  institutions must meet a financial responsibility test if their students participate in federal financial assistance programs 
the department of education relies on a test that considers equity  primary reserve  and net income ratios  with a minimum required score of in  devry received notice from the department of education that its financial responsibility ratios yielded a composite score of for the year ended june  the primary reason for this deficient score was that the department of education calculation included intangible assets from the ross university acquisition 
because of this deficiency  certain restrictions were imposed on devry university s procedures for submitting requests for financial aid funds for its students 
these restrictions did not require devry to significantly alter its existing practices 
devry s composite score has exceeded the required minimum since june  so all restrictions on our operations have been lifted 
management has calculated devry s composite score at june   and determined that it exceeds management believes devry can continue to demonstrate the required level of financial stability 
cash from operations cash generated from operations in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal while net income increased by million compared to last year  cash generated from operations was only up million 
higher cash flows from an increase in net income and deferred tuition revenue was partially offset by lower non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization  and the stock based compensation charge 
also  partially offsetting some of the higher cash flow was a million lesser source of cash compared to the prior year for changes in levels of prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
variations in the levels of accrued expenses and accounts payable from period to period are caused  in part  by the timing of the year end relative to devry s payroll and bill payment cycles 
capital expenditures capital spending on improvements  including instructional technology and expansion  is an integral component of devry s operating strategy 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal driven by lower spending at devry university 
over the past four years  devry has invested over million for expansion  facility improvement  and the replacement and improvement of teaching and administrative equipment along with school laboratories for its educational program offerings 
for fiscal  management expects capital expenditures to increase to a level more in line with prior years which is needed to support future growth 
although there are no new large devry university campus sites planned or under construction  there are further facility expansion plans at both the ross university medical and veterinary schools 
other new or expanded operating locations are expected to be in leased facilities  thus requiring less capital spending 
on september   devry sold its west hills campus for million 
proceeds from the sale will be used to pay income taxes attributed to the gain on the sale  closing costs  reduce debt and for general corporate purposes 
lending arrangements in may  in conjunction with its acquisition of ross university  devry terminated its existing revolving loan agreement and entered into two new loan agreements a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks  and senior notes held by a group of insurance company lenders 
these vehicles provided funding for the ross acquisition and now support devry s ongoing working capital needs 
all borrowings and letters of credit issued under the new agreements are through devry and global education international gei  an international subsidiary 

table of contents the following table summarizes the terms of the two agreements and their status as of june  revolving credit agreement  as amended in september devry inc gei borrowing limit million  with option to increase to million million interest rate at devry s discretion  either the prime rate or a eurodollar rate plus  depending upon the achievement of certain financial ratios

approximately million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit agreement support participation by devry university  chamberlain school of nursing  and ross university in student financial aid programs 
most of the letters of credit expire in one year or less 
no amount has ever been drawn under the letter of credit issued on behalf of devry 
devry and gei are not required to repay any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement or under the senior note agreements until their respective maturity dates  but we can make prepayments without penalty at any time 
in july  devry prepaid the million gei senior notes without penalty 
other contractual arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal  devry entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately  of its current borrowings from sharp increases in the prevailing short term interest rates 
these agreements expired during the first quarter of fiscal devry intends to periodically evaluate the need for future interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and borrowing levels 
devry s only long term contractual obligations consist of its revolving line of credit  the senior notes  operating leases on facilities and equipment  and agreements for various services 
at june   there were no required payments under devry s borrowing agreements prior to their maturity 
however  in the first quarter of fiscal  devry prepaid million of its long term debt  and it may make additional prepayments during the remainder of fiscal  but is under no contractual obligation to do so 
required payments under non cancelable operating leases with a term in excess of one year are million for fiscal and million for fiscal 
table of contents devry is not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements  nor are there any unconsolidated subsidiaries 
devry has not extended any loans to any officer  director or other affiliated person 
devry has not entered into any synthetic leases  and there are no residual purchase or value commitments related to any facility lease 
devry has not entered into any derivative  swap  futures contract  put  call  hedge or non exchange traded contract except for the now expired interest rate cap agreements noted above 
under the terms of those interest rate cap agreements  devry did not incur any further payment liability beyond their original purchase price 
as of the end of the fiscal year  devry had posted more than million of surety bonds to various governmental jurisdictions on behalf of devry university and becker professional review in the united states  and approximately cdn million in canada 
the surety bonds are related primarily to student recruiting and educational operations 
if devry were to fail to meet its obligations in these jurisdictions  it could be responsible for payment up to the amount of the related bond 
to date  no surety bond has ever been paid because devry failed to meet its obligations 
a summary of devry s contractual obligations at june   is presented below due in less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt operating leases employment agreement other long term obligations total cash obligations devry s consolidated cash balances of million at june   include approximately million of cash attributable to the ross university offshore operations 
devry intends to indefinitely reinvest this cash and subsequent earnings and cash flow to eliminate gei s remaining outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations of the ross university  and pursue future business opportunities outside the united states 
in accordance with this plan  cash held by ross university will not be available for general corporate purposes 
management believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  the revolving loan facility  will be sufficient to fund both devry s current operations and current growth plans for the foreseeable future unless future significant investment opportunities  similar to the acquisition of ross university  should arise

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk devry is not dependent upon the price levels  or affected by fluctuations in pricing  of any particular commodity or group of commodities 
however  more than of devry s costs are in the form of employee wages and benefits 
changes in employment market conditions could cause devry to experience cost increases at levels beyond what it has historically experienced 
the financial position and results of operations of ross university s caribbean operations are measured using the us dollar as the functional currency 
substantially all ross university financial transactions are denominated in the us dollar 
the financial position and results of operations of devry s canadian educational programs are measured using the canadian dollar as the functional currency 
the canadian operations have not entered into any material long term contracts to purchase or sell goods and services  other than the lease agreement on a teaching facility 
devry does not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
because canada based assets constitute less than of our overall assets  and our canadian liabilities constitute a similarly small percentage of our overall liabilities  changes in the value of canada s currency at rates experienced during the past several years are unlikely to have a material effect on devry s results of operations or financial position 
based upon the current value of the net assets in the canadian operations  a change of in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would result in a translation adjustment of less than  devry s customers are principally individual students enrolled in our various educational programs 
accordingly  concentration of accounts receivable credit risk is small relative to total revenues or accounts receivable 
devry s cash is held in accounts at various large  financially secure depository institutions 
although the amount on deposit at a given institution typically will exceed amounts subject to guarantee  devry has not experienced any deposit losses to date  nor do we expect to incur such losses in the future 
the interest rate on devry s debt is based upon libor interest rates for periods typically ranging from one to three months 
based upon our borrowings at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
however  future investment opportunities and cash flow generated from operations may affect the level of outstanding borrowings and the effect of a change in interest rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  devry entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately  of current borrowings from sharp increases in the prevailing short term interest rates 
these agreements expired during the first quarter of fiscal devry intends to periodically review further debt repayment and evaluate the need for future interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates  borrowing levels  working capital  and investment requirements
