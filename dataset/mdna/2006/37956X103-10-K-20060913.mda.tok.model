item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as  among others  our dependence on a limited number of contracts for a high percentage of our revenues and the risks associated with operating in international markets 
these risks and others are more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview our business is global and subject to technological and business trends in the telecommunications marketplace 
it is also affected by geopolitical developments involving areas of the world in which our customers are located  particularly in developing countries and areas of the world involved in armed conflicts 
our business had been adversely affected by the global economic slowdown from and  in particular  the significant challenges facing the telecommunications industry worldwide 
we continue to see improvement in the segments we serve  in particular within the us government and government related entities marketplace 
since our products and services are often sold into areas of the world which do not have fiber optic land based networks  a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from  and are expected to continue to be derived from  developing countries 
these countries carry with them more enhanced risks of doing business than in developed areas of the world  including the possibility of armed conflicts or the risk that more advanced land based telecommunications will be implemented over time 
revenues related to contracts for ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions and data communications services have been fixed price contracts in a majority of cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business is frequently concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contract costs generally include purchased material  direct labor  overhead and other direct costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized  as they become known 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials including shipping and handling costs  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel and living costs and subcontractor salaries 
costs from data communications services consist primarily of satellite space segment charges  voice termination costs  network operations expenses and internet connectivity fees 
satellite space segment charges consist of the costs associated with obtaining satellite bandwidth the measure of capacity used in the transmission of services to and from the satellites leased from operators 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of the network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis  including personnel and related costs and depreciation 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  finance  contract and administrative functions 
critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  for our production type contracts that are sold separately as standard satellite ground segment systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred and the contractual performance specifications have been met 
our standard satellite ground segment systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically short term less than twelve months in term and manufactured using a standard modular production process 
such systems require less engineering  drafting and design efforts than our long term complex production type projects 
revenue is recognized on our standard satellite ground segment systems upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing which is when title transfers to the customer 
the amount of revenues recorded on each standard production type contract is reduced by the customer s contractual holdback amount  which typically requires to of the contract value to be retained by the customer until installation and final acceptance is complete 
the customer generally becomes obligated to pay to of the contract value upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the system since installation does not require significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment  does not require complex software integration and interfacing and we have not experienced any difficulties installing such equipment 
in addition  the customer or other third party vendors can install the equipment 
the estimated relative fair value of the installation services is determined by management  which is typically less than the customer s contractual holdback percentage 
if the holdback is less than the fair value of installation  we will defer recognition of revenues  determined on a contract by contract basis equal to the fair value of the installation services 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until shipment and are presented as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  for our non standard  complex production type contracts for the production of satellite ground segment systems and equipment that are generally integrated into the customer s satellite ground segment network 
the equipment and systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically long term in excess of twelve months in term and require significant customer specific engineering  drafting and design effort in order to effectively integrate all of the customizable earth station equipment into the customer s ground segment network 
these contracts generally have larger contract values  greater economic risks and substantive specific contractual performance requirements due to the engineering and design complexity of such systems and related equipment 
progress payments received in advance by customers are netted against the inventories balance 
the timing of our revenue recognition is primarily driven by achieving shipment  final acceptance or other contractual milestones 
project risks including project complexity  political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate  export restrictions  tariffs  licenses and other trade barriers which may result in the delay of the achievement of revenue milestones 
a delay in achieving a revenue milestone may negatively impact our results of operations 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions costs related to our production type contracts and our non standard  complex production type contracts rely on estimates based on total expected contract costs 
typically  these contracts are fixed price projects 
we use estimates of the costs applicable to various elements which we believe are reasonable 
our estimates  are assessed continually during the term of these contracts and costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
these estimates are subjective based on management assessment of project risk 
these risks may include project complexity and political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate 
revisions in cost estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
a significant revision in an estimate may negatively impact our results of operations 
in the event an estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred at completion  we record the loss as it becomes known 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the reporting unit level 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow method to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the excess is required to be recorded as an impairment charge 
the impairment test is dependent upon estimated future cash flows based upon management estimates of the data communication services segment 
our impairment test as of april  indicated that no impairment existed 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
an assessment of the inherent risks in conducting our business with foreign customers is also made since a significant portion of our revenues is international 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist primarily of work in progress from costs incurred in connection with specific customer contracts  which are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make estimates of the total contract costs based on the various elements of the work in progress 
it is possible that changes to these estimates could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of our inventories 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased infrastructure sales in the us government and government related entities marketplace coupled with increased sales due to an overall improvement in the telecommunications industry segments we serve offset by a decrease in sales at globecomm systems europe limited 
due to this decrease in revenues and our assessment of our uk subsidiary  we liquidated globecomm systems europe limited on june  and have continued our uk presence through our uk representative office 
revenues from data communications services 
revenues from data communications services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  in our managed network service offerings we had increases of in telephony  in internet and data and in vsat multi mode  coupled with an increase in life cycle support in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue and corresponding increase in gross margin in the data communication services segment has been a key driver in the increase in our consolidated income from operations 
the future relationship between the revenue growth of our operating segments will depend on a variety of factors  including the timing of major contracts  which are difficult to predict 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was attributable to the higher revenue base

net income for the company s fiscal fourth quarter of approximately million included a net non recurring gain of approximately million  which represented a million gain included in costs from data communications services related to the reversal of previously recorded fixed asset depreciation  offset by a million charge for the accelerated vesting of options 
we may experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in our consolidated results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
see section entitled risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  net accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  offset by million in accounts payable  million in deferred revenue and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended june  was million  which primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the increase in revenues  a decrease in deferred revenues of million due to timing differences between project billings and revenue recognition milestones resulting from specific customer contracts offset by net income of million  an increase in accounts payable of million relating to the increase in revenue and timing of vendor payments  and a non cash item representing depreciation and amortization expense of million primarily related to the network operations center and satellite earth station equipment 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million  which related to the purchase of million of fixed assets primarily for our network operations center and teleport primarily related to the content delivery and telephony service offerings 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million which related to million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants 
we have a credit agreement in place which provides for a working capital line of credit of up to million  which expires in november the line of credit bears interest at the prime rate and is collateralized by a first security interest on all of our personal property 
the credit agreement allows us to borrow and apply letters of credit against the availability under the line of credit 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants  deposit requirements  monthly reporting provisions and other requirements  as defined in the credit agreement  with which we were in compliance at june  as of june   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility  however  there were standby letters of credit of approximately million  which were applied against and reduced the amounts available under this credit facility 
we lease satellite space segment services and other equipment under various operating lease agreements  which expire in various years through fiscal future minimum lease payments due on these leases through june  are approximately million 
we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for operating activities will increase as we continue to implement our business strategy 
management anticipates additional working capital requirements for work in progress for orders as obtained and that we may periodically experience negative cash flows due to variances in quarter to quarter operating performance 
in particular  we have been awarded a large program that will require significant capital expenditures for the teleport and network operations center during the year ending june  we anticipate this program will be in service in july we will use existing working capital and or obtain external financing to meet these additional working capital requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the ground segment systems  networks and data communications services business  the nature and timing of customer orders and the level of capital requirements related to the expansion of our service offerings 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements at least through june  however  we cannot assure you that there will be no unforeseen events or circumstances that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
for example  future events occurring in response to the hostilities in iraq and afghanistan  or in connection with any armed conflict  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against the united states or its allies or military or trade or travel disruptions impacting our ability to sell and market our products and services in the united states and internationally may impact our results of operations 
unexpected events negatively impacting international commerce  including additional conflicts in the middle east  could defer our ability to close contracts with international customers 
additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  capital expenditures and research and development activities and we may be required to reduce headcount 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands

related party transactions during january  pursuant to a letter agreement  we combined the then outstanding loan and advances receivable from an individual who is a former executive officer and a current employee into a million promissory note 
under the terms of the letter agreement we will forgive the outstanding principal and interest amounts due on the promissory note in five annual installments beginning in january so long as the former executive officer remains an employee  subject to the terms of the letter agreement 
in march  the company forgave the third installment under the promissory note

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we may utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
at june   we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in money market funds with portfolios of investment grade corporate and government securities 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
