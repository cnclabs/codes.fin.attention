risk factors forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee and similar expressions  are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include those described under risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  among others  many of which are beyond our control 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking  and specifically decline to undertake  any obligation to address or update each or any factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results  and we are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes in information contained in previous filings or communications 
though we have attempted to list comprehensively these important cautionary risk factors  we wish to caution investors and others that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our business or results of operations 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking information contained in this annual report on form k 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operations  industry or financial position or our future financial performance 
while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business  there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business  operations  industry  financial position and financial performance in the future 
cyclicality and commodity prices 
industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey 
profitability in the chicken and turkey industries is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens and turkeys or deliver products 
the cost of corn  our primary feed ingredient  increased significantly from august to the date of this report  and there can be no assurance that the price of corn will not continue to rise as a result of  among other things  increasing demand for corn products around the world and alternative uses of corn  such as ethanol production 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  in some instances  to enter into advance purchase commitments or financial hedging contracts for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
however  we may not hedge feed ingredient cost risk unless requested by a specific customer or it is otherwise deemed prudent and any use of such instruments may not be successful 
livestock and poultry disease  including avian influenza 
outbreaks of livestock diseases in general and poultry diseases in particular  including avian influenza  can significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 
we take reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreaks of disease  either in our own flocks or elsewhere  could significantly affect demand for our products or our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  turkey or other products to or from our suppliers  facilities or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could also result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation and prospects 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  during the first half of fiscal  there was substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza  known as hn  which has been affecting asia since and which has recently been found in eastern europe 
it is widely believed that hn is being spread by migratory birds  such as ducks and geese 
there have also been some cases where hn is believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans came into contact with live birds that were infected with the disease 
although highly pathogenic hn has not been identified in north america  there have been outbreaks of low pathogenic strains of avian influenza in north america  including in the us in and  and in mexico outbreaks of both high and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza is a fairly common occurrence  including this year  which have impacted our operations 
historically  the outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza have not generated the same level of concern  or received the same level of publicity or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for poultry products in certain countries as that recently associated with the highly pathogenic hn strain 
accordingly  even if the highly pathogenic hn strain does not spread to north or central america  there can be no assurance that it will not materially adversely affect demand for north or central american produced poultry internationally and or domestically  and  if it were to spread to north or central america  there can be no assurance that it would not significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and or demand for our products  in each case in a manner having a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and or prospects 
contamination of products 
if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
poultry products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms  or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and generic e 
coli 
these pathogens are generally found in the environment  and  as a result  there is a risk that they  as a result of food processing  could be present in our processed poultry products 
these pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
these risks may be controlled  although not eliminated  by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing 
we have little  if any  control over proper handling once the product has been shipped 
illness and death may result if the pathogens are not eliminated at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and prospects 
in october  one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria 
we later received information from the usda suggesting environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  we carried insurance designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by the recall 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  product liability 
product liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators 
the packaging  marketing and distribution of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity 
we may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury  illness or death 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or damage to the products 
in addition to the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by our production or processing operations  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to perform product recalls  or that product liability claims will not be asserted against us  in the future 
any claims that may be made may create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as described above under contamination of products  if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
in october  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october  in connection with this recall  we were named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits brought by individuals alleging injuries resulting from contracting listeria monocytogenes 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any litigation or reputational injury associated with this or any future product recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
our business operations entail a number of risks  including risks relating to product liability claims  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons 
we currently maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks  including product liability insurance  property insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance  but in many cases such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events  or at all 
moreover  even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events  it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events 
for example  the losses attributable to our october recall of cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities significantly exceeded available insurance coverage 
additionally  in the past two of our insurers encountered financial difficulties and were unable to fulfill their obligations under the insurance policies as anticipated and separately two of our other insurers contested coverage with respect to claims covered under policies purchased  forcing us to litigate the issue of coverage before we were able to collect under these policies 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including in the health  safety and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
also  changes in laws or regulations or the application thereof may lead to government enforcement actions and the resulting litigation by private litigants 
we are aware of an industry wide investigation by the wage and hour division of the us department of labor to ascertain compliance with various wage and hour issues  including the compensation of employees for the time spent on such activities such as donning and doffing work equipment 
we have been named a defendant in several related suits brought by employees 
due  in part  to the government investigation and the recent us supreme court decision in ibp  inc v 
alvarez  it is possible that we may be subject to additional employee claims 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
significant competition 
competition in the chicken and turkey industries with other vertically integrated poultry companies  especially companies with greater resources  may make us unable to compete successfully in these industries  which could adversely affect our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
in both the us and mexico  we primarily compete with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us poultry industry include price  product quality  brand identification  breadth of product line  and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that competition is based on product quality  brand awareness  customer service and price 
further  there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the prepared food business 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
additionally  the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   required annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november   the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action was warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry were eliminated in january in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff was reduced on january  to and is to be reduced in each of the following two years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
as those tariffs are reduced  increased competition from chicken imported into mexico from the us may have a material adverse effect on the mexican chicken industry in general  and on our mexican operations in particular 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  loss of key customers 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers could adversely affect our business 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  and our largest customer  wal mart stores inc  accounted for of our net sales 
our business could suffer significant set backs in revenues and operating income if we lost one or more of our largest customers  or if our customers plans and or markets should change significantly 
potential acquisitions 
we intend to pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  which could increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions 
additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions may harm our financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions may be structured in such a manner that would result in the assumption of unknown liabilities not disclosed by the seller or uncovered during pre acquisition due diligence 
for example  our acquisition of the conagra chicken division was structured as a stock purchase 
in that acquisition we assumed all of the liabilities of the conagra chicken division  including liabilities that may be unknown 
similarly  the acquisition of gold kist would likely expose us to unknown liabilities 
these obligations and liabilities could harm our financial condition and operating results 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  leverage 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt securities 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition which could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain necessary financing and to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and sell assets  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
if additional debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
the completion of our proposed acquisition of gold kist would increase our indebtedness substantially 
proposed acquisition of gold kist 
a number of risks are associated with our proposed acquisition of gold kist  and the consummation of an acquisition would increase certain risks we now face 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  the gold kist board has rejected our offer to purchase gold kist and commenced litigation that is intended to prevent the acquisition 
gold kist has not made available to us materials for due diligence 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete the proposed acquisition of gold kist or obtain detailed due diligence materials 
further  if we acquire gold kist  there are no assurances that we can effectively integrate gold kist s business or realize the associated cost savings and operating synergies currently anticipated 
additionally  the acquisition of gold kist would increase our indebtedness substantially 
foreign operations risks 
our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
we have significant operations and assets located in mexico and may participate in or acquire operations and assets in other foreign countries in the future 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past 
exchange rate fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our operations in mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws of mexico 
we may rely in part on intercompany loans and distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our claims 
additionally  the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make payments and distributions to us will be subject to  among other things  mexican law 
in the past  these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions 
however  laws such as these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future 
control of voting stock 
control over pilgrim s pride is maintained by members of the family of lonnie bo pilgrim 
as described in more detail in item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters  through two limited partnerships and related trusts and voting agreements  lonnie bo pilgrim  patty r 
pilgrim  his wife  and lonnie ken pilgrim  his son  control of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  they control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of pilgrim s pride or its assets 
this ensures their ability to control the foreseeable future direction and management of pilgrim s pride 
in addition  an event of default under certain agreements related to our indebtedness will occur if lonnie bo pilgrim and certain members of his family cease to own at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock

on september   plaintiffs amended their lawsuit to join tyson foods  inc as a co defendant 
two additional former chicken growers were also added as plaintiffs to the lawsuit 
this amendment  which occurred months after the lawsuit s initial filing  virtually re wrote most of the allegations

in the us  we produce both prepared and fresh chicken and fresh turkey  while in mexico and puerto rico we exclusively produce fresh chicken 
through vertical integration we control the breeding  hatching and growing of chickens 
we operate in three business segments and two geographical areas 
executive summary overview 
focus and concern abroad over avian influenza significantly reduced international demand for chicken products during fiscal when compared to the prior year  leading at times to higher inventory levels and contributing to lower overall market pricing 
at the same time  industry production levels continued to increase  creating an oversupply situation and further weakening prices 
industry wide inventories of leg quarters reached extremely high levels during the first nine months of fiscal due to reduced purchasing in foreign markets 
leg quarter inventory levels began falling at the beginning of our third fiscal quarter and by the end of such quarter had reached levels comparable to the end of the third quarter of fiscal and remained at comparable levels as of september  additionally  the oversupply of leg quarters put significant pressure on the us white meat markets which contributed to historically low breast meat prices 
while leg quarter pricing improved substantially throughout most of fiscal  breast meat pricing after attempting to recover earlier in the year began declining in the fourth quarter and  as of the date of this report  reached near all time lows and was substantially lower than the prior year 
during fiscal  the average market pricing for chicken leg quarters and breast meat declined approximately and  respectively  from the prior year 
additionally  our us chicken sales volume for fiscal was less than last year due primarily to the effects of avian influenza concerns in the international markets 
this change in pricing and demand adversely affected our results for fiscal additionally  some us customers have renegotiated their contracts with us to reflect the current pricing environment for chicken 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  in addition  the cost of corn  our primary feed ingredient  increased significantly from august to the date of this report 
there can be no assurance that the price of corn will not continue to rise as a result of  among other things  increasing demand for corn products around the world and alternative uses of corn  such as ethanol production 
we will attempt to pass through the expected higher feed costs through contract negotiations with our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these increased costs can be recovered 
in response to this challenging operating environment  we have executed a multi point plan designed to improve our competitive position first  we have delayed one half of our planned expansion in the fresh food service division of our mayfield  kentucky plant from early july until mid september of this year  and the other half of this expansion from early july until june second  beginning on july   we reduced our weekly slaughter rate by approximately  which is equivalent to approximately  head per week 
in addition  we recently announced a further reduced weekly slaughter to achieve a year over year decline  which is equivalent to approximately million head per week  beginning in january we currently intend to keep this reduction in slaughter in effect until we believe that the average industry profit margins have returned to a more normalized level 
third  we reduced our capital investments for fiscal to million 
our original capital investment projection for the year had been in the range of million 
our estimated range for fiscal is million 
we are focusing only on those projects we deem critically necessary to our business or those in which our immediate investment is judged by us to be in our best long term interests 
fourth  we have sharpened our focus on reducing costs and operating more efficiently 
we intend to continue to monitor market conditions for purposes of determining when we believe further changes in our business are prudent 
results 
the net loss for fiscal of million is down million from net income of million for fiscal this decrease is primarily due to reduced selling prices for chicken primarily created by market disruptions caused by the avian influenza scares in other parts of the world 
reduced selling prices for our mexico produced chicken partially offset by an increase in pounds sold in mexico 
increased cost of sales due to higher energy and packaging costs 
tax expense of million related to the restructuring of our mexico operations and subsequent repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of business environment profitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations  which can be mitigated somewhat by pilgrim s pride corporation september  business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared foods products 
prepared foods products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduces the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of sales  representing approximately of our consolidated cost of sales in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the us and foreign governments 
the cost of corn  our primary feed ingredient  increased significantly from august until the date of this report  and there can be no assurance that the price of corn will not continue to rise as a result of  among other things  increasing demand for corn products around the world and alternative uses of corn  such as ethanol production 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
as a significant portion of the us poultry production is exported  the commodity prices of chicken and turkey can be  and in recent periods have been  adversely affected by disruptions in poultry export markets 
these disruptions are often caused by restrictions on imports of us produced poultry products imposed by foreign governments for a variety of reasons  including the protection of their domestic poultry producers and allegations of consumer health issues 
for example  russia and japan have restricted the importation of us produced poultry for both of these reasons in recent periods 
in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff rate was reduced on january  to and is scheduled to be reduced in each of the following two years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
the tariff was imposed due to concerns that the duty free importation of such products as provided by the north american free trade agreement would injure mexico s poultry industry 
as such tariffs are reduced  we expect greater amounts of chicken to be imported into mexico from the us  which could negatively affect the profitability of mexican chicken producers and positively affect the profitability of us exporters of chicken to mexico 
although this could have a negative impact on our mexican chicken operations  we believe that this will be mitigated by the close proximity of our us operations to the mexico border 
we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which gives us a strategic advantage to capitalize on exports of us chicken to mexico 
because these disruptions in poultry export markets are often political  no assurances can be given as to when the existing disruptions will be alleviated or that new ones will not arise 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  business segments we operate in three reportable business segments as a producer and seller of chicken products  a producer and seller of turkey products and a seller of other products 
in previous years  our presented segments included chicken and other and turkey 
after fully integrating the fiscal acquisition into our operations during fiscal and early fiscal  we changed our segment presentation to separate our non chicken and non turkey operations into a separate category consistent with management s evaluation of operating results and decisions with respect to the allocation of resources 
our chicken segment includes sales of chicken products we produce and purchase for resale in the us  including puerto rico  and mexico 
our chicken segment conducts separate operations in the us  puerto rico and mexico and is reported as two separate geographical areas 
substantially all of the assets and operations of the fiscal acquisition are included in our us chicken segment since the date of acquisition 
our turkey segment includes sales of turkey products we produce and purchase for resale in our turkey and distribution operations in the us our other products segment includes distribution of non poultry products that are purchased from third parties and sold to independent grocers and quick service restaurants 
also included in this category are sales of table eggs  feed  protein products and other items  some of which are produced by the company 
inter area sales and inter segment sales  which are not material  are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer sales 
corporate expenses are allocated to mexico based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the us portions of the segments based on number of employees 
assets associated with our corporate functions  including cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities  are included in our chicken segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to our distribution centers are allocated based on the proportion of net sales to the particular segment to which the product sales relate 
depreciation and amortization  total assets and capital expenditures of our distribution centers are included in our chicken segment based on the primary focus of the centers 
non recurring recoveries  which represent settlements for vitamin and methionine litigation covering several periods as well as federal compensation for avian influenza  have not been allocated to any segment because the proper allocation cannot be readily determined

all available funds had been borrowed at september  we also maintain operating leases for various types of equipment  some of which contain residual value guarantees for the market value of assets at the end of the term of the lease 
the terms of the lease maturities range from one to seven years 
we estimate the maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is approximately million  however  the actual amount would be offset by any recoverable amount based on the fair market value of the underlying leased assets 
no liability has been recorded related to this contingency as the likelihood of payments under these guarantees is not considered to be probable and the fair value of the guarantees is immaterial 
we historically have not experienced significant payments under similar residual guarantees

cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreases in our net income in fiscal and higher inventories

cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million and million for the fiscal years and  respectively

among other considerations  we have not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities as based upon the likelihood of payment  the fair value of such indemnities is immaterial 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  our loan agreements generally obligate us to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes i any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of  deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan  ii any tax  duty or other charge with respect to the loan except standard income tax or iii capital adequacy requirements 
in addition  some of our loan agreements contain a withholding tax provision that requires us to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party  generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law 
these increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction  and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts we could be obligated to pay under such provisions 
any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default  and  in a secured financing transaction  would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer programs and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes and product recall accounting 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment and transfer of ownership of the product to the customer and is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged back to net sales in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  inventory 
live poultry inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeder hens at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or market 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventory and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts 
this primarily includes leg quarters  wings  tenders and offal  which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost 
generally  the company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or market adjustments are required based on a number of factors  including i pools of related inventory  ii product continuation or discontinuation  iii estimated market selling prices and iv expected distribution channels 
if actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  remaining length of service and estimated salvage values ii estimated fair market value of the assets and iii determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment test  generally groupings of related operational facilities 
litigation and contingent liabilities 
the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  including legal defense costs  if any  for these contingencies is made when losses are determined to be probable and reasonably estimatible and after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to favorable or adverse judgments  changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure

the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  purchase price accounting 
the company allocates the total purchase price in connection with acquisitions to assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values 
for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for significant acquisitions  the company has historically relied upon the use of third party valuation experts to assist in the estimation of fair values 
historically  the carrying value of acquired accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable have approximated their fair value as of the date of acquisition  though adjustments are made within purchase price accounting to the extent needed to record such assets and liabilities at fair value 
with respect to accrued liabilities  the company uses all available information to make its best estimate of the fair value of the acquired liabilities and  when necessary  may rely upon the use of third party actuarial experts to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities  primarily self insurance accruals 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
taxes are provided for international subsidiaries based on the assumption that their earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and as such deferred taxes are not provided for in us income taxes that would be required in the event of distribution of these earnings  except that we provide deferred taxes on the earnings of international subsidiaries that we intend to repatriate or otherwise deem are not indefinitely reinvested 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of the individual operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
the company has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it nevertheless has established tax reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the company resulting in additional liabilities for tax and interest 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  marketable equity security prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients 
we purchase certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  we will from time to time lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
we do not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of september  based on our feed consumption during fiscal  such an increase would have resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million 
pilgrim s pride corporation september  foreign currency 
our earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of our mexico subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure primarily by attempting to minimize our mexican peso net monetary position  but from time to time  we have also considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
such instruments  however  have historically not been economically feasible 
we are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the us however  we currently anticipate that the majority of the future cash flows of our mexico subsidiaries will be reinvested in our mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our results of operations and financial position in several ways  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations resulting from a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos  was a loss of million in fiscal  a gain of million in fiscal  and a loss of million in fiscal on september   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  compared to at october  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt instruments 
we had variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of our long term debt at september  holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a basis points increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by million for fiscal these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate long term debt at september market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of september   using discounted cash flow analysis 
impact of inflation 
due to low to moderate inflation in the us and mexico and our rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period
