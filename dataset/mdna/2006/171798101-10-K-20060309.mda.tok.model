item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction cimarex energy co 
is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
our operations are presently focused primarily in oklahoma  texas  new mexico  kansas  louisiana  and the gulf of mexico 
we also have smaller projects underway in michigan  north dakota and california 
our primary focus is to explore for and discover new reserves 
to supplement our growth  we also consider mergers and acquisitions 
on june   cimarex acquired magnum hunter resources  inc  a dallas based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico and in the gulf of mexico 
terms of the merger agreement provided that magnum hunter stockholders receive shares of cimarex common stock for each share of magnum hunter common stock 
as a result of the merger  cimarex issued million common shares to magnum hunter s common stockholders excluding million shares held in treasury and assumed million of debt 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase of magnum hunter by cimarex 
results of operations from magnum hunter s properties are included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning june  as a result of the merger  our proved reserves tripled and production doubled 
our common shares outstanding increased by percent to million and we went from having no debt to taking on million of debt 
using proceeds from property sales and cash flow in excess of second half capital investments  we reduced our debt to million by year end 
operationally we now have a large base of properties in the permian basin with operational characteristics similar to our mid continent assets 
the merger also extended our onshore gulf coast activities into the gulf of mexico 
overall  about percent of our proved reserves are in the permian basin and percent are in our mid continent region 
our onshore gulf coast and gulf of mexico operations collectively make up percent of our proved reserves 
industry and economic factors in managing our business we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is wide fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
historically  oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  with future price movements difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in prices often have the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  the interpreter still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reservoirs being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within the industry are substantial and usually move up and down together with prices 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas companies  and individual operators 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial  commercial and residential end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to comprehensive environmental regulations 
compliance with these regulations increases the cost of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating  and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth of our assets will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves 
to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we maintain a blended portfolio of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we believe that this approach allows for consistent increases in our oil and gas reserves  while minimizing the chance of failure 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we may also consider the use of transaction specific hedging of oil and gas prices to reduce price risk 
to date the use of hedging has not been implemented by cimarex 
however  in connection with the acquisition of magnum hunter  we acquired existing commodity derivatives as discussed more fully below 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities  periodic sales of non core properties and external sources of capital 
we project that exploration and development expenditures will approximate billion  up from the million invested in approximately percent of the expenditures will be in the permian basin  percent in the mid continent area  percent in the gulf coast area and percent in the gulf of mexico 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled million  which more than funded our drilling program 
proceeds from properties sold during totaled million 
we used the proceeds from property sales and cash flow in excess of capital investment to eliminate all of the million of bank debt that magnum hunter had outstanding immediately prior to our merger 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  reserves and properties  as well as goodwill and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from oil and gas sales are recognized based on the sales method  with revenue recognized on actual volumes sold to purchasers 
there is a ready market for oil and gas  with sales occurring soon after production 
we market and sell natural gas for working interest partners under short term sales and supply agreements and earn a fee for such services 
revenues are recognized as gas is delivered and are reflected net of gas purchases on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of reserve estimates resulted in an increase of mbbls of oil and an increase of bcf of gas  representing less than half of a percent and one percent of proved oil and gas reserves  respectively  as of december  see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for reserve data 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
changes in reserve quantities will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision or  in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
to date  changes in expense resulting from changes in previous estimates of reserves have not been material 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  are also capitalized 
under full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes and excluding costs not subject to amortization  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
cash flows used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  future prices  and the costs to extract these reserves 
downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed oil and gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit and excluding costs not subject to amortization  the excess must be charged to expense 
this is referred to as the full cost ceiling limitation 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even if higher oil and gas prices subsequently increase the full cost ceiling limitation 
at the end of each quarter  a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment assessment 
a more frequent assessment is required if certain events occur that reasonably indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the volatility of oil and gas prices may cause more frequent assessments 
the impairment assessment requires us to make estimates regarding the fair value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value is based on numerous factors  including future net cash flows of our estimates of proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves 
these factors are each individually weighted to estimate the total fair value of goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss must be performed  with any deficiency recorded as an impairment 
we recorded million of goodwill in the purchase of key on september  and million of goodwill in the purchase of magnum hunter on june  to date  no related impairment has been recorded 
allocation of purchase price the allocation of the magnum hunter purchase price to oil and gas properties utilized prevailing oil and gas prices at the time of negotiations and announcement of the merger 
the overall allocation of the purchase price is preliminary because certain items such as the determination of the final fair value of certain assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date have not been finalized 
the goodwill amount related to the magnum hunter purchase as of december  has been adjusted downward to million from the original amount recorded of million  as the valuation process continues 
derivatives sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we generally determine the fair value of futures contracts and swap contracts based on the difference between the derivative s fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date using information we obtain from counter parties 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded as an expense 
in connection with the magnum hunter merger  cimarex recognized a million net liability associated with magnum hunter s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
these derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  cimarex recognized in earnings during a net loss of million 
this charge includes both non cash mark to market derivative losses as well as cash settlements 
cash payments related to these contracts that settled in totaled million 
the net derivative liability at december  equals million 
cimarex will continue to recognize gains and losses in future earnings until the derivative instruments mature on december  contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
as of december   we have accrued for a mediated million litigation settlement pertaining to post production deductions on properties operated by cimarex 
the proposed settlement will be reviewed by the court in the first quarter of for approval 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
oil and gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation to employees for fiscal periods after june  this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb proposed new staff positions on applying statement of financial accounting standards sfas no r  share based payment 
the proposed rules establish that determining the grant date of a share based payment is presumed to be satisfied at the date the award is approved under relevant corporate governance requirements  as long as the recipient is unable to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award  and the award s key terms are expected to be communicated to the recipient within a relatively short period of time after the date of approval 
the new rule would become effective when an entity adopts r  or  if already adopted  in the first reporting period beginning after the staff position is finalized 
the fasb also proposed a simpler alternative to the calculation of the amount of excess tax benefits available in additional paid in capital apic to absorb tax deficiencies that occur after adopting r 
companies would have up to one year after adopting r to decide whether to elect the alternative computation method 
overview our results of operations are primarily impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and changes in our production volumes 
realized oil and gas prices increased from per barrel and per mcf in to per barrel and per mcf in gas marketing revenues  net of related costs  pertain to sales of gas on behalf of third parties that are incidental to sales of our own production 
sales and costs associated with our production are reflected in gas sales and transportation expense 
we also own interests in gas gathering systems and gas processing plants that are connected to our production operations 
we transport and process third party gas that is associated with our gas 
transportation expenses are comprised of costs paid to carry and deliver oil and gas to a specified delivery point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
production costs are composed of lease operating expenses  which generally consist of pumpers salaries  utilities  water disposal  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
taxes  other than income  are taxes assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices 
while we expect such costs to increase with our growth  we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
expenses related to the merger are costs associated with the magnum hunter transaction 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no

basis of presentation cimarex was formed in february as a wholly owned subsidiary of helmerich payne  inc h p 
as a result of a dividend declared and paid by h p on september   in the form of cimarex common stock  cimarex was spun off and became a stand alone company 
also on september   cimarex acquired percent of the outstanding common stock of key production company  inc key in a tax free exchange 
in june  cimarex acquired magnum hunter resources  inc  by issuing shares of cimarex common stock for each share of outstanding magnum hunter common stock  resulting in the issuance of million cimarex common shares 
at december   cimarex had million shares outstanding 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase of magnum hunter by cimarex 
the results of operations of magnum hunter were included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning june  certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
most notably  the presentation of gas marketing and sales activities as discussed under revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements

the results of operations of magnum hunter are included in our consolidated statements of operations only for the period since the acquisition on june  oil and gas sales for the year of totaled billion  compared to million for the million increase in sales between the two periods results from million related to higher commodity prices and million due to higher production volumes due primarily to increased production resulting from the acquisition of magnum hunter 
realized gas prices averaged per mcf for  compared to per mcf for this percent change increased sales by million between the two periods 
realized oil prices averaged per barrel for  compared to per barrel for the increase in sales between periods resulting from this percent improvement in oil prices totaled million 
changes in realized prices were the direct result of overall market conditions 
sales also benefited from higher production volumes 
average gas volumes rose mmcf per day in to mmcf per day from mmcf per day in  resulting in million of incremental revenues 
oil volumes averaged  barrels per day for  compared to  barrels per day in  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the increase in sales volumes between the periods of and is due to positive drilling results during and  and the inclusion of production from magnum hunter operations from june  production volumes in the gulf of mexico and along the texas and louisiana gulf coast area were negatively impacted during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of hurricanes 
it is estimated to have negatively impacted fourth quarter production by to mmcf equivalent per day and full year volumes by to mmcf equivalent per day 
at year end  approximately mmcf equivalent was still shut in 
it is anticipated that most of the remaining shut in volumes will be restored by the end of the first quarter of the timetable to restore full production largely depends on the startup of refineries  gas processing plants  platforms  facilities and pipelines owned and operated by others 
no oil and gas reserves have been lost as a result of the storms and essentially all associated repair costs will be covered by insurance 
gas gathering and processing revenues  net of related costs  equaled million in  compared to a loss of million in the increase is due to the inclusion of related activities from magnum hunter operations from june  we own interests in gas gathering systems and gas processing plants that are connected to our production operations 
we transport and process third party gas that is associated with our gas 
gas marketing net revenues decreased to million from million  net of related costs of million and million for and  respectively

dd a equaled million in compared to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the increase largely stems from costs associated with magnum hunter operations and higher costs for reserves added during and another large component of the increase in costs and expenses between periods was the loss on derivative instruments 
prior to the acquisition of magnum hunter  cimarex did not use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price changes 
in connection with the merger  we recognized a million net liability associated with magnum hunter s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
these derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  cimarex recognized in earnings during a net loss of million 
the charge includes both non cash mark to market derivative losses as well as cash settlements 
cash payments related to these contracts that settled in totaled million 
the net derivative liability at december  equals million 
cimarex will continue to recognize mark to market gains and losses as well as amortization of these contracts in future earnings until the derivative instruments mature 
production costs rose million from million 
per mcfe in to million 
per mcfe in the higher costs in resulted primarily from the inclusion of costs associated with magnum hunter operations  higher field operating expenses from an expanded number of properties and higher maintenance costs 
transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of expiring contracts being renewed with increased current market rates and the inclusion of transportation costs associated with magnum hunter operations 
taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in the increase between periods resulted from increases in oil and gas sales stemming from inclusion of magnum hunter operations  higher production volumes and commodity prices 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase between periods is due to an expansion of staff and higher employee benefit costs 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock option awards 
stock compensation increased from million in to million in due primarily to the million expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r as of january  as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share option compensation awards granted under our stock incentive plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized pro rata over a weighted average period of five years 
as of december   expenses associated with the magnum hunter merger totaled million 
of the million  million is due to the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock units resulting from change of control provisions under our stock incentive plan becoming effective due to the magnum hunter merger 
the remaining million consists of million of general integration costs  million for retention bonuses  and million of related financing costs 
net interest expense in of million is comprised of million of interest expense  offset by million of capitalized interest resulting from interest recognized on borrowings associated with costs incurred to bring properties under development  not being amortized  to their intended use and million of amortization of fair value of debt 
this has increased from million of interest expense in the additional components of the net interest amount and the increase from results from amounts associated with the debt assumed in the magnum hunter merger 
prior to the magnum hunter merger  cimarex had no outstanding debt 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of percent and percent in and  respectively

these sales for equaled million  compared to million in the million increase in sales between the two years consists of million related to higher oil and gas prices  and million associated with increased production volumes 
realized gas prices averaged per mcf for  compared to per mcf for this percent increase had an incremental effect on sales of million between the two years 
realized oil prices averaged per barrel for  compared to per barrel for the effect on sales between years resulting from this percent improvement in oil prices totaled million 
higher prices were the direct result of overall market conditions 
oil and gas sales also benefited from higher production volumes 
average gas volumes rose mmcf per day in to mmcf per day from mmcf per day in  resulting in million of incremental revenues 
oil volumes averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the increase in overall sales volumes between the two years is due to positive drilling results during average daily production contributed from wells drilled during totaled mmcfe  which largely offset natural declines 
gas gathering and processing revenues  net of related costs  equaled a loss of million in both and  respectively 
we own interests in gas gathering systems and gas processing plants that are connected to our production operations 
we transport and process third party gas that is associated with our gas 
the financial impact from these activities is small relative to our overall results of operations 
gas marketing net revenues increased to million from million  net of related costs of million and million for and  respectively 
gas marketing revenues  net of related costs  pertain to sales of gas on behalf of third parties that is incidental to sales of our own production 
the marketing margin in was favorably impacted by wide fluctuations in gas prices 
costs and expenses overall costs and expenses not including gas gathering  processing and marketing activities were million in compared to million in the largest component of this million increase between years is a million increase in total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a from million in to million in  resulting from higher costs for reserves added during on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for production costs rose million from million in to million in due primarily to the installation and operation of additional compressors primarily in kansas to enhance production  higher field operating expenses from an expanded number of properties  and higher maintenance costs 
taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in this increase resulted from a percent jump in oil and gas sales stemming from higher product prices and volumes 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in  due to an expansion of staff as a result of a larger drilling program  higher employee benefit costs  and higher consulting fees 
other income and expense  net equaled million in  consisting of million of net gains from the sale of inventory  million of net gains from the settlement of various litigation  and million of interest income  versus million of interest income in smaller variances of costs between years include stock compensation related to amortization of costs of restricted stock  increasing by million from million in to million in  and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations  increasing by million from million in to million in asset retirement obligations were recorded with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of percent and percent in and  respectively 
the increase in effective rates results from greater utilization of tax credits in we estimate that million of our income tax expense is current 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our primary source of capital is cash flow generated from operating activities 
prices we receive for oil and gas sales and our level of production will impact these future cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices we will receive 
production volumes will in large part be dependent upon the amount and results of future capital expenditures 
in turn  actual levels of capital expenditures may vary due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices and availability of goods and services  and the extent to which proved properties are acquired 
cash flow provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million for the increase in from the earlier period resulted primarily from higher oil and gas production and prices and the acquisition of magnum hunter 
higher revenues from oil and gas sales facilitated the funding of our exploration and development expenditure program for cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to million for the increase in stemmed from a larger exploration and development program 
cash flow used in financing activities in was million versus million provided in the cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the payment of million on debt including million of capital lease debt assumed in the magnum hunter acquisition  offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises 
financial condition as of december   stockholders equity totaled billion  up from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from billion of common stock issued in connection with the magnum hunter acquisition  net income of million and million of fair value of common stock associated with the convertible debt assumed in the magnum hunter merger 
at december  our cash balance equaled million 
in december  the board of directors declared the company s first quarterly dividend of 
per share payable to shareholders of record as of february  also in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of common stock 
through december    shares had been repurchased at an average price of 
since december  and through february  an additional  shares have been repurchased for an average price of per share 
working capital working capital at december  totaled million  compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in cash and an increase in current derivative liability 
our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables during the period presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 
financing prior to the magnum hunter merger  cimarex had no outstanding debt 
in connection with the merger on june   cimarex assumed the following debt in thousands bank debt capital lease obligations notes due face value  floating rate convertible notes due face value  less current portion of capital lease obligations total long term debt debt at december  consisted of the following in thousands 
bank debt notes due face value of  floating rate convertible notes due  at december  face value of  total long term debt paid in its entirety in august fair market value at june  fair market value at june  reflected in paid in capital is million related to the fair value of common stock associated with the convertible debt 
fair market value at date of acquisition less amortization of the premium of fair market value over face value 
we have the capability to borrow on a senior secured revolving credit facility 
on june   cimarex entered into a new revolving credit facility that provides for million of long term committed credit  with a borrowing base of million 
effective november   cimarex s borrowing base  as determined by its lenders in accordance with certain provisions under the credit agreement  was increased to billion 
the new facility is scheduled to mature on july  and is secured by mortgages on certain oil and gas properties and the stock of certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
the credit facility agreement contains both financial and non financial covenants  including limitations on share repurchases  dividends and other restricted payments 
the financial covenants require cimarex to maintain a minimum ratio of funded indebtedness to trailing twelve month ebitda earnings before interest  taxes and dd a adjusted for non cash items associated with mark to market accounting  stock based compensation and impairment of goodwill of less than three times and a ratio of current assets plus unused commitments to current liabilities of greater than one 
cimarex continues to comply with these covenants and does not view them as materially restrictive 
at the company s option  advances under the credit facility bear interest based upon a base rate or a eurodollar rate 
the base rate means the greater of a the jp morgan chase bank prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent 
the eurodollar rate means the applicable british bankers association london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from percent depending on the borrowing base usage 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  unused commitments under the agreement are subject to a commitment fee ranging from percent  also depending on the borrowing base usage 
cimarex currently has a letter of credit posted against its borrowing base of million that reduces funds available under the credit facility 
the letter of credit is un drawn and was posted to cover future plugging and abandonment costs and potential environmental remediation costs associated with a certain producing property located in new mexico 
the notes assumed in the magnum hunter merger have a face value of million and are due march  the notes are unsecured and are redeemable  as a whole or in part  at cimarex s option  on and after march  at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount  plus accrued interest  if any  thereon to the date of redemption 
year percentage and thereafter the floating rate convertible senior notes were assumed in the magnum hunter merger and mature on december  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate equal to three month libor  reset quarterly 
on december   the interest rate was reset to 
holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock has been trading above the fixed conversion price of per share 
on december   the closing price of our common stock traded on the new york stock exchange was 
if any holders of the notes elect to tender their notes for conversion  they are entitled to receive a conversion value approximately equal to the ten day average closing value of our common stock times we would then deliver the conversion value as follows an amount of cash equal to the lesser of a the conversion value or b the principal amount of the notes and an amount of common shares equal in value to the conversion value less the principal amount of the notes net shares 
at december   the maximum total net shares that the holders would be entitled to if they all elected to tender their notes was million 
at december   utilizing an average common stock price of  the conversion value equaled million or  per bond 
there is not an observable market for the notes 
management estimates the fair value of the notes at december  was million or  per bond 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the common stock component of the convertible debt has been included in stockholders equity 
in addition to the holders right to redeem the notes if our common stock price is above the conversion price  the holders also have the right to require cimarex to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest on december   and the indenture agreement also provides cimarex with an option to redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest anytime after december  all long term debt is guaranteed by cimarex and its subsidiaries  except canvasback 
assets held by canvasback consist primarily of thousand shares of cimarex stock  which is included in cimarex s treasury stock

the construction loan bears interest at either libor plus or a base rate plus and will mature no later than july  total borrowings under this loan at december  were million  of which our share was million 
we have provided a guarantee to the lender for this construction loan 
in return for our guarantee  we received an up front fee as well as the right to receive of distributable cash flows from apple tree until certain financial tests are met 
in the event that the construction loan goes into default and we have to perform under the guarantee  we will have recourse against the project and related subsidiaries 
we have included thousand in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet to represent the fair value of our guarantee issued for the construction loan 
contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt fixed rate interest payments commodity derivatives operating leases drilling commitments asset retirement obligation other liabilities see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
at december   we had a firm sales contract to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next five months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered 
however  we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our reserves and current production levels 
cimarex has other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million 
all of the commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing line of credit will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and exploration and development activities 
outlook our projected exploration and development expenditure program of approximately billion will require a great deal of coordination and effort 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our drilling operations  we believe our projected program has a high degree of occurrence 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts in these areas warrant pursuit of the projects 
costs of operations on a per mcfe basis for are estimated to approximate levels realized in late should factors beyond our control change  our program and realized costs will vary from current projections 
these factors could include volatility in commodity prices  changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  weather conditions  governmental regulations and more 
production estimates for range from to mmcfe per day 
revenues will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices being less than they were in is high 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk price fluctuations our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for oil and gas production  and those prices are constantly changing in response to market forces 
nearly all of our revenue is from the sale of oil and gas  so these fluctuations  positive and negative  can have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
monthly gas price realizations during ranged from per mcf to per mcf 
oil prices ranged from per barrel to per barrel 
it is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we generally determine the fair value of futures contracts and swap contracts based on the difference between the derivative s fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded as an expense 
in connection with the magnum hunter merger  cimarex recognized a million net liability associated with magnum hunter s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
these derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  cimarex recognized in earnings during a net loss of million 
this charge includes both non cash mark to market derivative losses as well as cash settlements 
cash payments related to these contracts that settled in totaled million 
the net derivative liability at december  equals million 
actual gains and losses to be recognized in the future may differ materially  arising from movements in the prices of oil and natural gas 
cimarex will continue to recognize gains and losses in future earnings until the derivative instruments mature 
actual gains and losses to be recognized may differ materially from current fair value estimates 
the following is a summary of the company s open derivative contracts as of december  commodity type volume day duration weighted average price fair value s natural gas collar  mmbtu jan dec crude oil collar  bbl jan dec weighted average nymex prices at december for approximate per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
any sustained weakness in prices may affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for exploration and development and could cause us to record a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
interest rate risk fixed and variable rate debt 
cimarex assumed fixed and variable rate debt as part of the acquisition of magnum hunter 
these agreements expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates
