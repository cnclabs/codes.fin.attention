item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors in part i  item a above 
business overview we design  develop and market innovative networking products that address the specific needs of small business and home users 
we are focused on satisfying ease of use  reliability  performance and affordability requirements of these users 
our product offerings enable users to share internet access  peripherals  files  digital multimedia content and applications among multiple personal computers  or pcs  and other internet enabled devices 
we sell our networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  wholesale distributors  dmrs  vars  and broadband service providers 
we have well developed channels in the united states and emea and are building a strong presence in the asia pacific region 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales 
international sales as a percentage of net revenue grew from in to in sales in europe  middle east and africa  or emea  grew from million in to million in  representing an increase of approximately during that period 
we continue to penetrate new markets such as belgium  china  eastern europe  india  italy  japan  norway  russia  and the netherlands 
our net revenue grew during the year ended december   with strong growth coming from sales of our wireless lan products to the home market  especially the new rangemax family of products and continued strength in g and super g products as well as increased gross shipments of our broadband gateways 
we have also had continued success in obtaining cost reductions and efficiencies from our vendors and manufacturers  and have pursued product redesigns when appropriate to further lower productions costs 
these decreasing costs  coupled with slowing in the decrease of average selling prices  boosted our margins on our older products  especially our g and super g wireless adapters 
the small business and home networking markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect our competition to continue to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the small business and home markets for networking products include product breadth  size and scope of the sales channel  brand name  timeliness of new product introductions  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  ease of installation  maintenance and use  and customer service and support 
to remain competitive  we believe we must invest significant resources in developing new products  enhancing our current products  expanding our channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 

table of contents our gross margin improved to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a favorable shift in product mix and our product costs decreasing relatively more quickly than sales prices  offset by an increase in end user customer rebates and other sales incentives which reduce revenue along with increased freight and conversion costs 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million or of net revenue and million or of net revenue for the year ended december  net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have listed below our critical accounting policies which we believe to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time the product is shipped provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of the company s international customers  title passes to the customer upon delivery to the port or country of destination or upon their receipt of the product  and for selected retailers in the united states to whom the company sells directly  title passes to the customer upon their receipt of the product or upon the customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company estimates and defers revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
the revenue continues to be deferred until such time that title passes to the customer 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different if our management made different judgments and estimates 
allowances for returns due to stock rotation and warranty  price protection  end user customer rebates  other sales incentives and doubtful accounts in addition to warranty related returns  certain distributors and retailers generally have the right to return product for stock rotation purposes 
every quarter  stock rotation rights are limited to of invoiced sales to the distributor or retailer in the prior quarter 
upon shipment of the product  the company reduces revenue for an estimate of potential future product warranty and stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  namely warranty and stock rotation returns 
revenue on shipments is also reduced for estimated price protection and end user rebates and other sales incentives deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
our estimated allowances for returns due to stock rotation and warranty  and price protection can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we record estimated reductions to revenues for end user customer rebates at the later of when the related revenue is recognized  or when the program is offered to the end consumer 
often qualified purchasers choose not to apply for the incentives or fail to follow the required redemption guidelines  resulting in an incentive redemption rate of less than 
based on historical data  we estimate a rebate redemption rate for our promotional programs and book the related reduction to revenue accordingly 
should actual redemption rates differ from our estimates  additional revenue reductions may be required 
sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  the company accrues for sales incentives as a marketing expense if it receives an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
our estimated provisions for sales incentives can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional expenses or additional revenue reductions dependent on the classification of the sales incentive 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments  including consignment inventory  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months to determine what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our analysis is based on the demand forecast but takes into account market conditions  product development plans  product life expectancy and other factors 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
as demonstrated during  and  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax versus accounting of certain items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to tax credits  state taxes  stock compensation and other factors 
our future effective tax rate could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income  tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions  changes in tax laws in the united states or internationally  a change which would 
table of contents result in a valuation allowance being required to be recorded  or a federal  state or foreign jurisdiction s view of tax returns which differs materially from what we originally provided 
we assess the probability of adverse outcomes from tax examinations regularly to determine the adequacy of our income tax liability 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be

and net changes in deferred revenue 
fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we continue to experience our seasonal pattern of higher net revenues in the second half of the year 
the increase in revenue was especially attributable to higher sales of wireless lan products to the home market  especially the new rangemax family of products and continued 
table of contents strength in g and super g products  as well as increased gross shipments of our broadband gateways 
these revenue increases were partially offset by increases in allowances made for end user customer rebates and other sales incentives associated with increased retail product sales 
we were able to slow down the pace of erosion in our average selling prices on our relatively older products in in part due to our new minimum advertised price policy with our us retailers  as well as a general slowdown in competitive pricing pressures 
end user customer rebates and other sales incentives advertising  end caps and cooperative marketing programs which are classified as reductions in net revenue increased in  especially in the latter half of when we took advantage of significant strategic joint promotion opportunities with our biggest retail partners both in the us and in europe 
for example  we co marketed our new rangemax family of products with us national retailers using a unified advertising campaign involving ad circulars and new end cap displays 
these increases in spending combined with higher use of end user customer rebates impacted our revenue growth 
for the year ended december  revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year comparable period for each region was  and  respectively 
fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was attributable to increased gross shipments of our broadband and wireless products  partially offset by increases in allowances made for rebates and cooperative marketing programs associated with increased retail product sales  sales returns and price protection 
for the year ended december  revenue generated within the united states  emea and asia pacific was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year comparable period for each region was  and  respectively 
the increase in all regions was attributable to increased shipment of broadband and wireless products and ethernet switches  due in part to the continuous introduction of new products into all channels 
cost of revenue and gross margin year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data cost of revenue cost of revenue percentage of net revenue amortization of deferred stock based compensation percentage of net revenue total cost of revenue gross margin percentage cost of revenue consists primarily of the following the cost of finished products from our third party contract manufacturers  overhead costs including purchasing  product planning  inventory control  warehousing and distribution logistics  and freight  warranty costs associated with returned goods and write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin 
our gross margin is also affected by other factors  including sales returns  changes in net revenues due to average selling prices  end user customer rebates and other sales incentives and changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in warranty and 
table of contents overhead costs  prices paid for components  net of vendor rebates  freight in  conversion costs and charges for excess or obsolete inventory and transitions from older to newer products 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   an increase of percentage points 
this increase was due primarily to a favorable shift in product mix and our product costs decreasing relatively more quickly than sales prices  offset by an increase in end user customer rebates and other sales incentives  which reduce revenue along with increased freight and conversion costs 
we were able to slow down the pace of erosion in our average selling prices on our relatively older products in in part due to our new minimum advertised price policy with our us retailers  as well as a general slowdown in competitive pricing pressures 
we have also had continued success in obtaining cost reductions and efficiencies from our vendors and manufacturers  and have pursued product redesigns when appropriate to further lower production costs 
these decreasing costs  coupled with the relative slowing in the decrease of average selling prices  boosted margins on our older products  especially our g and super g wireless adapters 
additionally  we have benefited from relatively higher standard margins on newer products  especially from our rangemax family of products 
it is difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products across our markets and within specific countries 
the shift in the mix of actual orders compared to forecasted demand resulted in a higher than normal reliance on more expensive air versus surface freight during the last quarter of as well as higher rework and other costs primarily related to product conversions among country specific packaging 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this improvement in gross margin of was due primarily to a favorable shift in product mix and relatively lower product costs  as well as operational efficiency and supply chain management 
we also earned rebates and prompt payment discounts from our suppliers  which increased million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an improvement of in gross margin 
these improvements in gross margin were partially offset by an increase in cooperative marketing costs and end user rebates  as well as additional allowances to write down inventory resulting from anticipated warranty returns 
cooperative marketing costs and end user rebates are recorded as a reduction in net revenue 
operating expenses research and development expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data research and development expense percentage of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  payments to suppliers for design services  tooling design costs  safety and regulatory testing  product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets  prototypes and other consulting fees  and product certification fees paid to third parties 
research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred 
we have invested in building our research and development organization to allow us to introduce innovative and easy to use products 
we expect to continue to add additional employees in our research and development department 
in the future we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand into new networking product technologies  enhance the ease of use of our products  and broaden our core competencies including the opening of a test lab in beijing  china 

table of contents research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased salary and payroll related expenses of million resulting from research and development related headcount growth 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  these headcount increases were primarily due to the expansion of our research and development facility in taiwan and expansion of our focus on the broadband service provider market which often requires additional certifications and testing 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased product development costs of  and increased salary and payroll related expenses of  resulting from research and development related headcount growth  as evidenced by our opening of our engineering center in taiwan which accounted for nine additional employees  representing of our worldwide research and development staff as of december  sales and marketing expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data sales and marketing expense percentage of net revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  trade shows  corporate communications and other marketing expenses  personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  product marketing expenses and technical support expenses 
we believe that maintaining and building brand awareness is key to both net revenue growth and maintaining our gross margin 
we also believe that maintaining widely available and high quality technical support is key to building and maintaining brand awareness 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future  related to the planned growth of our business 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to product promotion  including intensified in store staffing and training programs  advertising  and outside technical support expenses  all in support of increased volume 
in addition  salary and related expenses for additional sales and marketing personnel increased by million as a result of sales and marketing related headcount growth from employees as of december  to employees as of december  we attributed of the incremental employee additions to expansion in emea and apac  where sales and marketing employee headcount grew and  respectively 
the increase was also attributable to additional allocated overhead costs such as facilities and information systems costs amounting to  which reflects sales and marketing s larger relative headcount growth rate and correspondingly higher share of overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to product promotion  advertising  outside technical support expenses incurred in support of the increased sales volume  and increased operating costs in international locations due to the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro and the british pound 
in addition  salary and related expenses for additional sales and marketing personnel increased by million resulting from sales and marketing related headcount growth  especially due to expansion in the emea and asia pacific regions  and freight out charges increased by million primarily in support of higher revenue 

table of contents general and administrative expense year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except percentage data general and administrative expense percentage of net revenue general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and accounting  human resources  professional fees  allowance for bad debts  and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars related to the growth of the business as well as to fund the set up of our ireland international operations center in to support our growing international business 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fees for professional services aggregating million and a decrease in net allocated overhead such as information systems costs aggregating  offset by an increase in employee related costs of million 
the decrease in fees for professional services resulted from decreases in consulting  outsourced accounting fees and legal fees  and costs associated with initial sarbanes oxley compliance documentation in the increase in employee related costs resulted from an increase in general and administrative related headcount  particularly in the finance area to support an increase in transactional processing due to increased revenue 
employee headcount increased by to employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  the decrease in net allocated overhead reflects the general and administrative function s slower headcount growth rate relative to other functional areas 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased director and officer insurance costs of  and fees for professional services aggregating million 
professional services fees consisted of systems consulting  accounting fees for internal control documentation and testing as well as outsourced accounting fees  excluding sarbanes oxley external audit fees  and legal fees 
there were also additional costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance of million and an increase in employee related costs of million 
the increase in employee related costs resulted from an increase in general and administrative related headcount  particularly in the finance and information systems departments  and also included employment taxes resulting from the exercise of stock options 
litigation reserves during the year ended december   we recorded an allowance of  for the estimated costs of settlement for the zilberman v 
netgear lawsuit 
for a detailed discussion of our pending litigation matters  please see item legal proceedings under part i of this report 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses  and  in general and administrative expenses 
this compared to  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses and  in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  and  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses and  in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r in the first quarter of will result in the remaining deferred stock based compensation balance of  as of december  being eliminated

table of contents interest income  interest expense and other expense year ended december  in thousands interest income  interest expense and other expense interest income interest expense other expense total interest income  interest expense and other expense interest income represents amounts earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest paid on loans 
other expense primarily represents gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and other miscellaneous expenses 
the aggregate of interest income  interest expense  and other expense amounted to net other income of million for the year ended december   compared to net other income of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to an additional million in interest income for the year ended december   from the investment of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance throughout the year 
this was offset in part by an increase in other expense of million consisting primarily of realized and unrealized losses associated with foreign currency denominated transactions due in part to currency volatility during the year as well as our billing in foreign currencies which began in the first quarter of the aggregate of interest income  interest expense  and other expense amounted to net other income of million for the year ended december   compared to net expense of  for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to a decrease of  in imputed interest expense associated with the nortel networks note  following the repayment of the note in august  as well as an additional million in interest income for the year ended december   from the investment of our cash balance throughout the year 
this was offset in part by an increase in other expense of  consisting primarily of realized and unrealized losses associated with foreign currency denominated transactions 
extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay debt that had a carrying value of million 
the repayment of debt resulted in the recognition of an extinguishment of debt charge of million in the third quarter of there was no such charge taken in the year ended december  or december  provision for benefit from income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  to a provision of million for the year ended december   from a provision of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by tax credits 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to non deductible stock based compensation  state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by a million tax benefit from exercises of stock options and tax credits 
provision for income taxes increased million  to a provision of million for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to non deductible stock based compensation  state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by a million tax benefit from exercises of stock options and tax credits 
the effective tax rate was for the 
table of contents year ended december  the principal reason for the income tax benefit in this period was the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million offset by provisions on taxable income including state taxes 
the million charge recorded in for extinguishment of debt was non deductible for tax purposes 
net income net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in gross profit of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased from million as of december  to million as of december  our short term investments  which represent the investment of funds available for current operations  increased from million as of december  to million as of december  operating activities during the year ended december  generated cash of million primarily due to an increase in net income 
investing activities during the year ended december  used million primarily for the net purchase of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment amounting to million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million  primarily resulting from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
our days sales outstanding increased from days as of december  to days as of december  our accounts payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease of million is due to the timing of purchases and the company s decision to take advantage of favorable discounts upon prompt payment 
inventory decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  in the quarter ended december  we experienced inventory turns of approximately  up from approximately turns in the quarter ended december  based on our current plans and market conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the forseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill 
table of contents the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle non cancelable lease and purchase commitments as of december  less than year years years total in thousands operating leases purchase obligations we lease office space  cars and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through february rent expense was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the terms of the facility lease provide for rental payments on a graduated scale 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period  and have accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
at december   we had million in non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
we generally have not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
in the second quarter of we began to invoice some of our international customers in foreign currencies including but not limited to  the euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the australian dollar 
as the customers that are currently invoiced in local currency become a larger percentage of our business  or to the extent we begin to bill additional customers in foreign currencies  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
for those customers in our international markets that we continue to sell to in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our 
table of contents products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and negatively impact our operating results 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 
as of december   we had net receivables in various local currencies 
a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates would result in an after tax positive or negative impact of million to net income at december
