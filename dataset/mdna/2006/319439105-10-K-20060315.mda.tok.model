financial initiatives management undertook several financial initiatives during the fiscal year 
the balance sheet repositioning was the most significant 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation executed a series of initiatives to reposition and deleverage its balance sheet designed to improve the financial well being of the corporation 
the corporation expects that these initiatives will improve the net interest margin and enhance its interest rate risk and liquidity risk profiles 
in addition  these initiatives are expected to be accretive to earnings and thus improve the corporation s earnings quality and capital ratios 
as a result of executing these initiatives  the corporation realized an approximate million pre tax million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of the repositioning included the following actions the corporation sold approximately million in fixed rate investment securities with an average book yield of percent and an average life of years 
this resulted in a pre tax loss on the sale of securities of approximately million million after tax 
the corporation extinguished million of its fhlb advances and related interest rate swaps with an average effective cost of month libor plus basis points  or percent at the time of extinguishment 
the remaining average life of the debt and swaps was approximately years and maturities ranged from june to march the corporation incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately million pre tax million after tax to extinguish these fhlb advances and incurred a loss of approximately million pre tax million after tax on the extinguishment of the related interest rate swaps 
the corporation extinguished million in fhlb advances with a fixed rate of percent and a final maturity of june the corporation incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately million pre tax million after tax to extinguish this debt 
the corporation used the remaining surplus cash proceeds  together with the proceeds of the trust securities sold by first charter capital trust ii  or approximately million  to repay fhlb overnight borrowings 
the corporation did not incur a prepayment penalty related to this payment 
these initiatives were executed during late october due to the relatively favorable interest rate environment and the increased risks that interest rates would rise 
first charter reduced the size of its investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets from percent at the end of september to approximately percent at december  first charter has also reduced its reliance on wholesale borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities from percent at the end of september to approximately percent at december  separately  the corporation issued million and million in floating rate  trust preferred securities the trust securities through specially formed subsidiary trusts in the second quarter first charter capital trust i and third quarter first charter capital trust ii of  respectively  to ensure that it has sufficient capital and liquidity to support anticipated future growth 
market expansion raleigh  nc during  first charter implemented a growth strategy intended to both expand the first charter footprint into high growth markets and optimize existing locations through attracting new customers and retaining existing customers 
as part of the strategic growth strategy  first charter has expanded operations into the raleigh  nc metro area 
the raleigh metro area is expected to have at or above average household income and growth rates relative to the north carolina and national averages 
first charter opened a loan production office in raleigh in the first quarter of which was later consolidated into its first financial center in raleigh on october  the financial center offers a full suite of banking services to individuals and small businesses  commercial lending  mortgages  and brokerage services 
this office also serves as the regional headquarters 
first charter also operates atms in the raleigh market 
the corporation expanded its presence in the raleigh area by opening additional full service financial centers and atms in the first quarter of existing markets first charter opened new replacement financial centers in monroe  concord  and charlotte nc during  providing an even greater level of service and convenience for customers in those markets 
first charter also added a new financial center in charlotte on october   bringing the total number of financial centers to at december  the community banking model in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers  first charter adopted a community banking model focused on delivering our clients with a broad array of financial products and solutions  delivered with exceptional service and convenience at a fair price 
it emphasizes local market decision making and management whenever possible 
management believes this model works well against both it s larger competitors that may have less flexibility  as well as local competition that may not have the array of products and services that first charter can offer 
first charter competes against three of the largest banks in the country as well as other local banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions and finance companies 
management believes that by focusing on core values  striving to expand our clients expectations  being an employer of choice and providing exceptional value to shareholders  first charter can achieve the profitability and growth goals it has set for itself 
financial summary net income amounted to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   a decrease from net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  as previously reported  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation incurred an approximate million after tax charge resulting from a series of balance sheet initiatives  which included the sale of securities and the extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swaps 
the return on average assets and return on common shareholders equity was percent and percent in  respectively  compared to percent and percent in  respectively 
earnings analysis for fourth quarter net income loss amounted to million  or per diluted share  for the three months ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for the same period in net income for the three months ended december  was impacted by the previously discussed balance sheet repositioning 
net interest income increased million to million  or million on a taxable equivalent basis  compared to the fourth quarter of the net interest margin increased basis points to percent compared to the fourth quarter of the expansion of the margin was primarily the result of the balance sheet repositioning  an increase in loan yield and an increase in the percentage of earning assets funded by low cost core deposits money market  demand and savings accounts 
noninterest income totaled  compared to million for the fourth quarter of included in the totals were securities gains losses of million for the fourth quarter of resulting from the balance sheet repositioning compared to securities gains of million for the fourth quarter of excluding securities gains and losses  noninterest income increased million  or percent  to million 
increases in deposit  atm  debit card  mortgage  and financial management revenues were key contributors to the growth 
in addition  property sale gains were million in the fourth quarter of compared to no gains in the fourth quarter of noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of totaled million and included a million charge to terminate derivative transactions and a million charge due to the early extinguishment of debt  both of which related to the balance sheet repositioning 
excluding these charges  noninterest expense was million 
this compares to fourth quarter noninterest expense of million 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and employee benefits related to additional personnel  increased commission based compensation and higher medical costs 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in occupancy and equipment expense due to a million fixed asset correction as part of a fixed asset inventory conducted during an income tax benefit of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of compared to an income tax expense of million for the fourth quarter of the income tax benefit for the fourth quarter was due to a decrease in the estimated effective tax rate resulting from the charge related to the previously mentioned balance sheet repositioning

critical accounting estimates and policies the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note one of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of the corporation s accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying the complex accounting principles to complicated transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental estimates and complex accounting principles 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of estimating values of assets or liabilities 
where alternatives exist  the corporation has used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs for the valuation 
actual performance that differs from the corporation s estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
allowance for loan losses the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies  as it requires some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the corporation believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect its careful evaluation of credit risk considering all information available to us 
the determination of the level of the allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon various judgments and assumptions  including i general economic conditions  ii loan portfolio composition  iii prior loan loss experience  iv management s evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of loans and v observations derived from the corporation s ongoing internal credit review and examination processes and those of its regulators 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation employs a variety of statistical modeling and estimation tools in developing the appropriate allowance 
the following provides a description of each of the components involved in the allowance for loan losses  the techniques the corporation used and the estimates and judgments inherent to each component 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation allowance for impaired loans  is computed based on documented reviews performed by the corporation s credit risk management 
the reviews are completed for impaired commercial relationships greater than  credit risk management typically estimates these valuation allowances by considering the fair value of the underlying collateral for each impaired loan using current appraisals 
the results of these estimates are updated quarterly or periodically as circumstances change 
changes in the dollar amount of impaired loans or in the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral can impact the valuation allowance on impaired loans and  therefore  the overall allowance for loan losses 
the second component of the allowance for loan losses  the portion attributable to all other loans without specific reserve amounts  is determined by applying loss rates to the outstanding balance of loans 
the portfolio is segmented into two major categories commercial loans and consumer loans 
commercial loans are segmented further by risk grade and type  so that separate loss factors are applied to each pool of commercial loans 
the loss factors applied to the commercial segments are determined using a migration analysis tool that computes current loss estimates by credit grade using a month trailing loss history database 
since the migration analysis is based on trailing data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
changes in commercial loan credit grades or in the mix of the portfolio can also impact this component of the allowance for loan losses from period to period 
consumer loans which include mortgage  general consumer  consumer real estate  home equity and consumer unsecured loans are segmented by loan type and by collateral grouping in order to apply separate loss factors to each pool of consumer loans 
the loss factors applied to the consumer segments are a thirty six month rolling average of losses 
since the loss factors are based on historical data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is intended to capture the various risk elements of the loan portfolio which may not be sufficiently captured in the historical loss rates 
these factors currently include intrinsic risk  operational risk  concentration risk and model risk 
intrinsic risk relates to the impact of current economic conditions on the corporation s borrower base  the effects of which may not be realized by the corporation in the form of charge offs for several periods 
the corporation monitors and documents various local  regional and national economic data  and makes subjective estimates of the impact of changes in economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses 
operational risk includes factors such as the likelihood of loss on a loan due to procedural error 
historically  the corporation has made additional loss estimates for certain types of loans that were either acquired from other institutions in mergers or were underwritten using policies that are no longer in effect at the corporation 
these identified loans are considered to have higher risk of loss than currently reflected in historical loss rates of the corporation  so additional estimates of loss are made by management 
concentration risk includes the risk of loss due to extensions of credit to a particular industry  loan type or borrower that may be troubled 
model risk reflects the inherent uncertainty of estimates within the allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation monitors its portfolio for any excessive concentrations of loans during each period  and if any excessive concentrations are noted  additional estimates of loss would be made 
changes in the allowance for loan losses for these subjective factors can arise from changes in the balance and types of outstanding loans  as well as changes in the underlying conditions which drive a change in the percentage used 
as more fully discussed below  the corporation continually monitors the portfolio in an effort to identify any other factors which may have an impact on loss estimates within the portfolio 
all estimates of the loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions in general could change and therefore result in additional losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
if management had made different assumptions about probable loan losses  the corporation s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
income taxes calculating the corporation s income tax expense requires significant judgment and the use of estimates 
the corporation periodically assesses its tax positions based on current tax developments  including enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
in analyzing the corporation s overall tax position consideration is given to the amount and timing of recognizing income tax liabilities and benefits 
in applying the tax and accounting guidance to the facts and circumstances income tax balances are adjusted appropriately through the income tax provision 
derivative instruments as of december   the corporation had no stand alone derivative instruments outstanding 
the corporation  however  may enter into interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to achieve the corporation s targeted interest rate profile 
interest rate swap agreements provide an exchange of interest payments computed on notional amounts that will offset any undesirable change in fair value resulting from market rate changes on designated hedged items 
a swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts  assets and or indices 
the interest rate swap agreements utilized by the corporation in the past qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is valued on a quarterly basis by a third party and an internal valuation model 
the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow model  the implied forward interest rate curve and a volatility index 
the corporation performs a quarterly assessment based on the third party valuations to assess whether the derivative used in its hedging transaction has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
the effectiveness assessment is conducted using the cumulative dollar offset method 
according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 if the change in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item is believed to be one hundred percent correlated at inception  the short cut method of accounting would apply  resulting in a presumption of no hedge ineffectiveness and no income statement impact 
for interest rate swaps that do not meet the criteria for the short cut accounting method  the corporation records on a quarterly basis  in noninterest income  the net change in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the designated hedged item  attributed to changes in interest rates  provided the criteria for hedge accounting continue to be met 
in the event the criteria for hedge accounting are not met in a future period  the corporation will cease recording the change in fair value of the hedged item and will amortize into earnings the then carrying value of the interest rate swap over the life of the hedged item 
the derivative hedging instruments were recorded at fair value in other assets or other liabilities 
the corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
this documentation includes analysis at inception and is ongoing relative to the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
if the corporation s initial judgments were inappropriate  hedge accounting would be reversed and only the change in fair value of the derivative would be recognized through the income statement 
the corporation will discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  and will reflect changes in fair value through the income statement 
earnings performance net interest income and margin net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
an analysis of the corporation s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and average balance sheets for the last three years is presented in table two 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis fte is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles performance measure used by management in operating the business which management believes provides investors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
the changes in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis from year to year are analyzed in table three 
the discussion below is based on net interest income computed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  an increase of approximately percent from net interest income of million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in average loan balances  an increase in the proportion of noninterest bearing deposits to the composition of funding sources and to a lesser extent the balance sheet repositioning which occurred in late october this was partially offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities relative to increases in asset yields 
the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
partially offsetting this increase was a basis point increase in earning asset yields compared to since the balance sheet repositioning occurred in late october  the benefit to the net interest margin for the year was minimal 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was impacted by a basis point increase in other borrowing costs and a basis point increase in deposit yields compared to interest bearing liability average balances increased million compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest bearing deposit average balances compared to  as retail certificates of deposit average balances increased million and wholesale deposit average balances increased million 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decline in other borrowing average balances  primarily wholesale borrowings 
earning asset yields were impacted by a basis point increase in loan yields and a basis point decrease in security yields compared to interest earning asset average balances increased million to billion at december  compared to billion for the same period 
these increases were primarily due to growth in the corporation s average loan balances  which increased million  compared to december  loan balances increased  in part  due to the purchase of whole loan adjustable rate mortgage arm loans during the first quarter of  which contributed million to average loans and loans held for sale 
this purchase was executed under a previously disclosed strategy in which the sale of investment securities and portfolio cash flows would fund the arm loan purchases 
these arm loans have similar average lives and a higher yield than the securities sold 
the arm loan purchase and the balance sheet repositioning contributed to a million reduction in the average balance of the securities portfolio  compared to december  the corporation s primary interest rate risk management objective is to maximize net interest income across a broad range of interest rate scenarios  subject to risk tolerance limits set by management and the board of directors 
as previously discussed  the corporation repositioned its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of the corporation expects the repositioning of the balance sheet to improve net interest income and the net interest margin and reduce interest rate risk 
the following table includes interest income on interest earning assets and related average yields  as well as interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and related average rates paid

noninterest income the major components of noninterest income are derived from service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage  brokerage  insurance and financial management 
in addition  the corporation realizes securities gains and losses  gains and losses from transactions involving bank owned property and income from its boli policies 
noninterest income decreased million  or percent  to million compared to the same period in included in noninterest income are several transactions listed in the table below 
table four schedule of selected items included in noninterest income years ended december dollars in thousands loss gain on sale of securities gain on sale of deposits and loans bank owned life insurance payment gain on sale of property deposit service charges increased million in part due to checking account growth and increases in transaction volume

mortgage services income grew million compared to as the corporation decided to sell a greater portion of its mortgage loan production in insurance services revenue increased million due  in part  to a purchased insurance agency in the fourth quarter of the corporation incurred approximately million in losses in its venture capital portfolio in  similar to the losses incurred in additional noninterest income items included securities losses of million recognized during resulting from the balance sheet repositioning compared to gains of million in and a million gain was recognized on the sale of one financial center s deposits and loans during no similar sale was recognized during in addition  boli revenues were impacted by a gain recognized as a result of a payment on claims of million recognized in the second quarter of compared to no claims received during property sale gains of million were recognized during from the sale of a branch facility and a sale leaseback transaction involving a bank financial center

noninterest expense noninterest expense is primarily comprised of operating expenses for the corporation 
the major components are salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  professional fees  charges related to the balance sheet repositioning and other operating expenses 
noninterest expense for totaled million compared to million for the year over year comparison of noninterest expense was impacted by several transactions listed in the table below 
table five schedule of selected items included in noninterest expense years ended december dollars in thousands employee benefit plan modification separation agreement fixed asset correction debt extinguishment expense derivative termination costs salaries and employee benefits increased due to additional costs associated with additional personnel  extended service hours  increased commission based compensation and higher medical costs 
part of the increase in medical costs was related to an acceleration of health insurance claims from the corporation s third party benefits administrator in connection with the transition to a new administrator in data processing expenses increased million due to increased debit card and software maintenance expenses 
occupancy and equipment expenses  excluding the fixed asset correction discussed below  increased million due to additional financial center lease and depreciation expenses 
marketing expense increased million due to back state sales and use taxes primarily related to direct mail and consulting services over the past three years 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees primarily due to lower accounting  attorney and other consulting fees 
additional noninterest expense items included a million charge to terminate derivative transactions in  a million charge due to the early extinguishment of debt in  million expense associated with a legacy employee benefit plan in and a million expense associated with the former cfo s retirement in in addition  the corporation recorded a million reduction in occupancy and equipment due to a correction related to the corporation s fixed asset records 
this adjustment was made after the corporation conducted a fixed asset inventory in the efficiency ratio decreased to percent for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  the calculation of the efficiency ratio excludes the impact of securities sales in both years and the charges related to the balance sheet repositioning in income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  amounted to million for an effective tax rate of percent  compared to million for an effective tax rate of percent for the year ended december  the decrease in the income tax expense and the effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to the decrease in income relative to nontaxable adjustments

balance sheet analysis securities available for sale the securities portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  is a component of the corporation s asset liability management alm strategy 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in the bank s risk tolerance  the composition of the rest of the balance sheet  and other factors 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity unless the unrealized losses are considered other than temporary 
the fair value of the securities portfolio is determined by various third party sources 
the valuation is determined as of a date within close proximity to the end of the reporting period based on available quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar securities if a quoted market price is not available 
at december   securities available for sale were million or percent of total earning assets  compared to billion or percent of total earnings assets at december  the reduction was primarily due to the previously discussed balance sheet repositioning which included the sale of million in fixed rate securities and the sale of securities to fund the arm loan purchase 
portfolio balances were also impacted by an increase in the pre tax unrealized net losses in the portfolio due to a rise in short and intermediate term interest rates 
pre tax unrealized net losses on securities available for sale were million at december  compared to pre tax unrealized net losses of million at december  the unrealized net losses in the securities available for sale portfolio could continue to increase with a rise in interest rates 
to mitigate against the risk of rising interest rates  the corporation s investment strategy focuses on shorter duration securities with more predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
this will allow the corporation to reinvest the cash flows of the portfolio into higher rate securities or fund loan growth in a rising interest rate environment 
the weighted average duration of the portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  the following table shows the carrying value of i us government obligations  ii us government agency obligations  iii mortgage backed securities  iv state and municipal obligations  v equity securities  which are primarily comprised of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock  and vi other securities 
table seven investment portfolio december  dollars in thousands securities available for sale us government obligations us government agency obligations mortgage backed securities state  county  and municipal obligations equity securities other total loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december  consisted of six major categories commercial non real estate  commercial real estate  construction  mortgage  consumer  and home equity 
pricing is driven by quality  loan size  loan tenor  prepayment risk  the corporation s relationship with the customer  competition and other factors 
the corporation is primarily a secured lender in all of these loan categories 
the terms of the corporation s loans are generally five years or less with the exception of home equity lines and residential mortgages  for which the terms can range out to years 
in addition  the corporation has a program in which it buys and sells portions of loans primarily originated in the southeastern region of the united states  both participations and syndications  from key strategic partner financial institutions with which the corporation has established relationships 
this portfolio includes commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans 
this program enables the corporation to diversify both its geographic and its total exposure risk 
commercial non real estate the corporation s commercial non real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with annual sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
commercial lending includes commercial  financial  agricultural and industrial loans 
pricing on commercial non real estate loans is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  the london interbank offer rate libor  the us dollar interest rate swap curve or rates on us treasury securities 
from time to time  the corporation sources commercial non real estate loans through a correspondent relationship 
commercial real estate similar to commercial non real estate lending  the corporation s commercial real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with annual sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
the real estate loans are both owner occupied and project related 
from time to time  the corporation sources commercial real estate loans through a correspondent relationship 
construction real estate construction loans include both commercial and residential construction  together with construction permanent loans  which are intended to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction project 
loans for commercial construction are usually to in market developers  builders  businesses  individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial structures primarily in the corporation s market area 
loans are made for purposes including  but not limited to  the construction of industrial facilities  apartments  shopping centers  office buildings  homes and warehouses 
the properties may be constructed for sale  lease or owner occupancy 
mortgage the corporation originates family residential mortgage loans throughout its footprint and through a loan origination office in reston  virginia 
from time to time  the corporation has purchased arm loans in other market areas through a correspondent relationship 
at december   loans purchased through this relationship represented million or percent of the total mortgage loan portfolio 
the majority of the purchased loans consist of interest only arms which reprice in or years 
no mortgage loans have been purchased since the first quarter of the corporation offers a full line of products  including conventional  conforming  and jumbo fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages which are originated and securitized or sold into the secondary market  however  from time to time a portion of this production is retained and then serviced through a third party arrangement 
consumer the corporation offers a wide variety of consumer loan products 
various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing customers and to other creditworthy candidates in the corporation s market area 
unsecured loans  including revolving credits eg checking account overdraft protection and personal lines of credit are provided and various installment loan products such as vehicle and marine loans are also offered 
home equity home equity loans and lines are secured by first and second liens on the borrower s residential real estate 
as with all consumer lending  home equity loans are centrally decisioned and documented to ensure the underwriting conforms to the corporate lending policy 
gross loans increased million  or percent  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the growth in loans was primarily due to i a million increase in mortgage loans  of which million was attributable to the purchase of arm loans during the first quarter of  ii a million increase in construction loans  iii a million increase in consumer loans partly due to the raleigh market expansion  iv a million increase in commercial non real estate loans  v a million increase in home equity loans and vi a million increase in commercial real estate loans 
the mix of variable rate  adjustable rate and fixed rate loans is incorporated into the corporation s alm strategy 
as of december   of the billion loan portfolio  approximately billion were tied to variable interest rates  approximately billion were fixed rate loans with scheduled maturities and billion were arms with an initial fixed rate period after which the loan rate floats on a predetermined schedule 
the table below summarizes loans in the classifications indicated 
table eight loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total loans less allowance for loan losses unearned income loans  net deposits total deposits increased million  or percent  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the growth in deposits was primarily focused in lower cost core deposits 
period end core deposits increased million  or percent  noninterest bearing deposits contributed to million of this growth 
certificates of deposit cds also grew million  with an million increase in wholesale cds and a million decrease in retail cds 
the increase in wholesale cds is a part of the corporation s strategy to diversify its wholesale funding sources 
the decrease in retail cds is due to a conscious effort to refrain from aggressively pricing a large concentration of ten month cds that had been gathered with premium pricing in the fall of other borrowings other borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  commercial paper and other short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
federal funds purchased represent unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions by the bank 
at december   the bank had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million with million outstanding compared to million in oustandings at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent short term borrowings by the bank with maturities less than one year collateralized by a portion of the corporation s united states government or agency securities 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million at december  compared to million at december  these borrowings are an important source of funding to the corporation 
access to alternate short term funding sources allows the corporation to meet funding needs without relying on increasing deposits on a short term basis 
first charter corporation issues commercial paper as another source of short term funding 
it is purchased primarily by the bank s commercial clients 
commercial paper outstanding at december  was million compared to million at december  other short term borrowings consists of the fhlb borrowings with an original maturity of one year or less 
fhlb borrowings are collateralized by securities from the corporation s investment portfolio  and a blanket lien on certain qualifying commercial and single family loans held in the corporation s loan portfolio 
at december   the bank had million of short term fhlb borrowings compared to million at december  in addition  the corporation has a million bank credit line that was not drawn upon at december  this compares to million drawn against the line at december  as part of the balance sheet repositioning the corporation extinguished million of short term debt  primarily with the fhlb  which had an average floating rate of fed funds plus basis points  or approximately percent at the time of prepayment 
long term borrowings represent fhlb borrowings with original maturities greater than one year and subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities 
at december   the bank had million of long term fhlb borrowings compared to million at december  in addition  the corporation had million of subordinated debentures at december  the corporation formed first charter capital trust i and first charter capital trust ii the trusts  in june and september  respectively  both are wholly owned business trusts 
first charter capital trust i and first charter capital trust ii issued million and million  respectively  of trust securities that were sold to third parties 
the proceeds of the sale of the trust securities were used to purchase subordinated debentures from the corporation  which are presented as long term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet and qualify for inclusion in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  subject to certain limitations 
the following is a schedule of other borrowings which consists of the following categories securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings

in addition  all mortgage  consumer and home equity loans are centrally decisioned 
all loans flow through an independent closing unit to ensure proper documentation 
finally  all known collection or problem loans are centrally managed by experienced workout personnel 
to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures  management maintains a set of asset quality standards for past due  nonaccrual and watch list loans and monitors the trends of these standards over time 
these standards are approved by the board of directors and reviewed quarterly with the board of directors for compliance 
loan administration and underwriting the bank s chief risk officer is responsible for the continuous assessment of the bank s risk profile as well as making any necessary adjustments to policies and procedures 
commercial loan relationships less than thousand may be approved by experienced commercial loan officers  within their loan authority 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are approved by signature authority requiring at least two experienced officers for relationships greater than thousand 
the exceptions to this include city executives senior loan officers who are authorized to approve relationships up to million 
an independent risk manager is involved in the approval of commercial and commercial real estate relationships that exceed million 
all relationships greater than million receive a comprehensive annual review by either the senior credit analysts or lending officers of the bank  which is then reviewed by the independent risk managers and or the final approval officer with the appropriate signature authority 
commitments over million are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief risk officer and the credit risk management committee comprised of executive and senior management 
in addition  commitments over million are reviewed by the board of directors loan committee 
these oversight committees provide policy  process  product and specific relationship direction to the lending personnel 
as of december   the corporation had a legal lending limit of million and a general target lending limit of million per relationship 
at times  some loan relationships may exceed the general target lending limit 
as of december   the corporation had relationships with exposure greater than the million lending limit compared to relationships at december  at december  and  the total loan balance of these relationships was million and million  respectively  all of which were current  with unfunded commitments totaling million and million  respectively 
the corporation s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the corporation s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the corporation s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the corporation s credit policies and procedures 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the corporation s entire primary market area  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the corporation s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decisioning process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
at december   the substantial majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within the charlotte metro region 
the diversity of the charlotte metro region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment  however  an economic downturn in the corporation s primary market area could adversely affect its business 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
additionally  the corporation s loan portfolio consists of certain non traditional loan products 
some of these products include interest only loans  loans with initial interest rates that are below the market interest rate for the initial period of the loan term and may increase when that period ends and loans with a high loan to value ratio 
based on the corporation s assessment  these products do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
derivatives credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost should the counter parties with contracts in a gain position to the corporation fail to perform under the terms of those contracts after considering recoveries of underlying collateral and netting agreements 
in managing derivative credit risk  both the current exposure  which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date  as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered 
to minimize credit risk  the corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements  which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter party upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  the corporation reduces risk by obtaining collateral based on individual assessments of the counter parties to these agreements 
the determination of the need for and levels of collateral will vary depending on the credit risk rating of the counter party 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk for further details regarding interest rate swap agreements 
as previously discussed  the corporation repositioned its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of as a result  the corporation extinguished million in debt and related interest rate swaps in october of as of december   the corporation had no stand alone derivative instruments outstanding 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonaccrual status is determined after a loan is days past due or when deemed not collectible in full as to principal or interest  unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo represents real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof and is generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor  as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
if such collectibility is not probable  the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when management determines  based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral together with the borrower s payment record and financial condition  that the borrower has the ability and intent to meet the contractual obligations of the loan agreement 
as of december   no loans were days or more past due and still accruing interest 
the table below summarizes the corporation s nonperforming assets and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest as of the dates indicated

approximately million of the original loan balance was charged off and million in previously accrued interest income was reversed and applied against principal 
of the remaining million balance  million was paid down in january nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned increased to percent at december  compared to percent at december  interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans for the years ended december    and  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
interest income on all such loans included in the results of operations for  and amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  were not concentrated in any one industry and primarily consisted of loans secured by real estate 
nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans may increase as economic conditions change 
management has taken current economic conditions into consideration when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses for a more detailed discussion 
allowance for loan losses the corporation s allowance for loan losses consists of three components i valuation allowances computed on impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 ii valuation allowances determined by applying historical loss rates to those loans not specifically identified as impaired  and iii valuation allowances for factors which management believes are not reflected in the historical loss rates or that otherwise need to be considered when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
these three components are estimated quarterly by credit risk management and  along with a narrative analysis  comprise the corporation s allowance for loan losses model 
the resulting components are used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
all estimates of loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to risk in the real estate market and changes in the economic conditions in its primary market area 
changes in these areas can increase or decrease the provision for loan losses 
during  the corporation made no changes to its estimated loss percentages for economic factors 
as a part of its quarterly assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the corporation reviews key local  regional and national economic information and assesses its impact on the allowance for loan losses 
based on its review for the year ended december   the corporation noted that economic conditions are mixed  however  management concluded that the impact on borrowers and local industries in the corporation s primary market area did not change significantly during the period 
accordingly  the corporation did not modify its loss estimate percentage attributable to economic factors in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation continuously reviews its portfolio for any concentrations of loans to any one borrower or industry 
to analyze its concentrations  the corporation prepares various reports showing total loans to borrowers by industry  as well as reports showing total loans to one borrower 
at the present time  the corporation does not believe it is overly concentrated in any industry or specific borrower and therefore has made no allocations of allowances for loan losses for this factor for any of the periods presented 
the corporation also monitors the amount of operational risk that exists in the portfolio 
this would include the front end underwriting  documentation and closing processes associated with the lending decision 
the percent of additional allocation for the operational reserve was increased during the second quarter of for loans originated using key referral sources  new commercial lenders  and finally the additional collateral risk associated with competitive market forces which are forcing the industry to increase the acceptable loan to value ratios for certain consumer based loans secured by real estate 
the corporation believes these additional risks are adequately provided for in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation continuously assesses its loan loss allocation methodology and model 
in the second quarter of  the corporation changed two variables in its model 
the corporation now looks at the loss history of consumer loans over a month history  compared to a month history previously 
in addition  the corporation looks at the loss history of commercial loans over a month history  compared to a month history previously 
these changes were made to more accurately reflect the life cycle of the consumer and commercial loan portfolios 
the corporation expects to continue to review and improve its allowance for loan losses allocation methodology in the future 
the table below presents i the allowance for loan losses at the beginning of the year  ii loans charged off and recovered iii loan charge offs  net  iv the provision for loan losses  v the allowance for loan losses  vi the average amount of net loans outstanding  vii the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and viii the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to gross loans

percent of gross loans at december  compared to million or percent of gross loans at december  the lower allowance for loan loss ratio is related to the corporation s improved credit quality trends  the removal of the previously discussed commercial loan loss allowance see nonperforming assets and increased proportion of lower risk mortgage and home equity loans in the loan portfolio 
this type of secured lending generally carries lower credit risk and thus requires lower allocations in the corporation s allowance model 
the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans 
table twelve allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage consumer home equity total the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was also impacted by changes in the allocation of loan losses to various loan types 
the total commercial loan allocation of allowance for loan losses decreased approximately million during primarily attributable to improved asset quality trends  which reduced the overall commercial allocation 
the allocation of allowance for loan losses for consumer loans increased approximately million during due to consumer loan growth 
the mortgage loan allocation of allowance for loan losses increased approximately million during this increase was primarily due to loan growth and potential risk characteristics of acquired arm loans in the first quarter of during the year ended december   the allocation associated with the inherent risk in modeling the allowance for loan losses increased million 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the corporation s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current and expected future economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to earnings which is necessary to maintain an adequate and appropriate allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the factors which influence changes in the allowance for loan losses have a direct effect on the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses changes from period to period as a result of a number of factors  the most significant of which for the corporation include the following i changes in the mix of types of loans  ii current charge offs and recoveries of loans  iii changes in impaired loan valuation allowances  iv changes in credit grades within the portfolio  which arise from a deterioration or an improvement in the performance of the borrower  v changes in loss percentages  and vi changes in the amounts of loans outstanding  which are used to estimate current probable loan losses 
in addition  the corporation considers other  more subjective factors which impact the credit quality of the portfolio as a whole and estimates allocations of allowance for loan losses for these factors  as well 
these factors include loan concentrations  economic conditions and operational risks 
changes in these components of the allowance can arise from fluctuations in the underlying percentages used as related loss estimates for these factors  as well as variations in the portfolio balances to which they are applied 
the net change in all of these components of the allowance for loan losses results in the provision for loan losses 
for a more detailed discussion of the corporation s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses  see allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million a year ago 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to the inherent risk associated with increased lending 
the provision for loan losses was also impacted by a million increase in net charge offs compared to net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million  or percent of average loans  compared to million  or percent of average loans for the same period 
the increase in charge offs was primarily due to a decrease in recoveries 
market risk management asset liability management and interest rate risk the corporation s primary interest rate risk management objective is to maximize net interest income across a broad range of interest rate scenarios  subject to risk tolerance approval by management and the board of directors 
management primarily analyzes interest rate risk in two fundamentally different ways earnings simulation and market value of equity 
the first method uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of near term earnings at risk net interest income at risk over a month horizon due to changes in interest rates 
in analyzing interest rate sensitivity for policy measurement  net interest income is simulated in plus and minus basis point rate shock scenarios relative to the implied forward interest rate scenario for the next months 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for near term earnings at risk is percent of net interest income 
at december   first charter estimated that its net interest income at risk to a plus and minus basis point rate shock relative to the implied forwards was a positive percent and negative percent  respectively 
the second method management uses to analyze interest rate risk is to calculate the market value of equity for the corporation 
this calculation discounts the anticipated cash flows of a static balance sheet using current rates 
management then recalculates the corporation s market value of equity in plus and minus basis point rate shock scenarios 
the corporations has recently established a percent limit for the market value of equity at risk for a basis point rate shock 
at december   the corporation s market value at risk for a basis point increase and decrease relative to the implied forward rate forecast was a negative percent and positive percent  respectively 
management also analyzes interest rate risk in parallel current and forward interest rate scenarios beyond the basis point rate shocks mentioned above 
in addition  management analyzes interest rate risk under various interest rate scenarios that involve changes in the relationship between various market rate indices 
management uses a variety of tools to manage first charter s interest rate risk including  but not limited to  loan and deposit pricing  its choice of tenor and repricing characteristics on its wholesale borrowings  its choice of the tenor and repricing characteristics of its investment portfolio  and from time to time  various derivative products 
during  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million 
as a result of the balance sheet repositioning in  the corporation terminated these interest rate swap agreements 
the corporation executed the balance sheet repositioning by also extinguishing million of debt  some of which were hedged by the aforementioned swaps  and a similar amount of long term  low yield investment securities 
the combination of these transactions was designed to move the corporation toward its targeted interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile 
table thirteen summarizes the expected maturities and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with certain of the corporation s significant non trading financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits are excluded from table thirteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
for further information on the fair value of financial instruments  see note nineteen of the consolidated financial statements

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
standby letters of credit are recorded as a liability by the corporation at the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised 
refer to note seventeen of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of commitments 
the corporation does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than as described in note one related to the trust securities 
the following table presents aggregated information about commitments of the corporation which could impact future periods 
table fifteen commitments as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period less than total amounts dollars in thousands year years years over years committed lines of credit standby letters of credit loan commitments total commitments liquidity risk liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows adequate to fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract retail deposits  by current earnings  and by a strong capital base that enables the corporation to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
management s asset liability policy includes optimizing net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
liquidity is managed at two levels 
the first is the liquidity of the corporation 
the second is the liquidity of the bank 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential  because each of the corporation and the bank have different funding needs and sources  and each are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements 
the primary source of funding for the corporation includes dividends received from the bank and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
in addition  the corporation had a million bank line of credit with no outstandings and commercial paper outstandings of million at december  primary uses of funds for the corporation include repayment of commercial paper  share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders 
during the second and third quarter of  the corporation issued trust securities through specially formed trusts 
the trust securities are presented as long term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet and are includable in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  subject to certain limitations 
primary sources of funding for the bank include customer deposits  wholesale deposits  other borrowings  loan repayments and securities available for sale 
the bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling billion with million outstanding 
at december   the bank also had million of federal funds lines with million outstanding 
primary uses of funds include repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio 
management believes the corporation s and the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs and deposit withdrawal requirements 
the corporation has existing contractual obligations that will require payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about such payments to be made in future periods

capital management the corporation views capital as its most valuable and most expensive funding source 
the objective of effective capital management is to generate above market returns on equity to the corporation s shareholders while maintaining adequate regulatory capital ratios 
some of the corporation s primary uses of capital include funding growth  asset acquisition  dividend payments and common stock repurchases 
shareholders equity at december  increased to million  representing percent of period end assets compared to million or percent of period end assets at december  the increase was due mainly to net income of million partially offset by cash dividends of per share  which resulted in cash dividend payments of million for year ended december  in addition  the after tax unrealized loss on securities available for sale increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was due to a rise in short and intermediate term interest rates 
on january   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the corporation s common stock 
as of december   the corporation had repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock at an average per share price of under this authorization  which has reduced shareholders equity by million 
no shares were repurchased under this authorization during the year ended december  on october   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of the corporation s common stock 
at december   no shares had been repurchased under this authorization 
the corporation anticipates repurchasing shares under one or both of these plans in under certain conditions 
the principal asset of the corporation is its investment in the bank 
thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the bank to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note twenty of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions 
the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the standards of the federal reserve board  the corporation must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity  trust preferred securities  minority interests and qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill and other adjustments 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in federal reserve standards 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve board 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note twenty of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these requirements 
at december   the corporation and the bank were in compliance with all existing capital requirements and were classified as well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
in the judgment of management  there have been no events or conditions since december  that would change the well capitalized status of the corporation or the bank 
it is management s intention for both the corporation and the bank to continue to be well capitalized for the foreseeable future 
the corporation s capital requirements are summarized in the table below table seventeen capital ratios risk based capital leverage capital tier capital total capital dollars in thousands amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage actual required excess percentage of total adjusted average assets
