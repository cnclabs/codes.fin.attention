item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s mission is to commercialize the use of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites used as the primary building material in everyday commercial products 
the company has developed and is implementing a strategy to manufacture and sell carbon fibers into commercial applications at costs competitive with other materials 
in addition  through its technical fibers segment the company is the leading supplier of carbon fibers to the aircraft brake industry  and manufactures and markets oxidized acrylic fibers  an intermediate product of the carbon fiber manufacturing process  for fire and heat resistance applications 
the company introduced its carbon fibers strategic plan in to develop a low cost process to produce carbon fibers and build significant capacity while encouraging growth of new applications 
as part of its strategy to establish availability of carbon fibers on a scale sufficient to encourage growth of large volume applications  the company completed a major carbon fiber production capacity expansion in fiscal at its abilene  texas facility 
while the company succeeded in developing its infrastructure to become the low cost producer  the large volume applications were slower to develop than anticipated 
from to mid total carbon fiber usage did not grow significantly and aerospace applications actually declined 
this situation resulted in substantial overcapacity and destructive pricing in the industry 
much of the new carbon fiber business was captured by the aerospace fibers as certain manufacturers sold their aerospace grade fibers on the commercial markets at prices that did not cover their total costs  undermining the company s commercialization strategy 
the carbon fiber market conditions began to change in fiscal two major aerospace programs  the airbus a and the boeing e  have absorbed virtually all of the aerospace fiber capacity  and resulted in the divergence of the aerospace and commercial markets for carbon fibers 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company announced long term supply arrangements with the two largest manufacturers of wind turbines 
the company expects that these supply arrangements will generate to million of sales over the next three years 
increasing sales of carbon fiber products during fiscal confirmed this shift 
the divergence of the two markets was accelerated by the strength in the development of the carbon fiber wind turbine blade market 
currently zoltek believes it is in a unique position of having installed capacity  the technical capability to increase the scale of its productive capacity with relatively short lead times and the fiber quality that can attract current available and future new business 
the recent increase in the demand for carbon fibers relates to several different applications  including aerospace 
during fiscal  the company experienced growth in customer demand in the carbon and technical fiber business units  as net sales of these segments increased million and million  respectively  over fiscal the company has specifically targeted three significant and emerging applications wind energy  oil and gas  and automotive 
development of the use of carbon fibers is continuing in each of these targeted market segments 
with the new orders in place and indications for additional significant orders  the company restarted its major carbon fiber manufacturing facility in abilene  texas which had been temporarily idled 
maintaining the excess capacity has been costly  but the company believes it has been necessary to assure customers of adequate supply and encourage them to shift to carbon fibers from other materials 
as of september   all five lines at the company s abilene facility were operational  however  they have not reached the targeted production rates 
the per line production has been improving and the company believes the lines should reach desired production rates during the second quarter of fiscal in october the company moved its prepreg operations from san diego to salt lake city 
the company plans to bring the capacity back on line during fiscal as carbon fiber becomes available to run the production lines 
until that time  the company will incur unused capacity cost related to this facility 
in order to meet demand for carbon fibers for wind energy and other commercial carbon fiber applications  zoltek undertook a three phase capacity expansion program 
first  in fiscal zoltek initiated the start up of the five installed lines at its abilene  texas facility and activated sufficient precursor capacity to support all of the company s carbon fiber capacity 
second  zoltek has added two new carbon fiber lines and added sufficient precursor capacity at the company s hungarian facility which are expected to begin operating at targeted production rates during the first quarter of the third phase of the expansion program calls for a doubling of the carbon fiber and precursor capacity levels after the second phase  expected to be operational december  the company expects that a million convertible debt financing package entered into in september  of which million has been funded to date  will provide a substantial portion of the capital resources for the planned capacity increase in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued the nylon fiber operation and the acrylic textile business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued the cmc operation 
these divisions were deemed not to be part of the long term strategy of the company and not expected to be profitable in the foreseeable future due to the continued pricing pressure from competitive manufacturers 
the wind down of nylon fiber and acrylic textile product lines was substantially completed by february   and the cmc operation was shut down at september  the company is utilizing a portion of the acrylic fiber capacity to supply precursor for its growing carbon fiber manufacturing operations 
the results from operations of these two divisions have been reclassified to discontinued operations for fiscal and results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  the company s sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as production and sales of wind energy orders continued and the demand for the company s milled and chopped products significantly increased from prior years 
technical fiber sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal technical fiber sales increased as the company had a significant increase in orders from aircraft brake customers 
sales of the continuing components of the specialty products business segment decreased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as the sales of the company s netlon division in hungary decreased due to pricing pressures from competitors 
the company s cost of sales including available unused capacity costs increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber cost of sales increased by  or million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in carbon fiber cost of sales reflected increased sales  as well as a significant amount of the cost of sales which management estimates were attributable to start up and post start up operating inefficiencies of the installed carbon fiber lines at its abilene  texas facility 
the difficulties were due in large part the inability to recruit and train qualified workers and managers at the plant that had been dormant for several years 
the company expects that the efficiency of the manufacturing operation will improve during the first and second quarter of fiscal technical fiber cost of sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in technical fiber cost of sales was a reflection of the increase in sales 
the cost of sales of the specialty products segment decreased million to million compared to fiscal as sales decreased million 
the reduced margin related to the increase in the cost of raw materials for the specialty products segment 
the company continued to incur costs related to the unused productive capacity for carbon fibers at the abilene  texas facility and prepreg operation 
these costs included depreciation and other overhead associated with the unused capacity 
these costs  which were separately identified on the statement of operations  were approximately million during fiscal and million in fiscal the company believes it has been necessary to maintain available capacity to encourage development of significant new large scale applications 
with the increased orders during fiscal  unused capacity costs continued to decrease significantly during the fiscal year and were substantially absorbed in ongoing operations by the end of fiscal see additional discussion of the abilene facility under liquidity and capital resources 
application and market development costs were million in fiscal and million in fiscal these costs included product and market development efforts  product trials and sales and product development personnel and related travel 
targeted emerging applications include automobile components  fire heat barrier and alternate energy technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase related to staffing of management positions that have been filled to meet the new demands of the growing sales and production volume and costs related to become compliant with the sarbanes oxley act s requirements 
operating loss was million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
carbon fiber operating loss increased from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal these losses also included approximately million of costs which management estimates were attributable to the start up and post start up operating inefficiencies of the installed carbon fiber lines at its abilene  texas facility 
the operating income in technical fibers increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as sales of technical fibers in our core aircraft brake business increased over fiscal specialty products operating income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as lower sales related to the company s netlon division were not offset by a decrease in cost 
corporate headquarters operating loss increased by million to a loss of million in fiscal due to staffing of management positions that have been filled to meet the new demands of the growing sales and production volume and costs related to become compliant with the sarbanes oxley act s requirements 
the increase in the company s total operating loss was principally a result of the inefficiencies of the abilene  texas facility and the effort to expand production of hungarian precursor lines 
interest expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in the corresponding period of fiscal the decrease in interest resulted from higher debt levels after the company s refinancing transactions offset by the capitalization of interest cost of million related to the expansion of the company s carbon fiber lines see liquidity and capital resources 
due to the limited variable rate debt  the impact of the increase in interest rates was immaterial 
amortization of financing fees which are non cash expenses  was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in amortization resulted from the company s issuing additional convertible debt which increased expenses by million  refinancing transactions as the company wrote off the unamortized portion of deferred financing expense of million and incurred a prepayment fee of million to pay off an existing mortgage note see liquidity and capital resources 
loss on value of warrants and conversion feature  which is a non cash item  increased million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal see liquidity financing 
the increase in the loss was attributable to the increase in the market price of the company s common stock during fiscal compared to fiscal and a larger balance of outstanding convertible notes and warrants 
other income expense  net  was a loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million for fiscal the increase in the foreign currency transactional loss during fiscal was due to the hungarian forint becoming much weaker during compared to the euro and pound in which the company buys most raw material 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for the corresponding period in the prior year 
a valuation allowance was recorded against the income tax benefit resulting from the pre tax loss in both fiscal and due to uncertainties in the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforward in the future 
the expense for fiscal related to local taxes for the hungarian facility 
the foregoing resulted in a loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported a loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for fiscal compares to a loss of million for fiscal the significant decrease in sales was offset by a significant decrease in cost during fiscal as the company sold off its prior existing inventory balance of its acrylic fiber business and slowed production of its cmc division as it shut down at year end fiscal the company reported a loss from discontinued operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  the company s sales increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to increases in carbon fiber sales and technical fiber sales 
carbon fiber sales increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in carbon fiber sales in fiscal was achieved despite a decrease of million from related to the company s decision to relocate its prepreg operations from california to utah to reduce costs by combining its operations with another of the company s facilities 
other carbon fibers sales increased by million in fiscal from fiscal as production and sales of sporting goods and wind energy orders continued during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the company experienced a strong increase in the overall demand for carbon fiber over prior years 
technical fiber sales excluding intersegment increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal technical fiber sales increased as demand improved not only in the aircraft brake customers but also for the flame retardant market 
sales of the specialty products business segment increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued the nylon fiber operation and the acrylic textile business 
the results from operations of these two divisions have been reclassified to discontinued operations for fiscal and the remaining specialty products division sales have remained flat from fiscal to  however  the divisions remained profitable at these levels 
the company s cost of sales including available unused capacity costs increased by  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon and technical fiber cost of sales increased by or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as sales of carbon and technical fiber increased for the year 
the increase of compared to an increase of in sales results from the company s ability to absorb its fixed cost as manufacturing activities increased 
the cost of sales of the company s specialty products business segment increased compared to the increase in sales  reflecting sales mix factors 
the company continued to incur costs related to the underutilized productive capacity for carbon fibers at the abilene  texas facility  including depreciation and other overhead associated with the unused capacity 
these costs  which were separately identified on the statement of operations  were approximately million during fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in was due to the start up of the carbon fiber lines in abilene during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company believes it has been necessary to maintain available capacity to encourage development of significant new large scale applications 
with the increased orders in fiscal  unused capacity costs are expected to continue to decrease significantly during that period and to be fully absorbed in ongoing operations by the end of fiscal as all installed production lines began operating 
see additional discussion of the abilene facility under liquidity and capital resources 
application and market development costs were million in fiscal and million in fiscal as the company continued cost containment measures implemented in related to personnel involved in research and development 
these costs included product and market development efforts  product trials and sales and product development personnel and related travel 
targeted emerging applications include automobile components  fire heat barrier and alternate energy technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal although sales for the year increased and carbon fiber sales increased the company has continued cost containment measures related to personnel in non operations departments implemented during fiscal operating loss from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
carbon fiber operating loss improved from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the operating income in technical fibers increased from income of million in fiscal to million in fiscal specialty product operating income increased from an income of million in fiscal to an income of million in fiscal corporate headquarters operating loss decreased with a loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the decrease in the company s total operating loss was a result of the significant improvement in the carbon fibers and technical fibers business units as sales and production have increased to absorb fixed manufacturing cost and the continued reduction of operating expenses due to the cost containment measures implemented during interest expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest resulted from higher debt levels after the company s refinancing transactions see liquidity and capital resources 
the company experienced little fluctuation attributed to changes in interest rates as a substantial portion of the debt portfolio consists of fixed rate 
amortization of debt discount from warrants  deferred financing and beneficial conversion feature costs  which are non cash expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in amortization resulted from the company s refinancing transactions see liquidity and capital resources 
loss on value of warrants and conversion feature  a non cash item  increased million from no expense in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal see liquidity financing 
the increase in the loss was attributable to an increase in our stock price during as the company had to mark to market the value of the warrants and conversion feature following the issuance of convertible debt instruments in january and march no such obligations existed in the prior year 
other income expense  net  was immaterial in fiscal and fiscal income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to an income tax expense of million for fiscal a valuation allowance was recorded against the income tax benefit resulting from the pre tax loss in both fiscal and due to uncertainties in the company s ability to utilize tax losses in the future and the expense related to local taxes for the hungarian facility 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported a net loss per share from continuing operations of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding were million for fiscal and million for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to discontinue and exit two divisions of its zoltek rt 
operations which manufacture acrylic and nylon fibers and yarns 
these divisions are not part of the long term strategy of the company and will not be profitable in the foreseeable future due to the continued pricing pressure from competitive manufacturers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment loss on discontinued operations of million compared to zero in the operating loss related to those divisions was million for the fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was due to sales decreasing by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal while cost of sales only decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as the company did not decrease its fixed cost component of cost of sales at a rate equal to the decline in sales 
the company also recorded a loss of million related to a legal judgment involving the company s former hardcore subsidiary 
the company is vigorously defending this matter and has filed counterclaims and an appeal 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources due to the timing of development of markets for carbon fiber products in each of the past few fiscal years  the company has incurred operating losses and the company s operations have used cash in excess of cash generated by operating activities 
as a result  the company has executed refinancing arrangements and incurred borrowings under credit facilities  multiple convertible debenture facilities  as well as long term debt financing utilizing the equity in the company s real estate properties  to maintain adequate liquidity to support the company s operating and capital activities 
management will seek to fund the company s near term operating needs from anticipated sales increases related to expected increases in production capacity at existing facilities  sale of excess inventories  and continued aggressive management of the company s working capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize such anticipated sales increases from improvements in its production capacity from its existing facilities  or that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund its various obligations in the ordinary course of business 
should the company be unable to generate sufficient cash flows  it may be required to seek additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available  or if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s ability to obtain additional debt and or equity financing will depend on numerous factors  including the company s operating performance both with respect to meeting planned production capacity as well as the existence of sufficient demand for the company s products and overall market conditions including potential third party investors and or lenders 
in september  zoltek entered into an agreement for a new convertible debenture financing package of up to million in a private placement with a group of institutional investors 
in order to match the cash needs to support the company s planned expansion  the financing agreement provides for the funding to occur in four separate closings of million  million  million and million  respectively  of which the first two tranches have been drawn down 
the agreement provides for zoltek to draw down the remaining financing over the next twelve months subject to the company registering the shares related to the prior draw downs 
in december  the company extended the expiration of its credit facility with the us bank to january  the extended credit facility consists of a term loan of million and a revolving credit loan with maximum available borrowings of million  of which million and million was available as of september and december   respectively 
the company anticipates it will require the remaining proceeds of the million financing package or other significant financing in fiscal to support its previously announced capacity expansion program 
the company believes this is sufficient to fund near term liquidity needs but there are no guarantees that changes in events and circumstances based on the factors described above could lead to the need for additional borrowings 
the company believes the financing package mentioned above of which million have been received along with the availability under the company s revolving credit facility is sufficient to fund zoltek s operations during warrant and conversion features in january  march and october of and february  the company issued convertible notes and warrants which would require the company to register the resale of the shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of these securities 
the company accounts for the fair value of these outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and conversion feature of its convertible notes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and eitf issue no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock  which requires the company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion feature and warrants as embedded derivatives contained in the company s convertible notes 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company bifurcated the fair value of the conversion feature from the convertible notes  since the conversion feature was determined to not be clearly and closely related to the debt host 
in addition  since the effective registration of the securities underlying the conversion feature and warrants is an event outside of the control of the company  pursuant to eitf issue no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the conversion feature and warrants as long term liabilities as it was assumed that the company would be required to net cash settle the underlying securities 
the company is required to carry these embedded derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value and unrealized changes in the values of these embedded derivatives are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on value of warrants and conversion feature

the convertible debentures issued at the first and second closings are convertible into zoltek common stock of  and  shares  respectively  which correlates to a conversion price of per share 
debentures issuable at the third and fourth closings will be convertible into zoltek common stock at a conversion price equal to the market price at the time of the applicable closing 
this issuance is collateralized by the existing carbon fiber assets of the company s hungarian subsidiary 
in the first two closings  the debentures were accompanied by five year warrants that give holders the right to purchase up to a total of  shares of zoltek common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in the third and fourth closings  the amount and number of attached warrants will vary according to zoltek s share price at the time of the closing 
as part of the new financing agreement  zoltek has reduced the conversion price on its outstanding convertible debt in the aggregate principal amount of million issued in october from to  with the requirement that conversion take place within days of the second closing 
further  zoltek also has agreed to reduce the conversion price on its outstanding convertible debt in the aggregate principal amount of million issued february based on the market price of zoltek s common stock on the nine month anniversary of the second closing 
the adjusted conversion price will equal of the market price of the common stock  but will not be less than nor exceed

the company executed a guaranty of hardcore composite s lease obligations of approximately  per month to the former owner 
the former owner s action claimed damages in the amount of million for breaches by the company of its obligations under the guaranty and the settlement agreement and  in addition  demanded million in damages from hardcore and the company  jointly and severally  under the terms of the settlement agreement 
in october  the court of common pleas for cuyahoga county  ohio ruled in favor of the former owner of hardcore composites in the amount of million 
in prior periods  the company has accrued million in respect of the possible liability in this matter  which it believes is its maximum obligation under this guaranty 
the company is vigorously defending this matter  has filed counterclaims and filed an appeal that represents its only recourse regarding this guaranty 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a further material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
to date  the company has not made any payments of any portion of this obligation  although it posted an appeal bond in the amount of million 
the lease of the hardcore composites manufacturing facility expires march  hardcore no longer occupies the facility and  accordingly  in connection with the ongoing litigation with the former owner  zoltek is asserting that zoltek has no further ongoing guarantee obligation with respect to the lease 
the company also is the obligee on aggregate original value of unsecured promissory notes of million in connection with the sale of hardcore  for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
management of the company concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate in light of hardcore s current financial condition which  among other relevant factors  make the collection of the promissory notes doubtful 
critical accounting policies outlined below are accounting policies that zoltek believes are key to a full understanding of the company s operations and financial results 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenue recognition sales transactions are initiated through customer purchase order or sales agreement which includes fixed pricing terms 
the company recognizes sales for manufactured products on the date title to the sold product transfers to the customer  which is either the shipping date or the date consumed by the customer if sold on consignment 
manufactured products are accepted prior to shipment and thus an allowance for returns is not accrued as historical returns have not been material 
the company reviews its accounts receivable on a monthly basis to identify any specific customers for collectibility issues 
if the company deems that an amount due from a customer is uncollectible  the amount is recorded as expense in the statement of operations 
during fiscal  and  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of sales were earned from one customer in the technical fiber segment 
inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
for several years prior to fiscal  carbon fiber sales were depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
these factors combined with the high level of inventories maintained by the company  resulted in the company reducing the cost of certain carbon fiber inventories to their lower estimated market values 
it is possible that the market value of these carbon fiber inventories may further decrease resulting in additional charges to cost of sales excluding available unused capacity costs 
application and development expenses the company is actively pursuing the development of a number of applications for the use of its carbon fiber and related products 
the company is currently party to several developmental agreements with various prospective users of these products for the purpose of accelerating the development of various carbon fiber applications 
additionally  the company is executing several internal developmental strategies to further the use of carbon fiber and consumer and industrial products made from carbon fiber 
as a result  the company incurs certain costs for research  development and engineering of products and manufacturing processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal application and development expenses are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
given the company s position and strategy within the carbon fiber industry  it is expected that similar or greater levels of application and development expenses could be incurred in future periods 
unused capacity costs prior to fiscal  the company was not operating its abilene  texas facility at full capacity 
as a result  the company has elected to categorize certain costs related to these idle assets as unused capacity costs 
such costs totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and include depreciation and other overhead expenses associated with unused capacity 
the unused capacity costs are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
as discussed above  the company has resumed certain levels of manufacturing at this facility during fiscal valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to a long lived asset or a group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
these judgments and assumptions are particularly challenging as they relate to the company s long lived assets due to the developmental stage and current market conditions of the carbon fiber industry 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
the company does not believe such risk is material because a significant amount of the company s current debt is at fixed rates 
however  the february convertible debt issuance of million bears interest at a variable rate and the company plans to address the risk issue 
at september   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
however  a one percent increase in the weighted average interest rate of the company s debt would result in a million increase in interest expense based on the debt levels at september  the company views as long term its investment in zoltek rt  which has a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company does not hedge this net investment 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  the company is exposed to zoltek rt 
s functional currency  which is the hungarian forint 
the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek rt 
translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates was million at september  and  respectively 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek rt 
resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the hungarian forint at september  and amounted to million 
in addition  as of september   the company has a long term loan with its zoltek rt 
subsidiary of million 
the company does not expect the loan to be repaid in the near future  in fact the company expects the loan to increase as the company continues to invest in the expansion of its carbon fiber operations at its hungarian facility 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
the company could have unrealized gains or losses on the loan as the value of the forint increases or decreases against the us dollar  which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustment of equity 
in addition  zoltek rt 
routinely sells its products to customers located primarily throughout europe in sales transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
also  zoltek rt 
has debt that is denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
as a result  zoltek rt 
is exposed to foreign currency risks related to these transactions 
the company does not currently employ a foreign currency hedging strategy related to the sales of zoltek rt 
in january  march and october of and february  the company issued convertible notes and warrants which would require the company to register the resale of the shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of these securities 
the company accounts for the fair value of these outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and conversion feature of its convertible notes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and eitf issue no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock  which requires the company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion feature and warrants as embedded derivatives contained in the company s convertible notes 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company bifurcated the fair value of the conversion feature from the convertible notes  since the conversion feature was determined to not be clearly and closely related to the debt host 
in addition  since the effective registration of the securities underlying the conversion feature and warrants is an event outside of the control of the company  pursuant to eitf issue no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the conversion feature and warrants as long term liabilities as it was assumed that the company would be required to net cash settle the underlying securities 
the company is required to carry these embedded derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value  which was million and million at september  and respectively 
any unrealized changes  which is an inverse relation to changes in the company s stock price  in the values of these embedded derivatives are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss on value of warrants and conversion feature 
since these gains and loss are non cash in nature the company does not expect to employ a type of hedging strategy related to these transactions
