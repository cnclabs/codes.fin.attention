general we operate primarily in two distinct business segments i ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling  and ii product manufacturing  fabricating  smelting and refining of lead and other metals lead fabrication and recycling 
the scrap metal recycling segment includes scrap metal recycling yards located in buffalo  rochester  and niagara falls  new york  and an aluminum de ox plant and a scrap handling company each located in lackawanna  new york 
the lead fabrication and recycling segment includes five lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california  carson city  nevada and granite city  illinois and a secondary lead smelting and refining plant located in tampa  florida 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual 
table of contents results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
environmental remediation costs the company is subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  and will incur additional capital and operating costs in the future to comply with currently existing laws and regulations  new regulatory requirements arising from recently enacted statutes  and possible new statutory enactments 
the company accrues losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recorded no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
determining a the extent of remedial actions that are or may be required  b the type of remedial actions to be used  c the allocation of costs among potentially responsible parties prps and d the costs of making such determinations  on a site by site basis  require a number of judgments and assumptions and are inherently difficult to estimate 
the company utilizes certain experienced employees responsible for site monitoring  third party environmental specialists  and correspondence and progress reports obtained from the various regulatory agencies responsible for site monitoring to estimate its accrued environmental remediation costs 
the company generally contracts with third parties to fulfill most of its obligations for remedial actions 
the time period necessary to remediate a particular site may extend several years  and the laws governing the remediation process and the technology available to complete the remedial action may change before the remedial action is complete 
additionally  the impact of inflation and productivity improvements can change the estimates of costs to be incurred 
it is reasonably possible that technological  regulatory or enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies  the nonexistence or inability of other prps to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities or other factors could necessitate the recording of additional liabilities which could be material 
the majority of the company s environmental remediation accrued liabilities are applicable to its lead fabrication and secondary lead smelting operating segment 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are impaired  the impairment is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future discounted cash flows 
assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill the company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests for impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
the company has elected to perform its annual analysis as of december of each fiscal year 
no indicators of impairment were identified for the years ended december   and revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 
the company s lead fabrication and recycling segment performs certain services under tolling arrangements and recognizes tolling revenue as services are performed 
tolling services are primarily provided by the secondary lead smelting and refining plant in tampa  fl whereby the plant receives a customer s junk batteries industrial  marine  golf cart  automobile  etc 
and will return refined lead alloyed to the customer s specifications 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled   and  at december    and  respectively 

table of contents trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the company generally does not charge interest on past due amounts or require collateral on trade receivables 
the loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
while we believe our allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate  changes in economic conditions or any weakness in the steel  metals  or construction industry could adversely impact our future earnings 
inventories our inventories consist of ferrous and non ferrous scrap metals and lead metals and lead products 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
quantities of inventories are determined based on our inventory systems and are subject to periodic physical verification using techniques including observation  weighing and estimates 
prices of commodities we own may be volatile 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals  which are at times volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories promptly and efficiently 
income taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company files its income tax return on a consolidated basis with its respective subsidiaries 
the members of the consolidated group have elected to allocate income taxes among the members of the group by the separate return method  under which the parent company credits the subsidiary for income tax reductions resulting from the subsidiary s inclusion in the consolidated return  or the parent company charges the subsidiary for its allocated share of the consolidated income tax liability 
results of operations the company is divided into two industry segments scrap metal recycling  which breaks down into two general product categories  ferrous and non ferrous metals  and lead fabrication and recycling  comprised of lead fabrication and recycling and lead smelting

december  september  june  march  december  the results of the scrap metal recycling segment operations depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the northeastern united states 
for example  increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability for the industry during the years through however  during the years and  the asian financial crisis severely curtailed demand and decreased prices  causing a negative impact on the results of our scrap metal recycling segment 
during the year  the company saw demand for recycled metal rise  but unusually large supplies of recycled ferrous metal became available from certain countries that were part of the former soviet union  thereby holding prices down 
in addition  domestic demand for finished steel products was strong  but lower cost imports  primarily from asia  caused average prices to generally decline 
in the year  the demand for recycled metals declined in the united states as domestic steel production declined  however  demand in asia  particularly in china  remained firm 
selling prices also continued to be adversely affected by supplies coming out of the former soviet union and during the first six months of the year  recycled metals prices approached record lows due primarily to this surplus coupled with weak domestic demand 
domestic demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing united states economy and competition from lower cost imports 
the result was a record low average net selling price for the ferrous manufacturing business during the year during the second half of the year  certain countries of the former soviet union started imposing export tariffs and bans on recycled ferrous metal 
as a result  recycled ferrous metal supplies to global markets declined causing prices to increase 
demand  which is being fueled primarily by asia  continued to remain strong and the company continues to experience improved market conditions 
throughout much of the remainder of the year  selling prices continued to rise primarily due to the tight supply of ferrous metal available in the export market and the weakness of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies 
ferrous recyclers saw higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes during and into due primarily to higher domestic and foreign demand for scrap 
the increased demand can be attributed to the broad based recovery of the us and foreign economies 
we believe that near record prices for many grades of ferrous scrap in resulted in an overall increase of available scrap 

table of contents as the chart above illustrates  saw fluctuating prices for our ferrous scrap 
demand for our scrap remained relatively consistent throughout the year however markets were affected by foreign buyers leaving the market for periods of time allowing domestic consumers to reduce their purchase prices 
prices for non ferrous metals reached record levels in  as the demand for metals continues to outpace supplies 
while the year saw the global aluminum industry record a deficit in supply  thus pushing aluminum prices past year highs  the scenario was not much different in the case of other non ferrous metals on account of depleting stockpiles and sustained demand 
the situation was similar in the case of copper where prices too have soared to lifetime highs 
the lead fabrication and recycling segment is influenced by the price of lead raw metals 
the lead fabrication and recycling businesses can be positively affected by lower pricing of raw lead metals while the smelting businesses are negatively affected by lower pricing 
during  and the first half of the pricing of raw lead metals was at low levels due primarily to strong supply into the us principally by china and the us government selling off warehoused stockpiles 
beginning with the third quarter of  pricing of lead raw materials began to increase 
many explanations have been offered for the increase including china changing from a net supplier of lead to a net consumer  increased demand because of recovery of the us and many other foreign economies and a general recovery in the metal markets 
between december  and december   the price of lead on the london metal exchange increased 
in a business environment of increasing raw material costs like this  lead fabricators rely on their ability to pass on these increased lead raw material prices to maintain their profitability 
revenue in the lead fabrication and recycling segment  for the years ended december   and  include one specific customer which accounted for or more of total revenue of the company in one of those years  together with the receivable due from the customer revenue to customer as a percentage of sales receivable balance at end of period year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales increased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  the purchase of the remaining joint venture interest in mayco industries  llc on september  subsequently converted to mayco industries  inc added an additional million and million in sales to the years ended december  and respectively or a net increase of million 
excluding the sales effect of the mayco purchase  consolidated net sales increased by million 
this increase in sales is due to higher sales volume of million offset by lower average selling prices of  scrap metal recycling ferrous sales ferrous sales decreased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to ferrous sales of million in the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to a decrease in average selling prices accounting for million of the decrease in sales of ferrous products offset by a increase in sales volumes or an additional thousand tons representing sales of million 
the average selling price for ferrous products was approximately per ton for the year ended december   compared to per ton for the year ended december  as discussed above  pricing was impacted by domestic and foreign buyers 
the increase in ferrous volumes can largely be attributed to our november acquisition of a competitor in rochester  new york 

table of contents non ferrous sales non ferrous sales increased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to non ferrous sales of million in the year ended december  the increase was due to higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes 
the average selling price for non ferrous products was approximately per pound for the year ended december   compared to per pound for the year ended december   an increase of approximately accounting for approximately million of the total increase in non ferrous sales 
an increase in sales volume of approximately million pounds sold contributed million to the total increase in sales of non ferrous products 
the increase in non ferrous volumes can largely be attributed to our november acquisition of a competitor in rochester  new york 
lead fabrication and recycling sales in our lead fabrication and recycling segment increased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to sales of million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in sales is the purchase of the remaining joint venture interest of mayco industries  llc on september  lead fabrication lead fabrication sales increased by million in versus the increase to sales as a result of the mayco purchase amounted to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  producing a net incremental increase of million for the year ended december  lead smelting refined lead sales decreased by  in versus for the year ended december   the company experienced a million decrease in sales volume offset by a  increase in average selling prices 
the average selling price for refined lead increased approximately per pound or from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  a decrease in reportable sales was attributable to the effect of the september  mayco joint venture interest acquisition on our smelting operation in tampa  florida 
in the previous year  the company reflected million pounds amounting to million in reportable sales to mayco however  due to the purchase of the remaining interest in mayco  these sales were eliminated in consolidation for the year ended december  sales volumes in were also affected by production issues at the plant during the first half of which have been addressed and resolved by year end 
table of contents lead tolling tolling arrangements receive an agreed upon amount for each pound of lead processed for a customer 
refined lead sales per pound exceed the tolling amount per pound sold because they include the cost of raw materials 
tolling activity is primarily performed at our tampa  florida smelting facility and  as indicated in the preceding paragraph  production inefficiencies in tampa contributed to a lack of profitability in our tolling operations in tolling sales decreased by million or at our lead smelting facility from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in an effort to increase overall profit margins  our gulf coast recycling  inc subsidiary has focused efforts on reducing its tolling services to concentrate more on sales of alloyed lead  further contributing to decreased tolling profitability 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to operating expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase in dollars was primarily due to the mayco joint venture interest acquisition  which accounted for approximately million of the increase  combined with a million increase in the cost of purchased metals and a million increase in other operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs is primarily due to the mayco joint venture interest acquisition on september  the current year reflects a full year of additional expenses due to mayco compared to only the last quarter of  the net effect adding an additional million 
excluding the mayco effect  legal and accounting fees increased by  primarily because of one time costs associated with the registration of the company s common stock with securities and exchange commission in and related corporate activities 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million or of sales for the year ended december   compared to million or of sales for the year ended december  the increase is due to the net effect of the mayco acquisition which added an additional  in depreciation and amortization as well as the depreciation of a greater balance of depreciable assets in as compared to  of which million in depreciable additions were recorded during 
table of contents operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  and is a result of the factors discussed above 
financial and other income expense interest expense was million or of sales during the year ended december   compared to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense during resulted primarily from higher interest rates incurred on higher average outstanding variable rate debt balances 
in  the average interest rate on our variable rate debt was on a daily average outstanding balance of million compared to on a daily average outstanding balance of million in income from joint venture equity in net income of mayco industries  llc mayco industries  inc since september  was million for the nine months ended september  on september   the company purchased the interest in mayco industries  llc that it did not previously own  and for the fourth quarter of and all of  the results of mayco are reported in the consolidated totals 
income taxes for the year ended december  the company recognized income tax expense of million  resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 
for the year ended december  the company recognized income tax expense of million  resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 
the increase in effective income tax rates is the result of changes in business allocation percentages in certain states in which we operate which have impacted available net operating loss carryforwards 
we expect that the future effective combined federal and state tax rates to range between and

the company also recorded accrued liabilities for future and anticipated environmental monitoring costs and post closure maintenance costs for the college grove tennessee facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales increased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  the million increase in consolidated net sales is due to higher average selling prices accounting for million of the total increase in sales  the purchase of the remaining joint venture interest in mayco industries  llc on september  added an additional million in sales and an increase in volume sold totaling million 
additionally  the acquisition of a scrap handling company in february and an additional scrap yard in november contributed another million and  respectively  to the total increase in sales 
the million increase in volume is comprised of increases in sales volumes for ferrous products of million and non ferrous products of million offset by a million decrease in sales volumes for our lead fabricating and recycling segment excluding mayco and a million decrease in tolling activities 
scrap metal recycling ferrous sales ferrous sales increased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to ferrous sales of million in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a increase in average selling prices accounting for million of the total increase in sales of ferrous products combined with a increase in sales volumes or an additional thousand tons representing an increase in sales of million

table of contents we are involved in certain other legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such other proceedings and litigation will not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical however we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   variable rate borrowings mainly consisted of outstanding borrowings of million under our senior secured credit facility 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
any increase in either the prime rate or libor will increase interest expense 
we do not have any interest rate swaps or caps in place which would mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on this indebtedness 
assuming our variable borrowings were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year  with a corresponding change in cash flows 

table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and import and export markets can be volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly instead of holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates
