item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a leading global publisher of interactive software games designed for personal computers  and video game consoles and handheld platforms manufactured by sony  microsoft and nintendo 
we also distribute our products as well as third party software  hardware and accessories to retail outlets in north america through our jack of all games subsidiary  and we have sales  marketing and publishing operations in australia  austria  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  italy  new zealand  spain and the united kingdom 
our principal sources of revenue are derived from publishing and distribution operations 
publishing revenues are derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by third parties 
operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new  commercially successful products and to manage costs associated with business acquisitions and software product development 
we develop most of our frontline products internally  and we own major intellectual properties  which we believe permits us to maximize profitability 
operating margins for titles developed by third parties  or for which we do not own the intellectual property  are affected by costs to acquire licenses and amounts due to developers 
our distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third party software titles  accessories and hardware 
operating margins in our distribution business are dependent in part on the mix of software and hardware sales  with software generating higher margins than hardware 
publishing activities generate significantly higher margins than distribution activities  with sales of pc software titles resulting in higher margins than sales of products designed for video game consoles and handheld platforms 
we have pursued a growth strategy by capitalizing on the widespread market acceptance of video game consoles  as well as the growing popularity of innovative action games that appeal to mature audiences 
we have established a portfolio of successful proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms 
we expect to continue to be a leader in the mature  action product category by leveraging our existing franchises and developing new brands 
the esrb  through its ratings system  requires game publishers to provide consumers with information relating to graphic violence  profanity or sexually explicit material contained in software titles 
consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns  and various governmental bodies have proposed regulation aimed at our industry to prohibit the sale of software containing such material to minors 
additionally  retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material that they deem inappropriate for their businesses 
many of our rockstar titles have received an m rating 
if retailers decline to sell our m rated products or if our m rated products are re rated ao  we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles  which in the case of our best selling grand theft auto titles could seriously hurt our business 
the esrb requires publishers to conduct pertinent content audit certifications with respect to certain top selling titles  the objective of which is to assess what portion  if any  of the games on the market include undisclosed pertinent content on the disc that undermines the accuracy of the esrb rating 
this self audit procedure applies to certain current titles and may be applied to additional titles in the future 
we are currently conducting a self audit in accordance with the esrb s requirements 
it is possible that there may be content in our games that could be determined to be pertinent content that causes a change to our current esrb rating 
in such event  we may be required to record a reserve for anticipated product returns and inventory obsolescence which could expose us to additional litigation  administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities  and could adversely affect our operating results 
we have diversified our product offerings by capitalizing on significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and other licensed action and strategy titles 
during fiscal  we made several strategic acquisitions of leading sports development studios and entered into license agreements with major sports leagues to develop sports titles 
we also entered into license agreements for several popular entertainment properties  acquired well known intellectual property rights  and entered into distribution and publishing arrangements for major action and strategy pc titles

back to index planning the launch of the revolution console system in during this transition to next generation hardware platforms  our operating results may become more volatile and more difficult to predict
