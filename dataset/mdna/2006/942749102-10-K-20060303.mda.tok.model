item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe 
for over years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial  residential and light industrial applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include backflow preventers for preventing contamination of potable water caused by reverse flow within water supply lines and fire protection systems  a wide range of water pressure regulators for both commercial and residential applications  water supply and drainage products for commercial and residential applications  temperature and pressure relief valves for water heaters  boilers and associated systems  point of use water filtration and reverse osmosis systems for both commercial and residential applications  thermostatic mixing valves for tempering water in commercial and residential applications  systems for under floor radiant applications and hydraulic pump groups for gas boiler manufacturers  and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications 
our business is reported in three geographic segments  north america  europe and china 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels  wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
interest rates have an indirect effect on the demand for our products due to the effect such rates have on the number of new residential and commercial construction starts and remodeling projects 
residential and commercial construction starts have an impact on our levels of sales and earnings 
in  organic segment sales in our north american wholesale and diy markets combined increased by approximately over the prior year 
also in  organic segment sales in europe increased by approximately over the prior year despite a weak european economy 
an additional factor that has had an effect on our sales is fluctuation in foreign currencies  as a portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  increased demand for clean water and continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed twenty five acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water safety  water conservation  water flow control and related complimentary markets 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the residential and commercial markets 
in  sales from acquisitions contributed approximately to our total sales growth over the prior period 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a barrier to entry for competitors 
we believe there is an increasing demand among consumers for products to ensure water quality  which creates growth opportunities for our products 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic  and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
we have experienced increases in the costs of certain raw materials  particularly copper 
bronze and brass are copper based alloys 
during  spot copper cost increased approximately 
additionally  due to increases in the cost of crude oil  the costs of certain plastic resins we use increased approximately between and during a risk we face is our ability to deal effectively with increases in raw material costs 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary  implementing cost reduction programs and passing increases in costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  we use commodity futures contracts to manage this risk  although we do not currently have any such contracts 
in response to recent cost increases  we have implemented price increases for some of the products which have become more expensive to manufacture due to the increases in raw material costs 
in  cost increases in raw materials were not completely recovered by increased selling prices or other product cost reductions 
we are not able to predict whether or for how long these cost increases will continue 
if these cost increases continue and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases  our profit margins could decrease 
another risk we face in all areas of our business is competition 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
as mentioned previously  we believe that product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a barrier to entry for competitors 
we are committed to maintaining our capital equipment at a level consistent with current technologies  and thus we spent approximately million in and million in we are committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity in lower cost countries such as china  tunisia and bulgaria 
these manufacturing plant relocations and consolidations are an important part of our ongoing commitment to reduce production costs 
recent developments on february   we declared a quarterly dividend of nine cents per share on the company s class a common stock and class b common stock 
this is an increase of per share compared to the dividend paid for the comparable period last year

our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap

management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define net debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of long term debt including current portion to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below december  in thousands current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents net debt a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in thousands net debt total stockholders equity plus minority interest capitalization net debt to capitalization ratio we anticipate that available funds from current operations  existing cash  our revolving credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may have to consider external sources of financing for any large future acquisitions 
our long term contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations  including current maturities a operating lease obligations capital lease obligations a pension contributions other b total a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet  includes  in bonds due in less than one year from the dormont acquisition to be settled by the former owners see note to the consolidated financial statements b includes acquisition related agreement  commodity and capital expenditure commitments at december  in november  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets and business of changsha valve works located in changsha  china 
changsha valve works is a leading manufacturer of large diameter hydraulic actuated butterfly valves for thermo power and hydro power plants  water distribution projects and water works projects in china 
consummation of the acquisition remains subject to the fulfillment of certain closing conditions by changsha valve works 
we have entered into a preliminary agreement where we will purchase a building located in northern italy from the local italian government and  simultaneously  sell to the local italian government one of our facilities in northern italy 
this transaction is expected to be consummated in march the purchase price of the new building approximates  the selling price for our existing building approximates  with a book value of approximately  it is management s intention to finance the purchase of this new building under a sale and lease back arrangement  however  the specific terms and conditions of the financing have not yet been determined 
therefore  payments on the future financing have not been included in the contractual obligations schedule above 
in a related transaction  we have an agreement to sell another building in northern italy to a private third party for approximately  we expect that this transaction will be consummated in the fourth quarter of the book value of this building approximates  these transactions are part of our strategy to consolidate our italian manufacturing activities 
we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding for total letters of credit were approximately  as of december  and  as of december  our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and to a lesser extent foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
the increase is primarily associated with increased foreign purchases 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down  therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
we own a interest in www 
plumbworld

uk limited plumbworld  a variable interest entity 
plumbworld is primarily an e business that sells bathroom and sanitary appliances  as well as plumbing and heating products  tools and plumbing consumables 
its latest fiscal year sales were approximately  we have a nominal investment of approximately in plumbworld and maintain a loan receivable in the amount of approximately  with plumbworld 
we have entered into an agreement with the majority shareholders of plumbworld to exchange our ownership interest for full receipt of our loan receivable 
we expect to receive installment payments through september  at which time we will relinquish our shares in plumbworld 
we continue to account for our investment in plumbworld using the equity method 
critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in accounting policies or significant changes in accounting estimates during we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with the audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record customer programs as an adjustment to net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in north america  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves against financially troubled customers 
in addition  factors are developed utilizing historical trends in bad debts  returns and allowances 
the ratio of these factors to sales on a rolling twelve month basis is applied to total outstanding receivables net of accounts specifically identified to establish a reserve 
in europe  management develops their bad debt allowance through an aging analysis of all their accounts 
in china  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves as needed 
in addition  for waterworks customers  whose payment terms are generally extended  we reserve the majority of accounts receivable in excess of one year from the invoice date 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the credit worthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs generally determined on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas on january   and as a result we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fas we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
we perform our annual test for indications of goodwill impairment on the last day of our fiscal october  which was october for fiscal intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
since the adoption of fas our valuations have been greater than the carrying value of our goodwill and intangibles 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as future sales volume  selling price changes  material cost changes  cost savings programs and capital expenditures could significantly affect our valuations 
other changes that may affect our valuations include  but are not limited to product acceptances and regulatory approval 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
for product liability cases in the us  management estimates expected settlement costs by utilizing loss reports provided by our third party administrators as well as developing internal historical trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
management utilizes the internal trend factors that reflect final expected settlement costs 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for contingencies fas  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve this litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
final settlement of these matters could possibly result in significant effects on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions fas 
in applying fas  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in the above assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material discrepancies from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 inventory costs fas 
fas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for inventory costs 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   although early application is permitted 
we do not expect that the impact of this statement will be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  financial accounting standards board statement no 
r fas r that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the statement applies to all outstanding and unvested sbp awards at a company s adoption date 
the securities and exchange commission delayed implementation to fiscal years beginning after june  therefore  we implemented fas r effective january  using the modified prospective method  which requires recognizing expense for options over their remaining vesting period 
the portion of these options fair value attributable to vested awards prior to the adoption is never recognized 
the impact of this statement on our results of operations based on equity instruments outstanding at december  for the fiscal year ending december  is expected to be approximately per share 
in december  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions fas 
the amendments made by fas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion no 
required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance 
the provisions of this statement are being applied prospectively as of january in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas and serves to clarify that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate such a liability 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we concluded that fin did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of december  in may  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and a replacement of fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas changes the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
the statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions  unless it is impracticable to do so 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars  are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese yuan 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies  the yuan  or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
in and  the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income for the change in the fair value of such contracts was immaterial 
we have historically had a very low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt instruments and reduce interest expense on certain fixed rate instruments 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  we use commodity futures contracts to manage this risk  but we did not use such contracts in or
