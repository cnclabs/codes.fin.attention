item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to stock based compensation  inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal year  the company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r 
under sfas r  compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the vesting period 
the company uses the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes valuation model requires the company to estimate key assumptions such as expected term  volatility  dividend yields and risk free interest rates that determine the stock options fair value 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to its results of operations 
in addition  sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
the company estimates forfeitures based on its historical activity  as it believes these forfeiture rates to be indicative of its expected forfeiture rate 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
the company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand 
the company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability  obsolescence  historical experience and current business conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  the company may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title  which generally occurs at the time of shipment 
revenue from the company s sales to domestic distributors is generally recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
as a result  the company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise 
the company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms 
the income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company has reserves to cover expected product returns 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations  the company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns 
generally  changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  such as the tax benefit for export sales  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if the company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  in concert with a review of its total tax liabilities  it may reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it determines that the liability is no longer necessary 
the company will also record an additional charge to its provision for taxes in the period in which it determines that the recorded tax liability is less than it expects the ultimate assessment to be

estimates of future performance are uncertain  and past performance of the company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the company  its competitors  the semiconductor industry and the overall economy 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  cyclical market patterns  periodic oversupply conditions  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
furthermore  new product introductions and patent protection of existing products  as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits if brought against the company  are factors that can influence future sales growth and sustained profitability 
the company s headquarters  and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
consequently  the company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although the company believes that it has the product lines  manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations  sales and profitability could be significantly affected by factors described above and other factors 
additionally  the company s common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community 
furthermore  stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
liquidity and capital resources at july   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion and working capital was also billion 
the company s accounts receivable balance increased million from million at the end of fiscal year to million at the end of fiscal year the increase is due to higher revenues from product sales while day sales outstanding dso remained relatively unchanged at days 
other non current assets increased million from million at the end of fiscal year to million at the end of fiscal year due to the company making an investment in a digital power semiconductor company 
this increase was partially offset by amortization of long term technology licenses 
the company s accrued payroll and related benefits balance increased million from million at the end of fiscal year to million at the end of fiscal year the increase is primarily due to increases in the company s profit sharing accrual 
the company accrues for profit sharing on a quarterly basis while distributing payouts to employees on a semi annual basis during the first and third quarters 
during fiscal year  the company generated million of cash from operating activities  million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock plans  and proceeds from net sales of short term investments of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
based upon the weighted average duration of the company s investments at july   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the company s investments totaling approximately million 
however  because the company s debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
these investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the company generally holds securities until maturity 
the company s sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly  the company s sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on the results of operations
