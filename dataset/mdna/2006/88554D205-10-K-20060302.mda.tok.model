overview we design  develop  manufacture  market and service rapid d printing  prototyping and manufacturing systems and related products  materials and customer services that enable complex three dimensional objects to be produced directly from computer data without tooling  greatly reducing the time and cost required to produce prototypes or customized production parts 
our consolidated revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our systems  the sale of the related materials used by the systems to produce solid objects and the provision of services to our customers 
growth strategy we are pursuing a growth strategy that focuses on seven strategic initiatives improving our customer s bottom line developing significant product applications expanding the range of customer services accelerating new product development optimizing cash flow and our supply chain creating a performance based ethical culture developing people and opportunities improving our customer s bottom line 
we believe that our success depends on the success of our customers 
understanding our customers objectives and businesses should enable us to quickly incorporate their needs into our product offerings and to offer them effective solutions to their business needs 
by offering them effective solutions to their needs  we should be able to provide them with solutions that significantly improve their own profitability 
developing significant product applications 
we believe that our ability to focus on industries that provide significant growth opportunities enables us to accelerate the adoption of our business solutions and to create significant new applications for a continually expanding customer base 
by focusing our efforts on two significant addressable opportunities  d printing and rapid manufacturing  we are working to build a business model that can provide sustained growth  that has predictable performance characteristics  and whose performance should be less sensitive to cyclical economic behavior 
expanding our range of customer services 
we believe that our desire to improve our customer s bottom line demands the creation of new and innovative services designed to meet specific customer needs 
we are working to establish faster  simpler business practices designed to make our customers experience with us easier and friendlier 
accelerating new product development 
we believe that our growth depends on our ability to bring to market new materials  systems and services through quick and targeted development cycles 
technology and innovation are at the heart of this initiative 
as an industry leader  we believe that the only sure way to sustain growth is through our commitment to technological leadership 
optimizing cash flow and supply chain 
we believe that our profitability  competitiveness and cash flow should be enhanced by our ability to optimize our overall manufacturing operations and supply chain 
through the implementation of lean order to cash operations  coupled with selective strategic outsourcing  we are working to derive tangible operating improvements and to improve our overall return on assets 
creating a performance based ethical culture 
we believe that the success of our strategic initiatives will depend on our ability to execute them within the framework of a performance based culture dedicated to meeting the needs of our customers  stockholders and other constituencies  supported by a corporate culture that is committed to strong principles of business ethics and compliance with law 
we recognize the need to align our performance with our organizational capabilities and practices and our strategic vision to enable us to grow at the rate we expect  to drive operating improvements at the rate we expect  and to make the progress against targets necessary to create the necessary alignment 
developing people and opportunities 
we believe that our success depends heavily on the skill and motivation of our employees and that we must therefore invest in the skills that our employees possess and those that we need to accomplish our strategic initiatives 
as with any growth strategy  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in accomplishing our strategic initiatives 
results table below sets out the amounts and percentages of our revenue by class of product and service for each of the three years ended december  table dollars in thousands systems and other products materials services totals consolidated revenue increased in each of and compared to the immediately preceding year  continuing a trend that began in the fourth quarter of revenue from systems and materials increased in compared to while revenue from services decreased 
revenue from each of our classes of products and services increased in compared to our trend of improving operating results began in the fourth quarter of since then  our revenue has increased in each quarter  year over year 
we have reported operating income for each quarter since the second quarter of we have also reported net income available to common stockholders for each consecutive quarter since the third quarter of while we currently expect this favorable trend of improving operating results to continue  there can be no assurance that it will continue 
for  as discussed in greater detail below revenue rose to a record million 
we introduced new products and services in addition to the new products and services that we introduced from the latter part of through the end of certain of these new products contributed significantly to our higher level of revenue in and as discussed above  these new products include our family of d printers  our new stereolithography and selective laser sintering systems and a range of new materials designed to differentiate the solutions we offer our customers from those available from others and to serve a variety of customer needs 
revenue from systems and other products increased in compared with  primarily reflecting continuing strong unit growth from new systems that we have introduced since the latter part of and the favorable combined effect of price and mix 
revenue from materials increased by in compared to  primarily reflecting strong unit growth in the sale of new materials 
revenue from our growing family of proprietary consumable materials reached a record high of million in revenue from services declined in compared to  primarily due to lower revenue from customer training  maintenance and upgrade services  reflecting a deliberate shift in our marketing strategy to de emphasize our ongoing support of certain legacy systems 
recurring revenue from materials and services rose to million from million in and million in but decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in  reflecting the strong growth in sales of new systems in and a decrease in revenue from services 
we expect these recurring revenues to continue to increase with higher sales of new systems  and under our target operating model we are working as one of our business objectives to build recurring revenue from materials and services to be in excess of of total revenue 
there can of course be no assurance that we will achieve this business objective 
revenue growth was led by our north american and asia pacific regions  which grew and  respectively  compared to revenue from our growing d printing business exceeded million  reflecting our continued success in expanding our portfolio of d printing products and applications 
operating expenses continued to decline in as a percentage of revenue in spite of a million increase in research and development expenses and million of special costs in connection with our previously announced plans to relocate our headquarters and r d facilities to rock hill  south carolina 
income from operations increased to million from million in this was primarily the result of our higher revenue and gross profit in  partially offset by modestly higher operating expenses 
for the second year in a row  our business generated operating profits and positive net income per share 
helped by the tax benefits discussed below  net income available to common stockholders increased eight fold to million from million in this was primarily the result of higher operating income  lower interest and other expense  net and a million benefit from income taxes  partially offset by higher preferred stock dividends 
see results of operations for  and provisions for benefit of income taxes below 
diluted income per share rose to for from in the net effect of the million non cash tax benefit mentioned above  which had the effect of increasing net income  and the partially offsetting million of special costs related to our relocation to rock hill  south carolina  mentioned above accounted for million or per share of the increase in net income available to the common stockholders for significant investments in new product development and working capital for new product roll outs resulted in slightly lower unrestricted cash of million at the end of our increasing profitability and favorable outlook enabled us to reduce the valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets in previous years and to begin to recognize the benefit of our previously accumulated losses to reduce our taxable income 
the valuation allowance reduction produced million of tax benefits in that more than offset our provision for income taxes in  and we anticipate that continued profitable results and favorable outlook should permit additional reductions in future periods of our million valuation allowance at december  our deferred tax assets include  among other things  tax savings anticipated from more than million of consolidated net operating loss carry forwards 
although backlog has historically not been a significant factor in our business  reflecting our relatively short production and delivery lead times  we had approximately million of booked orders outstanding at december   primarily for systems  all of which we expect to ship in systems orders and sales tend to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the types of systems ordered by customers  customer acceptance of newly introduced products  the timing of product orders and shipments  global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our customers generally purchase our systems as capital equipment items  and their purchasing decisions may have a long lead time 
due to the relatively high list price of certain systems and the overall low unit volume of sales in any particular period  the acceleration or delay of orders and shipments of a small number of systems from one period to another can significantly affect revenue reported for our systems sales for the period involved 
revenue reported for systems sales in any particular period is also affected by revenue recognition rules prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
however  as noted above  production and delivery of our systems is generally not characterized by long lead times  and backlog is therefore generally not a material factor in our business 
results of operations for  and consolidated revenue the principal factors affecting our consolidated revenue in the three years ended december  were changes in unit volume  the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices  and foreign currency translation 
as used in this management s discussion and analysis  the combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices  sometimes referred to as price and mix  relates to changes in revenue that are not able to be specifically related to changes in unit volume 
among these changes are changes in the product mix of our systems as the trend toward smaller  more economical systems that has affected our business for the past several years has continued and the influence of new products has grown 
for  consolidated revenue increased to million from million in in  consolidated revenue increased from million in the increase in consolidated revenue in both and was primarily due to higher unit sales from new products and services and the combined effect of price and mix 
in each year  this increase was partially offset by lower revenue from our core legacy products and services  reflecting a continuing trend in lower revenue from those products and services 
foreign currency translation  which added million to consolidated revenue in  had a million adverse effect on consolidated revenue in as the us dollar strengthened against the foreign currencies in which we transact business in expressed in percentage terms  the effect of foreign currency translation in was to reduce our growth in revenue by percentage point while in it had the effect of increasing our revenue growth by percentage points 
sales of new products and services introduced since the latter part of increased by million to million in and by million to million in revenue from new products and services was of consolidated revenue in and of consolidated revenue in new systems and materials introduced since the fourth quarter of that contributed to our higher revenue in included our new sinterstation pro sls systems  our new viper pro sla systems  our d printers and various of our new materials 
new systems and materials introduced that contributed to our higher revenue in included our standard invision d printer  our high resolution invision hr d printer  the sinterstation hiq sls system and visijet  amethyst and laserform a materials 
revenue from other new products was not material to our operating results in either or our higher level of consolidated revenue in overcame the adverse effect we experienced in and prior years of increased demand by customers for lower cost and smaller frame systems  a reduction in the volume of stereolithography materials that we sold following the termination of a distribution agreement with a supplier in and the subsequent introduction of our own stereolithography materials  limited new product introductions in and prior years  and customer concerns in and prior years regarding our financial performance and stability 
revenue by class of product and service compared to as shown in table  the million increase in consolidated revenue for was primarily due to new product volume and the combined effect of price and mix  partially offset by lower volume of our core older products and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
sales of new products and services introduced since the latter part of increased by to million in but were partly offset by million of lower sales of our core products and services  continuing their downward trend 
the components of this million increase in revenue as they relate to our classes of products and services for are shown in the following table  together with the corresponding percentage of that change compared to the level of revenue for that product or service

net change in consolidated revenue as set forth in table and table revenue in from systems and other products increased to million from million in revenue from systems and other products represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from systems and other products was primarily due to million of increases in unit volume arising from sales of our newer systems and the favorable combined effect of price and mix  partially offset by a million decline in core product unit volume and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects 
revenue from materials increased to million in from million for revenue from materials represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from materials was primarily due to million arising from higher unit sales of new products and the million favorable combined effect of price and mix  partially offset by a million decline in core product unit volume and a million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
revenue from services decreased to million for from million for revenue from services represented  and of consolidated revenue for  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from services was principally due to a net million decline in unit volume of our core services that more than offset an increase in new services  and by the million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
compared to as shown in table  the million increase in consolidated revenue for was primarily due to new product volume  the combined effect of price and mix and favorable foreign currency translation

net change in consolidated revenue as set forth in table and table revenue from systems and other products increased to million in from million in revenue from systems and other products represented and of consolidated revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from systems and other products in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit sales of our new systems and a favorable million effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by a million decline in unit sales of our mature equipment systems and a million combined effect of changes in product mix and average selling prices 
the partially offsetting effect of product mix and average selling prices on revenue from systems was primarily due to price declines in mature systems 
the decline in systems sales as a percentage of consolidated revenue reflected primarily the price change differential between mature systems and materials from to revenue from materials increased to million for from million for revenue from materials represented and of consolidated revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from materials in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit sales of new products  a million favorable combined effect of price and mix and a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by a million decline in unit volume of our mature materials 
revenue from services increased to million for from million for revenue from services represented and of consolidated revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from services in was primarily due to million arising from higher unit volume and to the million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the higher unit volume in was primarily derived from services related to our new invision d printers and installation of upgrade kits for sinterstation hiq sls systems  and  to a lesser extent  from expanded services for mature systems 
revenue by geographic region the united states and the asia pacific region were the principal contributors to our higher level of revenue in european revenue decreased modestly in each geographic area in which we operate contributed to our higher revenue in compared to that in revenue by geographic area in which we operate is shown in the following table 
table year ended december  dollars in thousands us operations european operations asia pacific operations total revenue compared to the components of our million increase in revenue by geographic region for are shown in table  together with the corresponding percentage of that change compared to the level of revenue for the corresponding period of for that geographic area 
on a consolidated basis  this million increase resulted from million of higher unit volume contributed by the us and the asia pacific region and million due to the favorable combined effect of price and mix  partially offset by a decline in unit volume in europe and the million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation  derived from both europe and the asia pacific region 
table us europe asia pacific net change in consolidated revenue dollars in thousands volume price mix foreign currency translation 
net change in consolidated revenue as set forth in tables and revenue from us operations increased by million or to million for from million for the growth in revenue from us operations was primarily due to higher unit volume  as we realized the benefits of the restructuring of the us sales organization  aided by the combined effect of price and mix 
revenue from us operations represented and of consolidated revenue for and  respectively 
revenue from operations outside the us was essentially flat at million for compared to million for but decreased to of consolidated revenue for from of consolidated revenue for  reflecting the effect of the higher growth in revenue in the us expressed in percentage terms  the effect of foreign currency translation on revenue from operations outside the us was to reduce it by percentage points for as a percentage of consolidated revenue 
compared to our revenue from operations outside the united states  the effect of the million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation in was to reduce revenue from those operations by percentage points 
revenue from asia pacific operations increased by million or to million for from million for this increase in revenue resulted primarily from higher unit volume and the favorable combined effect of price and mix  partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
asia pacific revenue represented and of consolidated revenue for and  respectively 
the favorable performance of our asia pacific operations was largely offset by lower revenue from our european operations  which decreased by million or to million for from million for this decrease was due primarily to million of lower revenue arising from lower unit volume and the adverse effect of foreign currency translation  partially offset by million from the favorable combined effect of price and mix

costs and margins we experienced an improvement in gross profit and gross profit margin in each of and compared to the immediately preceding year 
gross profit increased to million in and to million in from million in table year ended december  gross profit revenue gross profit revenue gross profit revenue dollars in thousands products services total the million increase in gross profit in was due primarily to our higher unit volume and the favorable combined effect of price and mix 
the million increase in gross profit in was due primarily to increased revenue  including favorable foreign exchange translation effects on revenue  and favorable combined price and mix changes 
our gross profit margin increased percentage points to of consolidated revenue in as the percentage point increase in product margins in was largely offset by a decline in service margins and the adverse foreign currency transaction items discussed below 
gross profit margin increased percentage points to of consolidated revenue in compared to in reflecting higher margins in both products and services in compared to as one of our business objectives  we are working to manage our gross profit margin to be in the range of to of revenue as our business grows 
while the gross profit margin of our products reached in  the lower gross profit margin of our services resulted in a combined gross profit margin 
there can  of course  be no assurance that our longer term business objective will be achieved 
cost of sales  which is the principal influence on gross profit  increased to million in and to million in from million in however  as a percentage of consolidated revenue  cost of sales declined to of revenue in and to of revenue in from of consolidated revenue in  resulting in an improvement in gross profit margin in each year 
the increase in cost of sales in was due primarily to our higher volume 
foreign currency transaction items had a million unfavorable effect on cost of sales compared to  resulting in a percentage point reduction in gross profit 
the increase in cost of sales in was due primarily to our higher volume  partially offset by a favorable net impact of product and service costs and mix changes 
systems costs per unit were generally lower due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies  partially offset by production ramp up costs associated with the introduction of new products and under absorbed direct manufacturing costs associated with the outsourcing of our equipment assembly activities to third parties 
materials costs increased on balance as a result of mix changes 
service costs benefited from lower warranty costs and performance efficiencies 
gross profit margin for products increased to of consolidated product revenue in from of consolidated product revenue 
the increase in product margins in was due primarily to higher unit sales of new systems and materials  lower costs from our outsourcing activities and the favorable combined effect of price and mix  but we did not realize the full benefit of those improvements because of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead arising from our outsourcing activities  additional costs associated with rollout of two major new systems in and adverse foreign exchange transaction effects 
gross profit margin for products increased to of consolidated product revenue in from of consolidated product revenue 
the increase in product margins in was due primarily to increased revenue  including net favorable foreign currency effects  net cost increases which were proportionately less than revenue increases for the reasons mentioned above and favorable mix changes  partially offset by costs associated with carrying out customer conversions to our materials from materials provided by other suppliers 
gross profit margin on services decreased to of consolidated service revenue for from of consolidated service revenue 
service margins in were adversely affected by lower sales of upgrades for older legacy systems  by higher training and field service activity and by a special compensation related charge 
gross profit margin on services increased to of consolidated service revenue for from of consolidated service revenue 
service margins in continued to benefit from higher revenue and lower costs associated with lower warranty costs and greater performance efficiencies 
operating expenses as shown in table  total operating expenses increased by million or to million in after having declined to million in compared to the increase in was primarily due to million of higher research and development expenses  reflecting our continuing commitment of resources to research and development projects and new product developments  and million of severance and restructuring costs  primarily arising from our planned relocation to rock hill  south carolina 
those severance and restructuring costs constituted more than of the increase in operating expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in operating expenses continued to decline in as a percentage of revenue  amounting to of revenue in  of revenue in and of revenue in as one of our business objectives  we are working to manage our operating expenses to be in the range of to of revenue as our business grows 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve this objective 
table year ended december  amount revenue amount revenue amount revenue dollars in thousands sg a r d severance and restructuring costs total selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million in compared to after declining by million during compared to however  selling  general and administrative expenses continued their downward trend as a percentage of revenue in and were  and of consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to a million reduction in legal fees and expenses as a result of our settlement in of various legacy legal matters discussed below  that was more than offset by the absence in of a million benefit in of reductions for accruals in healthcare costs and bad debt allowances both discussed below and environmental reserves  a million increase in bonuses and commissions  sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs  and an increase in accounting fees  predominantly related to costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of for  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to million from million in this million decline was due primarily to a million decline in legal costs  primarily related to reduced patent litigation costs as a result of litigation settlements during and the absence in of legal fees incurred in related to our revenue recognition investigation relating to and previous years  million of lower costs related to depreciation  travel and entertainment expenses  outside vendor processing costs  consulting professional fees and utility costs  million of lower bad debt expense  discussed below  the absence in of the million impairment charge in related to technology associated with the curtailed product commercialization efforts in our optoform sarl unit  and million of lower accounting fees associated with the absence in of costs incurred in related to our revenue recognition investigation  partially offset by million of higher fees and expenses related to our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and million of higher employee compensation  recruitment and relocation expenses 
in  legal costs amounted to million compared to million in and million in in  these costs included million of fees and expenses associated with the completion of the settlement of previously outstanding litigation and with our compliance with sec and department of justice subpoenas that we had received in on october   we received a letter from the sec stating that it had closed its investigation of our revenue recognition practices and did not intend to recommend any enforcement action with respect to us 
during  we began to realize the benefit of replacing the self insured medical benefit program that we had maintained prior to with a third party insured program in february employee benefit expenses declined in primarily as a result of the adoption of this new insured program and included a million decrease in our reserve for future claims under the former self insured program 
bad debt expense was nominal for  compared to a million credit for that reflected a million reduction from the million of bad debt expense in our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
days sales outstanding dso increased from days at december  to days at december  primarily due to the timing of new systems shipments late in the fourth quarter of dso declined from days at december  to days at december  due to tighter credit and collection management during receivables more than days past due represented  and of gross accounts receivable outstanding at december   and  respectively 
we expect most of the increase in accounts receivable at december  to be collected during the first quarter of and to decline in the first quarter of except to the extent of new sales in the first quarter 
see liquidity and capital resources working capital below 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  which relates to the expensing of stock options and certain other equity compensation  we began to expense previously issued equity awards for which service has not been rendered beginning on january  as of december   we estimate our maximum expense for existing stock options as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r to be approximately million  of which million would be recognized for and million would be recognized for this projected expense will change if any stock options are granted  which we do not expect to occur  or cancelled prior to the respective reporting periods or if any changes are required to be made for estimated forfeitures as of january  as of december   we estimate our expense for outstanding restricted stock awards to be approximately million  which would be recognized million for  million for  million for and million for this projected expense will change if any restricted stock awards are granted  which we expect to occur  or repurchased prior to vesting in any of the respective reporting periods 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in and to million in from million in we anticipate that we will continue to devote our efforts to selected research and development projects and new product developments during and that  as a result  research and development expenses should be in the range of million to million for severance and restructuring costs 
severance and other restructuring costs amounted to million in  million in and million in our severance and other restructuring costs in related primarily to costs incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with our planned relocation to rock hill  south carolina 
these costs included million of personnel  relocation and recruiting costs and approximately million of non cash charges associated with accelerated amortization and asset impairments  and they were generally in line with our previously announced estimate for we estimate that  during  the total pretax costs to complete this relocation and consolidation should be in the range of million to million 
this amount includes estimated cash expenditures of million for moving costs and other costs related to personnel  relocation and recruiting and up to million of facility exit costs 
these estimated costs do not include an estimated million of non cash costs related to accelerated amortization and asset impairments 
included in the range of facility exit costs is an estimate of costs that may be incurred if we encounter delays in disposing of the grand junction facility  which we own  and the valencia facility  which we lease 
in addition to other significant operational and strategic improvements that we expect to achieve from our relocation project  we project that we should realize facilities and operating cost savings in excess of million per year beginning in  the first full year of planned operations in the charlotte area 
we also believe that south carolina will provide a favorable business climate  significant investment and tax benefits and a sustained lower cost of doing business 
we believe these savings should provide a substantial return on the anticipated investment in up front moving and other costs  and we expect them to translate into long term improvements in profitability 
except for the costs incurred in  all of the foregoing costs and anticipated savings relating to our relocation project are provided solely as estimates 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will not change as we proceed with this project  that actual expenditures will not differ from our estimates  or that anticipated savings and efficiencies will be realized 
the million of severance and restructuring costs that we incurred in arose from the following activities we accrued million of severance expenses during in connection with the outsourcing of our equipment assembly activities in grand junction  colorado  a personnel realignment in europe and certain other personnel changes in the united states 
we expended million of these severance expenses through december  and expended the remainder in during  we accrued an additional million of exit costs related to our office in austin  texas in order to fully provide for its estimated remaining exit costs 
in previous restructuring activities in  we had closed this office and accrued a portion of the exit costs from such facility for the remaining term of the underlying lease  which expires at the end of the unaccrued portion of these exit costs reflected a reduction in the exit costs arising from sublease rent that we estimated would be received for portions of the remaining term of such lease 
because that facility had not yet been subleased  we accrued an additional million of those exit costs during to fully provide for the estimated remaining exit costs 
we expect our cash outlays to implement this closure for to be in the range of million  and we expect to realize million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis from the closure of this facility  which savings should be realized in the future once the exit costs are paid 
substantially all of the restructuring costs that we accrued in connection with reductions in force in and prior years had been expended as of december   and those restructurings had been substantially completed as of that date 
in  we eliminated approximately positions from our workforce 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded million of severance expense in in connection with these reductions 
at december  and  our restructuring reserve for unexpended restructuring costs amounted to million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  income from operations as a result of our higher consolidated revenue and our higher gross profit  partially offset by our modestly higher operating costs and expenses discussed above  we recorded million of income from operations in  representing of consolidated revenue for as a result of our higher consolidated revenue and our higher gross profit margin  partially offset by our relatively lower operating costs and expenses discussed above  we recorded million of income from operations in  representing of consolidated revenue for on a geographic basis  we recorded operating income in the united states in  reversing us operating losses in and during  we adopted certain transfer pricing and other intercompany initiatives that contributed to our us operating income in and account for a substantial portion of the decline in operating profit outside of the us in depreciation and amortization declined to million in and million in from million in the decline in depreciation and amortization in and was primarily the result of reduced depreciation associated with lower levels of fixed assets and  to a lesser extent  the lower level of capital expenditures during each year 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  which consists primarily of interest income and interest expense  declined to million for as million of investment income from our continuing high level of cash and cash equivalents and higher interest rates for invested funds in partially offset million of interest expense from our million of outstanding debt 
we also benefited in from a million gain on the sale of certain assets and from the absence of million of annual interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated debentures  all of which were converted into common stock as of december  interest and other expense  net  decreased to million for from million in the decrease in was due primarily to the absence in of interest expense associated with borrowings under a credit facility that we repaid and terminated in the fourth quarter of and an increase in interest income arising from the short term investment of excess cash  partially offset by added interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated debentures that we issued in the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  provisions for benefit from income taxes we recorded a million benefit from income taxes in compared to a million provision for income taxes in both and our tax benefit arose primarily from a million reduction in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  which is discussed below  that more than offset a million provision for taxes in that arose primarily from foreign taxes 
our and tax provisions arose primarily from taxes on foreign operations 
as discussed below  in  we determined  based upon our then accumulated losses and our then continuing operating losses  that it was more likely than not that we would not be in a position to realize our deferred tax assets in future years 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance for these net deferred tax assets and reduced the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets to zero 
during  our gross deferred tax assets declined by million  primarily from the use of net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income  and our deferred tax liabilities declined by million  primarily related to the amortization of intangibles 
as a result  our total deferred tax assets and our valuation allowance declined by the net amount of million 
the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  our gross deferred tax assets declined by million  primarily from the reduction of accrued liabilities  reserves and allowances and capitalized patent costs included in our deferred tax assets and the use of net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income generated in our deferred tax liabilities declined by million  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles  partially offset by an increase in other deferred tax liabilities 
in addition  as discussed in greater detail below  we reversed million of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets was million at december  see critical accounting policies and significant estimates income taxes below and note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as discussed above  as of december   we changed our method of accounting for legal fees incurred in the defense of our patent and license rights and of amortizing one of our patent licenses 
we adopted such changes retroactively to january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as a result  for the year ended december   we recorded a cumulative effect of such changes in accounting principles of approximately million  net of applicable income tax effect  in addition to the million incremental increase in selling  general and administrative expenses mentioned above and a million increase in cost of sales 
net income and net income available to common stockholders we recorded million of net income for  a million increase over s level of million 
the principal reasons for the million increase in net income in were the million increase in operating income  our benefit from income taxes  due primarily to the million non cash reduction in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and the million reduction of interest and other expense  net  that were partially offset  with respect to net income available to common stockholders  by a million increase in dividends and accretion of issuance costs in with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
we recorded million of net income for compared to a net loss of million in the principal reasons that we reported net income in were our operating income in compared to an operating loss in  the decrease in interest and other expenses  net in  and the absence  in  of the million cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  that were partially offset  with respect to net income available to common stockholders  by a million increase in dividends and accretion of issuance costs in with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
net income available to common stockholders for was million after deducting accrued dividends and accretion of preferred stock issuance costs with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
on a per share basis  we recorded of basic income per share available to the common stockholders in after taking into account the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options  diluted income per share available to the common stockholders was in net income available to common stockholders for was million  after giving effect to million of dividends and accretion of preferred stock issuance costs with respect to our series b convertible preferred stock 
on a per share basis  basic income per share available to the common stockholders in was 
after taking into account the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options  fully diluted income per share was in the dilutive effects of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures and series b convertible preferred stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share in and as they would have been anti dilutive  that is  they would have increased income per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in  our net loss available to common stockholders was million or per share of common stock basic and diluted 
excluding the million cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  net loss available to common stockholders was million or per share of common stock 
these net losses in also included the preferred stock dividends mentioned above  including accretion of preferred stock issuance costs 
in december  we paid million in dividends to the holders of the series b convertible preferred stock 
on a per common share basis  the effect of such dividends on the common stockholders was to increase the loss per share available to common stockholders in by per share 
liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended december   our principal sources of liquidity have migrated from reliance on external financing transactions to reliance on cash provided by net income and other operating activities before changes in operating accounts 
in and  we also benefited from proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents that arose from external financing transactions in that year 
our unrestricted cash increased by million to million at december  due primarily to the million of cash generated in our operations in and the million of cash provided by financing activities  which were partially offset by million of cash used in investing activities 
unrestricted cash declined by million to million in as investments in working capital  including accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets  and investing activities to support our growth more than offset our million of net income and the million of cash we generated from financing activities  most of which was derived from stock option exercises 
we also benefited  particularly in  from the effect of the strengthening us dollar on our cash 
working capital our net working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from an million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in inventories  net  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  million arising from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  which is discussed above  and a million decline in accrued liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in customer deposits  and a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in accounts receivable  net is related primarily to receivables arising from the timing of sales made in the latter part of the fourth quarter of receivable days sales outstanding increased to days at december  compared to days at december  primarily reflecting the timing of sales 
accounts receivable more than days past due were of receivables at december  and of receivables at december  the components of inventories were as follows table year ended december  dollars in thousands raw materials inventory held by assemblers work in process finished goods total the higher level of inventory at december  arose from million of higher finished goods inventory incurred to support our higher level of sales  partially offset by declines in raw materials inventory  inventory held by our third party outsource assemblers and work in process 
our raw materials and work in process inventory declined from december  to december  primarily due to our third party assemblers having taken over supply chain responsibilities for the assembly of those systems 
the million increase in inventory shown in table and on the consolidated balance sheets resulted from the cash flow related million increase in net inventory set forth on the consolidated statement of cash flows partially offset by i the million reduction in our inventory reserves  ii a net million non cash decrease resulting from inventory transferred to fixed assets and iii a negative million effect arising from foreign currency translation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the million reduction in our inventory reserves was primarily due to write offs of previously reserved inventory  a change in estimate related to spare parts inventory and an asset sale of inventory 
in connection with the outsourcing activities that we have entered into with our third party assemblers  we sold to them components of our raw materials inventory related to those systems 
we recorded those sales in our financial statements as a product financing arrangement under sfas no 
 accounting for product financing arrangements 
at december   million of the inventory sold to assemblers remained in inventory  and we had a corresponding accrued liability representing our non contractual obligation to repurchase assembled systems and refurbished parts produced from such inventory 
at december   inventory held by assemblers and our corresponding accrued liability had declined to million 
our prepaid expenses and other current assets also include amounts attributable to our arrangements with our outsource suppliers  which amounts affect our working capital 
the components of prepaid expenses and other current assets were as follows in thousands of dollars table year ended december  progress payments to assemblers non trade receivables other total the non trade receivables shown in table together with inventory held by assemblers shown in table  and a related accrued liability in an amount that corresponds to the book value of inventory held by assemblers included in accrued liabilities on our balance sheet relate to the accounting for our outsourcing arrangements pursuant to sfas no 
at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets a million non trade receivable from certain of the equipment assemblers that we engaged to assemble our invision d printing equipment  our viper sla systems and certain other equipment items  to refurbish used equipment systems and to assemble field service kits for sale by us to our customers 
the amount of this non trade receivable initially reflected the book value of the inventory sold to the assemblers 
the amount of that non trade receivable had decreased to million at december  as a result of payments made to us for the inventory sold to them 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we expect the assemblers to repay the balance of this non trade receivable to us 
under our arrangements with our third party assemblers  we generally purchase assembled systems from them following our receipt of an order from a customer or as needed to repair a component or to service equipment 
under certain circumstances  we anticipate that we may purchase assembled systems from the assemblers prior to the receipt of an order from a customer 
at december   we had made million of progress payments to assemblers for systems forecasted to be required for resale to customers after december  compared to million of progress payments at december  the increase in progress payments during primarily reflects the ramp up in production for our newly introduced systems  including our sinterstation pro sls and our viper pro sla systems 
the million decline in accrued liabilities at december  included a million decline attributable to the decline in inventory held by assemblers  and the balance of such decline related to changes in accrued liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the million of vendor accruals included in accrued liabilities related to either goods that we had received but not been invoiced for at december  or goods for which we had received an invoice but not the related goods 
the million increase in customer deposits related primarily to advance payments for systems ordered by customers 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the use of a total of million of cash in operating and investing activities in  which was partially offset by the net effect of the cash provided by financing activities and by the effect of exchange rate changes on cash  which are discussed below 
the changes in from the items of working capital not discussed above arose in the ordinary course of business 
differences not discussed above between the amounts of working capital item changes in the cash flow statement and the amount of balance sheet changes for those items are primarily the result of foreign currency translation adjustments 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rates below

we generated million of cash from our million of net income and million of non cash expense for depreciation and amortization that was more than offset by million of reconciling items  including the million reduction in our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  a million adjustment to our inventory reserves and million of gains on the disposition of property and equipment  partially offset by million of stock based compensation expense  and million of cash used in changes in operating accounts 
the principal changes in operating accounts  the reasons for which are discussed above  were million of cash used for additions to accounts receivable  million of cash used for additions to inventories  and million of cash used for additions to prepaid expenses and other current assets  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  and million of customer deposits and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  which resulted from our million of net income and the combined million net effect of non cash depreciation and amortization and changes in operating accounts in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million as substantially all of our net loss of million was offset by changes in non cash expenses and in operating accounts 
the changes in the operating accounts arose in the ordinary course of business 
non cash items included a million charge for the cumulative effect through december  of the changes in accounting principles discussed above  an million impairment for intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of optoform sarl  which we recorded at december   million of depreciation and amortization  million of adjustments to allowance accounts  and million of equity compensation expense 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in increased to million 
investing activities in consisted principally of costs of acquiring and implementing our new enterprise wide software system and computer hardware upgrades  other purchases of property and equipment  additions to licenses and patents and software development costs 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures in to be in the range of million to million  primarily for information technology systems and hardware and for capital expenditures related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to rock hill  south carolina 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures during related to our relocation will be in the range of million  which does not include the developer s cost for construction of the new facility that we have agreed to lease 
net cash used in investing activities in was million 
investing activities in consisted principally of purchases of property and equipment  additions to licenses and patents and software development costs 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  reflecting a reduced level of capital expenditures and the absence of capitalized patent legal defense costs relating to the change in accounting principle with respect to such costs that is discussed above 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in increased to million 
the principal source of cash from financing activities in was million received primarily from the exercise of stock options 
as was the case in  cash was used to pay preferred stock dividends  to make the semi annual repayments required to be made in under our industrial development bonds and to pay certain other obligations that came due during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the principal source of cash from financing activities in was million received primarily from the exercise of stock options 
cash was used to pay preferred stock dividends  to pay liquidated damages and stock registration costs related to registration of previously issued securities  to make the semi annual repayments required to be made in under our industrial development bonds and to pay certain other obligations that came due during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
the principal sources of cash from such activities in were million of net proceeds arising from the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock and our convertible subordinated debentures 
we used million of cash to repay outstanding bank debt outstanding 
as a result  we had repaid all of our previously outstanding bank debt as of december  outstanding debt our outstanding debt at december  and was as follows table dollars in thousands line of credit industrial development revenue bonds current portion of long term debt long term debt  less current portion total subordinated debt convertible subordinated debentures total debt at december   the carrying value of our total debt had declined to million from million at december  our fixed rate debt was million at december  and million at december  the principal reasons for the decline in the carrying value of our total debt at december  were the making of the million of principal payments due during on our floating rate industrial development bonds and the conversion of million of our convertible debt into common stock 
as discussed below  no borrowings were outstanding under our line of credit at december  or december  silicon valley bank loan and security agreement we maintain a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank that is scheduled to expire on july  this credit facility  as amended  provides that we and certain of our subsidiaries may borrow up to million of revolving loans and includes sub limits for letter of credit and foreign exchange facilities 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien in favor of silicon valley bank on certain of our assets  including domestic accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
interest accrues on outstanding borrowings at either the bank s prime rate in effect from time to time or at a libor rate plus 
we are obligated to pay  on a quarterly basis  a commitment fee equal to per annum of the unused amount of the facility 
the facility  as amended  imposes certain limitations on our activities  including limitations on the incurrence of debt and other liens  limitations on the disposition of assets  limitations on the making of certain investments and limitations on the payment of dividends on our common stock 
the facility also requires us to maintain a a quick ratio as defined in the credit facility of at least to as of june  and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter  b a ratio of total liabilities less subordinated debt to tangible net worth as each such term is defined in the credit facility of not more than to as of december  and at the end of each calendar quarter thereafter  and c on a trailing four quarter basis  ebitda as defined in the credit facility in an amount not less than million for each period ending on or after december  we were in compliance with these requirements at december  and with the financial covenants that applied to this facility at december  at december  and  respectively  we had million and million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with silicon valley bank 
no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility at december  or  and we do not currently expect to borrow under this credit facility due to our current cash position and our currently anticipated future cash flow 
however  we expect this credit facility to provide us with additional liquidity as we grow and that the credit facility will allow us to better manage our foreign exchange exposure 
industrial development bonds our grand junction  colorado facility was financed by industrial development bonds in the original aggregate principal amount of million 
at december   the outstanding principal amount of these bonds was million 
interest on the bonds accrues at a variable rate of interest and is payable monthly 
the interest rate at december  was 
principal payments are due in semi annual installments through august we have made all required payments of principal and interest on these bonds 
the bonds are collateralized by  among other things  a first mortgage on the facility  a security interest in certain equipment and an irrevocable letter of credit issued by wells fargo bank  na pursuant to the terms of a reimbursement agreement between us and wells fargo 
we are required to pay an annual letter of credit fee equal to of the stated amount of the letter of credit 
this letter of credit is in turn collateralized by million of restricted cash that wells fargo holds 
effective november   we entered into an amendment to the reimbursement agreement with wells fargo pursuant to which such funds will be held in an interest bearing account at wells fargo  and wells fargo will have a security interest in that account as partial security for the performance of our obligations under the reimbursement agreement 
under that amendment  we also have the right to substitute a standby letter of credit issued by a bank acceptable to wells fargo as collateral in place of the funds held in that account 
the reimbursement agreement  as amended  contains financial covenants that require  among other things  that we maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the reimbursement agreement of million plus of net income from july  forward and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the reimbursement agreement of no less than 
we are required to demonstrate our compliance with these financial covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter 
as of december  and december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the november amendment to the reimbursement agreement also deleted provisions of a previous amendment to the reimbursement agreement that we entered into on march  that provided that a we acknowledged that  upon the occurrence of any future event of default under the reimbursement agreement  wells fargo would not consider waiving such event of default unless and until we comply with all requirements imposed by wells fargo  which would include but not be limited to the immediate retirement of million of the industrial development bonds  b that funds for such repayment would come first from our restricted cash then held by wells fargo  if any  and the balance from additional funds to be provided by us to the trustee of such bonds promptly upon notice from wells fargo  and c that any event of default would result in an increase to the letter of credit fee from of the stated amount of the letter of credit to of the stated amount of the letter of credit prorated from the occurrence of such event of default until the next august  when the fee is due  and continuing for the life of the letter of credit 
as discussed above  we plan to close the grand junction facility during the second quarter of and subsequently to sell it 
at the time we sell the facility  we expect to either pay off these bonds or  with the approval of wells fargo  have them assumed by a qualified buyer 
convertible subordinated debentures the convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at the rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year 
they are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity at per share  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments

the conditions to our obligation to file such registration statement have not yet been satisfied  and no such registration statement is currently pending 
commitments and contingencies we lease certain facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring through the leases are generally on a net rent basis  under which we pay taxes  maintenance and insurance 
leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties

as discussed above  on february   we entered into a lease agreement with kdc carolina investments  lp pursuant to which kdc will construct an approximately  square foot building on a parcel of land in rock hill  south carolina  according to our specifications and lease it to us once it is completed 
the term of this lease will commence on the later to occur of august  and the date construction of the leased premises is substantially completed and will expire on the fifteenth anniversary of the last day of the month in which the commencement date occurs 
the lease is a triple net lease and provides for the payment of base rent of approximately million in its first year  million in each of years two through five  million in each of years six through ten and million in each of years eleven through fifteen 
we intend to account for this lease as an operating lease 
upon the completion of the leased premises  base rent is subject to adjustment based upon the final cost of the leased premises and certain other factors described in the lease 
such adjustment may result in either an upward or downward adjustment of base rent 
under the terms of the lease  we will be obligated to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other operating costs with respect to the leased premises

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when we consider it to be appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and our outstanding industrial development bonds 
we seek to minimize the risk to our cash investments by investing cash in excess of our operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly creditworthy financial institutions  corporations or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  we may use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  collars or options  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  we had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and preferred stock varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for our common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into shares of our common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by our stock price and stock volatility 
the estimated fair value of our total debt and preferred stock declined to approximately million at december  from million at december  this value includes  with respect to our fixed rate convertible securities  the cost of replacing these securities with borrowings at current rates and comparable maturities on the assumption that these securities will remain outstanding until their mandatory redemption dates 
the fair value of our fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model is intended to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  the market price of our common stock and an estimate of the volatility of our common stock 
such changes in the fair value of our fixed rate instruments do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of our outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the change in estimated fair value of our fixed rate instruments outstanding at december  was predominantly the result of a change from to in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  a decrease in the year end market price of our common stock into which the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a million change in the estimated fair value of our debt at december  foreign exchange rates we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
more than of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales outside of the us see business global operations above 
this revenue is generated primarily from the operations of our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas and is primarily denominated in each subsidiary s local functional currency although certain sales are denominated in other currencies  including us dollars or the euro  rather than the local functional currency 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the euro  pound sterling  swiss franc and japanese yen 
the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  our foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
our operating results as well as our assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation when the operating results  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated statements of operations include million of loss in compared to million of gain in and million of loss in arising from the realized effect of foreign currency related items 
the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in a million loss that was recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income  compared to a million gain in and a million gain in at december   a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would cause a million change to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and a million change in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we and our subsidiaries conduct business in various countries using both our functional currencies and other currencies to effect cross border transactions 
as a result  we and our subsidiaries are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dates that those transactions are entered into and their respective settlement dates will result in a foreign exchange gain or loss 
when practicable  we endeavor to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on our balance sheet and those of our subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks 
we also  when we consider it to be appropriate  enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions 
at december   those contracts included both the purchase and sale of currencies other than the us dollar 
the purchase contracts related primarily to the procurement of inventory from a third party denominated in swiss francs 
the foreign currency sales contracts were denominated in euros  pound sterling and japanese yen and were entered into to hedge intercompany purchase obligations of our subsidiaries 
at december   these contracts included only the purchase of currencies other than the us dollar 
during  we entered into a range forward arrangement with a large  creditworthy financial institution to hedge certain other currency rate exposures in japanese yen 
this arrangement established a collar around a range of exchange rates between and yen to the us dollar to hedge million yen approximate equivalent range of million to million of inter company payments from our japanese subsidiary 
both the put and call options entered into under this hedge arrangement were for the same monetary amount and maturity date 
this range forward arrangement expired on february  the dollar equivalent of the foreign currency contracts and related fair values as of december  and were as follows table foreign currency option contracts foreign currency purchase contracts foreign currency sales contracts notional amount fair value net unrealized gain loss the net fair value of all foreign exchange contracts at december  and reflected unrealized gains losses of and  respectively 
these foreign currency contracts expire at various times between january  and april  the company has not adopted hedge accounting  and all gains and losses realized or unrealized are recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
as noted above  we may use derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency options  to fix or limit our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income or loss 
commodity prices we use various commodity raw materials and energy products in conjunction with our manufacturing processes 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components 
at december   a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a million change to cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition set forth in this annual report on form k is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make critical accounting estimates that directly impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  contingencies and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following represent what we believe to be the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of systems and related products and materials is recognized upon shipment or when services are performed  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists upon execution of a written sales agreement that constitutes a fixed and legally binding commitment between us and the buyer 
sales of our systems generally include equipment  a software license  a warranty on the equipment  training  and installation 
we allocate and record revenue in these transactions based on vendor specific objective evidence that has been accumulated through historic operations  which  in most cases  is the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately 
if fair value for all deliverables cannot be determined  we will use the residual method to determine the amount of the consideration to be allocated to the delivered items 
we also evaluate the impact of undelivered items on the functionality of delivered items for each sales transaction and  where appropriate  defer revenue on delivered items when that functionality has been affected 
functionality is determined to be met if the delivered products or services represent a separate earnings process 
revenue from services is recognized at the time of performance 
we provide end users with maintenance under a warranty agreement for up to one year and defer a portion of the revenue from the related systems sale at the time of sale based on the relative fair value of those services 
after the initial warranty period  we offer these customers optional maintenance contracts 
deferred maintenance revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the period of the contract 
our systems are sold with licensed software products that are integral to the operation of the systems 
these software products are generally sold or licensed only for use in our systems 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers for equipment sales are included in product revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
costs we incur that are associated with shipping and handling are included in product cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
credit is extended  and creditworthiness is determined  based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
new customers are generally required to complete a credit application and provide references and bank information to facilitate an analysis of creditworthiness 
customers with a favorable profile may receive credit terms based on that profile that differ from our general credit terms 
creditworthiness is considered  among other things  in evaluating our relationship with customers with past due balances 
our terms of sale generally require payment within to days after shipment of a product although we also recognize that longer payment periods are customary in some countries in which we transact business 
to reduce credit risk in connection with systems sales  we may  depending upon the circumstances  require significant deposits prior to shipment and may retain a security interest in a system sold until fully paid 
in some circumstances  we may require payment in full for our products prior to shipment and may require international customers to furnish letters of credit 
for services  we either bill customers on a time and materials basis or sell customers service agreements that are recorded as deferred revenue and provide for payment in advance on either an annual or other periodic basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet our financial obligations for example  aging over days past due or bankruptcy 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change for example  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimate of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of recognizing additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
income taxes we and our domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return 
our non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
we provide for income taxes on those portions of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated earnings that we believe are not reinvested indefinitely in their business 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
we record deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences between recorded net income and taxable net income when and if we believe that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the tax benefit 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas no 
provides that an important factor in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is whether there has been sufficient income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
based upon our accumulated losses and our then continuing operating losses for years prior to  we established and maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   our accumulated valuation allowance was million  which together with our deferred tax liabilities at that time reduced the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets to zero 
at december   our valuation allowance declined by million to million as we used million of our deferred tax assets in to offset taxable income for the deferred tax assets used for this purpose in were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards used to offset taxable income  partially offset by a million decline in our deferred tax liabilities primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles 
during  our gross deferred tax assets declined by million  primarily from the reduction of accrued liabilities  reserves and allowances and capitalized patent costs included in our deferred tax assets and the use of net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income 
our deferred tax liabilities declined by million in  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles  partially offset by an increase in other deferred tax liabilities  and our gross deferred tax assets accordingly declined to million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in addition  at december   we performed an analysis pursuant to sfas no 
to determine whether  in light of the improvement in our operations  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will be able to be utilized 
in performing this analysis  we considered  among other things  the amount of our taxable income in and and whether we have a basis to expect sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our deferred tax assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that it is more likely than not that we would be able to utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets attributable to united states taxable income in  and we accordingly reversed million of our valuation allowance  recognized a corresponding benefit against our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the million net deferred tax asset arising from this reversal appears as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this reversal and the other changes to our deferred tax assets and liabilities during  at december  our valuation allowance declined to million 
we believe that our estimate of deferred tax assets and our maintenance of a valuation allowance against such assets are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of our valuation allowance may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
we intend to continue to assess our valuation allowance in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to the fact that we have operations in numerous tax jurisdictions outside the united states that are subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
our inventory reserve was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million reduction in our inventory reserves in was primarily due to write offs of previously reserved inventory  a change in estimate related and spare parts inventory and an asset sale of inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
our determination of the allowance for inventory reserves is subject to change because it is based on management s current estimates of required reserves and potential adjustments 
we believe that the allowance for inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur and because the impact of recognizing additional obsolescence reserves may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and in our results of operations 
goodwill and intangible and other long lived assets the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to use our judgment and could require us to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as required by sfas no 
 we have allocated goodwill to identifiable reporting units  which are tested for impairment using a two step process detailed in the statement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  goodwill set forth on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  arose from acquisitions carried out in years prior to december  goodwill arising from the acquisition of dtm corporation in was allocated to reporting units based on the percentage of sls systems then installed by geographic area 
goodwill arising from other acquisitions was allocated to reporting units based on geographic dispersion of the acquired companies sales at the time of their acquisition 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
if that fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the second step of the process is not required to be performed  and no impairment charge is required to be recorded 
if that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount  companies must perform the second step that requires an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a purchase business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price 
the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation is then compared to the carrying amount with any excess recorded as an impairment charge 
pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 we are required to perform a valuation of our reporting units annually  or upon significant changes in our business environment 
we have performed an evaluation of our reporting units for each year that sfas no 
has been in effect  including the years ended december   and and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment adjustments were recorded for these years for goodwill recorded in our statements of operations or on our consolidated balance sheets for those years 
we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
at december   we determined that an impairment of the acquired technology and other long lived assets arising from the acquisition of optoform sarl had occurred as it had become unlikely that the technology would be commercialized 
accordingly  future cash flows from these assets were expected to be negligible 
we recorded the estimated impairment amount of million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we believe that our determination whether or not to recognize an impairment of goodwill or of intangible assets or other long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change  dependent upon estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  and because the impact of recognizing an impairment may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and to our results of operations 
contingencies we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting january  compensation expense for new equity awards  in most cases  will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we and other issuers will begin to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the fair value of those awards on their respective grant dates 
for periods before the required effective date for which financial statements have not yet been issued  we had the option to elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required by statement no 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  and began to expense previously issued equity awards for which service has not been rendered on that date 
as of december   we estimate our maximum expense for existing stock options to be approximately million  which would be recognized million for and million for this projected expense will change if any stock options are granted  which we do not currently expect to occur  or cancelled prior to the respective reporting periods or if there are any changes required to be made for estimated forfeitures as of january  as of december   we estimate our maximum expense for outstanding restricted stock awards to be approximately million  which would be recognized million for  million for  million for and million for this projected expense will change if any restricted stock awards are granted  which we expect to occur  or repurchased prior to vesting in any of the respective reporting periods 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle and guidance for retrospective application of a change in accounting principle 
the statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the statement carries forward  without change  the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
for reporting the correction of errors in previously issued financial statements and changes in accounting estimates 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and we do not expect it to be material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
in addition to statements that explicitly describe such risks and uncertainties  readers are urged to consider statements in future or conditional tenses or that include terms such as believes  belief  expects  intends  anticipates or plans to be uncertain and forward looking 
forward looking statements may include comments as to our beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting our business 
forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations concerning future events and trends and are necessarily subject to uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control 
the factors stated under the heading cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below  as well as other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected or predicted in forward looking statements 
any forward looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  using information currently available to us 
we assume no obligation  and do not intend  to update these forward looking statements 
if one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize  or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those reflected in or suggested by forward looking statements 
any forward looking statement you read in this annual report on form k reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations  results of operations  growth strategy and liquidity 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph 
you should specifically consider the factors identified in this annual report on form k which would cause actual results to differ from those referred to in forward looking statements 
cautionary statements and risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in that event the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
we face risks in connection with our announced plans to relocate our corporate headquarters and principal r d facilities to rock hill  south carolina 
these risks include the possibility that we may face delays in the construction and occupancy of our new facility 
the risk that the cost of that facility may exceed our plans and expectations 
the risk that we may lose employees who are important to our business 
the risk that the costs that we expect to incur may materially and adversely change as we proceed with this project 
the risk that the anticipated savings that we expect to realize from this project will not be realized 
the risk that we will not be successful in exiting from the valencia  california and grand junction  colorado facilities on advantageous terms 
we face risks in connection with our current project to install a new enterprise resource system for our business 
these risks include the risk that we may face delays in the design and implementation of that system 
the risk that the cost of that system may exceed our plans and expectations 
the risk that such system may damage our ability to process transactions or harm our control environment 
the mix of products that we sell could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our gross margins  and those fluctuations in margins could cause fluctuations in net income or net loss 
we continuously work to expand and improve our product offerings  including our systems  materials and services  the number of geographic areas in which we operate and the distribution channels we use to reach various target product applications and customers 
this variety of products  applications and channels results in a range of gross margins and operating income that can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter 
we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross margins or net income due to the impact of the mix of products  channels or geographic areas in which we sell our products from period to period 
we may be subject to product liability claims  which could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite testing  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers 
this could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
we attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products 
however  the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer  and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention  damage to our business reputation and cause us to fail to retain existing customers or to fail to attract new customers 
we face significant competition in many aspects of our business  which could cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
the competition in our industry could cause us to reduce sales prices or incur additional marketing or production costs  which could result in decreased revenue  increased costs and reduced margins 
we compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment for models  prototypes and other three dimensional objects as well as producers of materials and services for this equipment 
some of our existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment  materials and services 
many of these competitors have financial  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those of ours 
we also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents  from the issuance of patents to other companies that inhibit our ability to develop certain products and from the improvement to existing materials and equipment technologies 
we intend to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
if we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products  we may lose revenue and demand for our products 
we are affected by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices  any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we believe that our future success may depend on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs 
we believe that to remain competitive we must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
therefore  we believe that our success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop or obtain leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing products  develop new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  particularly in the area of materials functionality  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  and recruit and retain key technology employees 
we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for components and sub assemblies used in our systems and raw materials used in our materials 
if these relationships were to terminate  our business could be disrupted while we locate an alternative supplier and our expenses may increase 
as discussed above  we purchase components and sub assemblies for our systems and purchase raw materials that are used in our materials from third party suppliers 
while there are several potential suppliers of the material components  parts and subassemblies for our products  we currently choose to use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these components  including our lasers  materials and certain jetting components 
our reliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves many risks including potential shortages of some key components  product performance shortfalls  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capabilities  quality and costs 
if any of our suppliers suffers business disruptions or financial difficulties  or if there is any significant change in the condition of our relationship with the supplier  our cost of goods sold may increase and we may be unable quickly to obtain these components from alternative sources 
while we believe that we can obtain all of the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers  we require any new supplier to become qualified pursuant to our internal procedures  which could involve a day to day process 
we generally have our systems assembled based on our internal forecasts 
any unanticipated change in the source of our supplies  or unanticipated supply limitations  could increase production or related costs and consequently reduce margins 
in addition  certain of our components require an order lead time of three months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become more difficult to obtain in the future 
we may experience delays in the receipt of some components 
to meet forecasted production levels  we may be required to commit to long lead times for delivery from suppliers prior to receiving orders for our products 
if our forecasts exceed actual orders  we may hold large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow  profitability and results of operations 
we face risks in connection with the outsourcing of the assembly of our equipment models to selected design and manufacturing companies 
beginning in july  we engaged selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble our equipment portfolio  including our invision d printers and our sla and sls systems 
in carrying out these outsourcing activities  we face a number of risks  including the risk that the parties that we identify and retain to perform assembly activities may not perform in a satisfactory manner 
the risk of disruption in the supply of systems to our customers if such third parties either fail to perform in a satisfactory manner or are unable to supply us with the quantity of systems that are needed to meet then current customer demand 
the risk that we face  as discussed above  in dealing with a limited number of suppliers 
our operating results vary from quarter to quarter  which could impact our stock price 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
in some quarters  it is possible that results could be below expectations of analysts and investors 
if so  the price of our common stock may decline 
many factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
these factors include acceptance and reliability of new products in the marketplace  size and timing of product shipments  fluctuations in the costs of materials and parts  currency and economic fluctuations in foreign markets and other factors affecting international sales  price competition  delays in the introduction of new products  general worldwide economic conditions  changes in the mix of products and services sold  impact of ongoing litigation  and impact of changing technologies 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures and series b convertible preferred stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options could dilute your ownership and negatively impact the market price for our common stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issuable as of december  upon the conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of outstanding stock options as follows our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible at any time into approximately million shares of common stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible at any time into approximately million shares of common stock 
approximately million shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options  million of which options were currently exercisable at december  to the extent that all of our subordinated debentures and the series b convertible preferred stock are converted or our outstanding stock options are exercised  a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock will be outstanding  and the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted 
at the same time  any conversions of such convertible securities  such as the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures at the end of  correspondingly would reduce our subordinated debt and preferred stock obligations 
moreover  future sales of substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we face risks associated with conducting business outside of the us  and  if we do not manage these risks  our costs may increase  our revenue from non us operations may decline  and we may suffer other adverse effects to our results of operations and financial condition 
more than of our revenue is derived from customers in countries outside of the us there are many risks inherent in business activities outside of the us that  unless managed properly  may adversely affect our profitability  including our ability to collect amounts due from customers 
our non us operations could be adversely affected by unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls  tariffs and other barriers  social and political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  taxation  terrorism  and other factors  depending upon the specific country in which we conduct business 
political and economic events and the uncertainty resulting from them may have a material adverse effect on our market opportunities and operating results 
the us military campaigns against terrorism in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere and continued violence in the middle east and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and revenue 
as a result of these uncertainties  spending on capital equipment of the type that we sell may be weaker than spending in the economy as a whole 
these uncertainties may also lead our customers in certain industries to delay not only purchases of equipment and systems but also the materials and services that we sell as well 
the long term effects of these uncertainties on our customers  the trading price for our common stock  the market for our services and the us economy as a whole are uncertain 
the consequences of any additional terrorist attacks or of any expanded armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenue or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by investors and securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
historically  our common stock has been characterized by generally low daily trading volume  and our common stock price has been volatile 
the price of our common stock ranged from to during factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include the perceived value of our company in the securities markets  future announcements concerning developments affecting our business or those of our competitors  including the receipt or loss of substantial orders for products  overall trends in the stock market  the impact of changes in our results of operations  our financial condition or our prospects on how we are perceived in the securities markets  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  and sales or purchases of substantial blocks of stock 
our debt level could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to run our business 
as of december  and  our outstanding debt amounted to million and million  respectively 
this debt included principally our convertible subordinated debentures that are due in and the industrial development bonds covering our colorado facility that are due in annual installments through we also have outstanding approximately million shares of series b convertible preferred stock that is required to be redeemed in at a liquidation value of million excluding accrued and unpaid dividends 
this level of debt and preferred stock could have important consequences to you as a holder of common stock 
we have identified below some of the material potential consequences resulting from this significant amount of debt and preferred stock we could be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
our ability to adapt to changing market conditions could be hampered  and we could be more vulnerable in a volatile market and at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 
our operating flexibility could be limited by restrictive covenants contained in credit documents such as restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on properties  making acquisitions and paying dividends and requirements that we satisfy certain financial covenants such as the maintenance of certain levels of net worth  interest coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios or other financial covenants 
we could be subject to the risks that interest rates  interest expense and fixed charges will increase 
our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business may be more limited 
our operating results may be insufficient to achieve compliance with financial covenants in financing documents  thereby causing acceleration of outstanding debt 
if we were unable to generate net cash flow from operations or if we were unable to raise additional capital  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
as discussed above  was the first year since that we generated income from operations  and  in the period from late through  we depended heavily on external financings to provide us with cash to support our operations 
even if the favorable trend in our operations that we have experienced in and continues  we cannot assure you that we would generate funds from operations or that capital would be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to fund future operating costs  debt service obligations and capital requirements 
the lack of additional capital resulting from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations and would  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
further  we cannot assure you that any necessary funds  if available  would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders 
if our financial condition worsens and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or other strategic transactions  we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy 
our balance sheet contains several categories of intangible assets totaling million that we could be required to write off or write down in the event of the impairment of certain of those assets and our future performance  which could adversely impact our future earnings and stock price  our ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our customer relationships 
as of december   we had million of unamortized intangible assets  consisting of licenses  patents  acquired technology and other intangibles that we amortize over time 
any material impairment to any of these items could reduce our net income and could affect the trading price of our common stock 
at december   we had million in goodwill capitalized on our balance sheet 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over the fair value of the underlying asset 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets are tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant  and such testing could result in write downs of some of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
accordingly  we may  from time to time  incur impairment charges  which are recorded as operating expenses when they are incurred and would reduce our net income and adversely affect our operating results 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and significant estimates goodwill and intangible and other long lived assets 
laws that inhibit takeovers may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
various provisions of delaware law may inhibit changes in control not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover 
one of these delaware laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder as defined in the statute for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  of which approximately million shares are outstanding as series b convertible preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to determine the issue price  rights  preferences and privileges of series of preferred stock without in most cases any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
our ability to issue preferred stock gives us flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financings  but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  any preferred stock that is issued may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when we consider it to be appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and our outstanding industrial development bonds 
we seek to minimize the risk to our cash investments by investing cash in excess of our operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly creditworthy financial institutions  corporations or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  we may use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  collars or options  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  we had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and preferred stock varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for our common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into shares of our common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by our stock price and stock volatility 
at december   the carrying value of our total debt had declined to million from million at december  our fixed rate debt was million at december  and million at december  the principal reasons for the decline in the carrying value of our total debt at december  were the making of the million of principal payments due during on our floating rate industrial development bonds and the conversion of million of our convertible debt into common stock 
the carrying value of our series b convertible preferred stock was million at december  and million at december  the estimated fair value of our total debt and preferred stock declined to million at december  from million at december  this value includes  with respect to our fixed rate convertible securities  the cost of replacing these securities with borrowings at current rates and comparable maturities on the assumption that these securities will remain outstanding until their mandatory redemption dates 
the fair value of our fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model is intended to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  the market price of our common stock and an estimate of the volatility of our common stock 
such changes in the fair value of our fixed rate instruments do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of our outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the change in estimated fair value of our fixed rate instruments outstanding at december  was predominantly the result of a change from to in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  a decrease in the year end market price of our common stock into which the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a million change in the estimated fair value of our debt at december  foreign exchange rates we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
more than of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales outside of the us this revenue is generated primarily from the operations of our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas and is primarily denominated in each subsidiary s local functional currency although certain sales are denominated in other currencies  including us dollars or the euro  rather than the local functional currency 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the euro  pound sterling  swiss franc and japanese yen 
the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
our operating results as well as our assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation when the operating results  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of foreign currency related items on our consolidated statements of operations resulted in a million loss in compared to a million gain in and a million loss in the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in a million loss that was recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income  compared to a million gain in and a million gain in at december   a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would cause a million change to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and a million change in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we and our subsidiaries conduct business in various countries using both our functional currencies and other currencies to effect cross border transactions 
as a result  we and our subsidiaries are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the dates that those transactions are entered into and their respective settlement dates will result in a foreign exchange gain or loss 
when practicable  we endeavor to match assets and liabilities in the same currency on our balance sheet and those of our subsidiaries in order to reduce these risks 
we also  when we consider it to be appropriate  enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposures arising from those transactions 
at december   those contracts included both the purchase and sale of currencies other than the us dollar 
the purchase contracts related primarily to the procurement of inventory from a third party denominated in swiss francs 
the foreign currency sales contracts were denominated in euros  pound sterling and japanese yen and were entered into to hedge intercompany purchase obligations of our subsidiaries 
at december   these contracts included only the purchase of currencies other than the us dollar 
during  we entered into a range forward arrangement with a large  creditworthy financial institution to hedge certain other currency rate exposures in japanese yen 
this arrangement established a collar around a range of exchange rates between and yen to the us dollar to hedge million yen approximate equivalent range of million to million of inter company payments from our japanese subsidiary 
both the put and call options entered into under this hedge arrangement were for the same monetary amount and maturity date 
this range forward arrangement expired on february  the dollar equivalent of the foreign currency contracts and related fair values as of december  and were as follows table foreign currency option contracts foreign currency purchase contracts foreign currency sales contracts notional amount fair value net unrealized gain loss the net fair value of all foreign exchange contracts at december  and reflected unrealized gains losses of and  respectively 
these foreign currency contracts expire at various times between january  and april  the company has not adopted hedge accounting  and all gains and losses realized or unrealized are recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
as noted above  we may use derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency options  to fix or limit our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income or loss 
commodity prices we use various commodity raw materials and energy products in conjunction with our manufacturing processes 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components 
at december   a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a million change to cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations
