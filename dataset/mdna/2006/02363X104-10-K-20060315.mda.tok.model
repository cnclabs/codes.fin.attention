ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition of ffo that is recommended by the national association of real investment trusts nareit 
to calculate ffo under the nareit definition  depreciation and amortization expenses related to the company s real estate  gains or losses realized from the disposition of depreciable real estate assets  and certain extraordinary items are added back to the company s net income 
ffo in and was negatively affected by million and million of costs associated with the conversion of the company to a self advised and self managed reit 
although these costs are required to be included within ffo  these types of expenses will not likely re occur and the transactions which created these costs are expected to be accretive to ffo in future periods 

table of contents the company believes that ffo is useful in assessing the company s operating performance because ffo excludes the depreciation expense on real estate assets and real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets such as machinery or equipment 
additionally  other real estate companies  analysts and investors utilize ffo in analyzing the results of real estate companies 
while the company uses the nareit definition of ffo  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits or real estate companies with similar assets 
this is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on ffo 
real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time whereas real estate costs that are expensed are accounted for as a current period expense 
this affects ffo because costs that are accounted for as expenses reduce ffo 
conversely  real estate costs that are capitalized and depreciated are added back to net income to calculate ffo 
see the funds from operations caption included within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a reconciliation of ffo to net income  which is calculated in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this report including  but not limited to  the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  the company s performance and financial results 
all statements  trend analysis and other information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the company and the real estate investments it has made constitute forward looking statements 
shareholders and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and a number of factors could affect the future results of the company and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
these factors include local and national economic conditions  the amount of new construction  affordability of home ownership  interest rates on single family home mortgages and on the company s variable rate borrowings  government regulation  price inflation  the level of real estate and other taxes imposed on the properties  labor problems and natural disasters and other items discussed under risk factors in item of this report 
general the company s primary business is the operation of multifamily apartment properties as long term investments 
accordingly  the company s operating results will depend primarily on the net operating income generated by its multifamily apartment properties 
this  in turn  will depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the properties and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
several factors influence this  including local and national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction  interest rates on single family mortgage loans and the cost of home ownership 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s real estate properties as of december  
table of contents average number percentage number square feet of units of units economic property name location of units per unit occupied occupied occupancy arbor hills antioch  tn belvedere apartments naples  fl bluff ridge apartments jacksonville  nc brentwood oaks apartments nashville  tn coral point apartments mesa  az covey at fox valley aurora  il delta crossing charlotte  nc elliot s crossing apartments tempe  az fox hollow apartments high point  nc greenbriar apartments tulsa  ok highland park apartments columbus  oh the hunt apartments oklahoma city  ok huntsview apartments greensboro  nc jackson park place apartments fresno  ca lakes of northdale apartments tampa  fl littlestone of village green gallatin  tn misty springs apartments daytona beach  fl monticello apartments southfield  mi  oakhurst apartments ocala  fl oakwell farms apartments nashville  tn park at countryside port orange  fl the park at apartments chattanooga  tn the ponds at georgetown ann arbor  mi  the reserve at wescott plantation summerville  sc  tregaron oaks apartments bellevue  ne shelby heights bristol  tn waterman s crossing newport news  va waters edge apartments lake villa  il the exchange at palm bay palm bay  fl  n a  n a this is an office warehouse facility 
the figure represents square feet available for lease to tenants and percentage of square feet occupied 
economic occupancy is presented for the year ended december  economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income divided by the maximum amount of rental income which could be derived from each property 
the statistic is reflective of vacancy  rental concessions  delinquent rents  bad debt and non revenue units such as model units and employee units 
executive summary fiscal was a year of transition for the company 
during and  the multifamily real estate industry was negatively impacted by soft market conditions attributable to weak economic conditions  continued additional supply of multifamily housing properties and record low interest rates available to purchasers of single family housing 
in many of the markets in which our properties are located  these conditions improved in our physical occupancy increased by from to and the use of concessions decreased 
this allowed the company to increase its economic occupancy from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  demand for apartments in some markets improved due to continued job growth  which has assisted in the creation of new households 
even though home mortgage rates continue to remain relatively low  the creation of new households has strengthened demand for rental housing  especially among newly formed households 
while demand has strengthened in many markets  other factors have reduced the supply of available apartments 
in particular  the trend toward condominium conversion in florida has taken a number of rental units out of the market 
the company capitalized on this trend in by selling st 
andrews at westwood to a condominium converter for a gain of approximately million 

table of contents the other factor affecting the company was the completion of the transition from being an externally advised reit to being self advised through the acquisition of the advisor  for merger consideration of million on december  the acquisition of the advisor was an integral part of the company s strategic plan 
it simplifies the company s structure to facilitate more effective management of the company and adds an experienced management team to the company  which is better aligned with the interest of the shareholders 
management believes that as a self advised reit  it will have better access to the capital markets and a potentially reduced cost of capital 
the strategic plan calls for a secure and growing dividend while enhancing long term portfolio value through a selective acquisition and disposition program that increases our presence in markets with positive growth prospects 
although the termination of the advisory contract with advisor resulted in an million charge to our financial results  management expects the merger with the advisor to be accretive to earnings per share and funds from operations per share immediately through the elimination of the administrative fees previously paid to the advisor 
additionally  as the company seeks to expand its portfolio through the acquisition of apartment communities  we will benefit from the absence of property acquisition and administrative fees charged by the advisor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management of the company to make a number of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
the application of these judgments  assumptions and estimates can affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported by the company 
all of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements filed in response to item of this report 
the company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies as they involve judgments  assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate establishment of depreciation policy the company s investment in real estate is carried on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset  generally years on multifamily residential apartment buildings  years on commercial buildings and five to fifteen years on capital improvements  and is calculated using the straight line method 
depreciation of capital improvements on the company s commercial property is based on the term of the related tenant lease using the straight line method 
shorter or longer depreciable lives and method of depreciation directly impact depreciation expense recorded in earnings 
establishment of capitalization policy maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while significant improvements  renovations and replacements are capitalized 
the company s capitalization policy is based on management s judgment and is not necessarily consistent with companies of similar type as there is diversity in such accounting policies adopted by the real estate industry 
the company believes its policy is appropriate in that it capitalizes costs considered to add value to the property  while it expenses those costs which are considered recurring maintenance items 
in  the company modified its capitalization policy to capitalize appliances within the individual units including such items as ovens  refrigerators and water heaters 
as a result the company capitalized approximately  of such costs in in  the company further modified the capitalization policy to allow capitalization of flooring costs when an entire unit s carpet or vinyl flooring is replaced 
this change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and will be accounted for prospectively 
review of properties for impairment management reviews each property for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
the recognition of an impaired property and the potential impairment calculation are subject to a considerable degree of judgment  the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flow of each property is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts  future rental expenses  and future capital expenditures 
such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the properties operate  the current market values for properties in the rental markets  and tax and insurance expenses 
different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may result in different results 
investment in agency and corporate equity securities valuation because all of the company s investments in agency securities and corporate equity securities are classified as available for sale securities  they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values reflect the average of price quotes received from brokers  which are reviewed by the company 
price quotes are subject to the brokers judgments  assumptions and estimates 
if the estimated fair market value is less than the purchase price of the securities for an extended period of time  the company must also evaluate whether any unrealized losses represent an other than temporary impairment 
as of december   the unrealized losses on agency securities do not represent an other than temporary impairment  as the decline in the fair market value of these securities is solely due to increases in interest rates  and are not due to any impairment of the credit quality of the agency securities 

table of contents results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

to calculate ffo under the nareit definition  depreciation and amortization expenses related to the company s real estate  gains or losses realized from the disposition of depreciable real estate assets  and certain extraordinary items are added back to the company s net income 
the company believes that ffo is an important non gaap measurement because ffo excludes the depreciation expense on real estate assets and real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets such as machinery or equipment 
additionally  other real estate companies  analysts and investors utilize ffo in analyzing the results of real estate companies 
while the company uses the nareit definition of ffo  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits or real estate companies with similar assets 
this is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on ffo 
real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time whereas real estate costs that are expensed are accounted for as a current period expense 
this affects ffo because costs that are accounted for as expenses reduce ffo 
conversely  real estate costs that are capitalized and depreciated are added back to net income to calculate ffo 
the company s capitalization policy through was to treat most recurring capital improvements  such as appliances  vinyl flooring and carpet as expenses 

table of contents in  the company modified its capitalization policy 
the company now capitalizes the appliances within the individual units including such items as ovens  refrigerators and water heaters 
in  the company began capitalizing the cost of flooring for full unit replacement of carpet and vinyl flooring 
although the company considers ffo to be a useful measure of its operating performance  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income which is calculated in accordance with gaap 
supplemental operating performance statistics as property performance drives the overall financial results for the company  it is important to examine a few key property performance measures 
the following are high level performance measures management uses to gauge the overall performance of our property portfolio 
physical occupancy  economic occupancy  average annual rent per unit are performance measures that provide management an indication as to the quality of rental revenues 
physical occupancy is calculated simply as the percentage of units occupied out of the total units owned 
economic occupancy is calculated as the net rental revenue divided by the gross potential rental revenue which could be derived from the property portfolio 
economic occupancy is reflective of vacancy  rental concessions  delinquent rents  bad debts and non revenue units such as model units 
the average annual rent per unit is calculated as the total annualized net rental revenue divided by the total number of units owned 
real estate operating contribution is calculated as the excess of rental revenues over real estate operating expenses as a percentage of rental revenues  and provides management an indication as to the ability of the properties to manage expenses in the current occupancy environment 
note real estate operating contribution in and include property management fees which were eliminated in november  with the acquisition of certain assets from america first property management companies  llc 
the following table presents these measures as for the years ended december  december  december  physical occupancy economic occupancy average annual rent per unit real estate operating contribution average annual rent per unit in is significantly impacted by the acquisitions of the reserve at wescott plantation and tregaron oaks

arbor hills  the reserve at wescott plantation  and tregaron oaks were acquired by the company in december  september and august  respectively 
the amount computed for arbor hills is an annualized amount based upon the revenue earned during the company s ownership in the amounts for the reserve at wescott plantation  and tregaron oaks is an annualization of the revenues earned during the company s ownership in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by its real estate investments 
net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
this  in turn  is affected by several factors  such as local or national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and affordability of home ownership 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 
the company uses cash primarily to i pay the operating expenses of its multifamily apartment properties  including the cost of capital improvements and  prior to november  fees paid to the property manager  ii pay the operating expenses of the company s administration  including  through december  the fees paid to its advisor  iii pay debt service on its bonds and mortgages payable  iv acquire additional multifamily apartment properties  agency securities and other investments  and v pay dividends 

table of contents the company currently expects to maintain dividends at the current rate 
prior to  the company s cash provided by operating activities was insufficient to fully fund the current level of dividends 
while the company expects to be able to fund s dividends from cash provided by operations  it may be required to utilize other means including proceeds from the sale of properties 
the company s principal business strategy is to acquire and operate multifamily apartment properties as long term investments 
in order to achieve its acquisition strategy  the company has the authority to finance the acquisition of additional real estate in a variety of manners  including raising additional equity capital 
in june  the company filed a form s registration statement for million of capital stock which may be sold from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital in order to support the company s business strategy 
to date  no securities have been sold under this registration statement 
in addition to the funds that the company may raise through the issuance of additional equity capital  it may also be able to borrow money to finance the acquisition of additional real estate assets 
borrowing to acquire additional multifamily apartment properties is generally in the form of long term taxable or tax exempt mortgage loans secured by the acquired properties 
the amount of debt the company can incur is not limited by its articles of incorporation or otherwise 
in general  however  the amount of borrowing used to finance the overall multifamily apartment property portfolio is approximately to of the purchase price of these assets  although higher or lower levels of borrowings may be used on any single property 
the multifamily apartment properties which the company currently owns are financed under mortgage financings with an aggregate principal balance of million as of december  these mortgages consisted of fourteen tax exempt bonds with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of approximately million and seven taxable mortgage notes payable with a combined principal balance of approximately million 
approximately of these mortgage obligations bear interest at a fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  the remaining of these mortgage obligations bear interest at variable rates that had a weighted average interest rate of  including swaps  for the year ended december  maturity dates on these mortgage obligations range from november to november each of these mortgage loans has been made on a nonrecourse basis  which means that the lender s source of payment in the event of a default is limited to foreclosure of the underlying property securing the mortgage loan 
in addition  the company has borrowings in the form of notes payable 
the notes payable  which were assumed as part of the merger with afrez  bear interest at a variable rate with a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  these notes payable are due january  the company also has short term borrowings under repurchase agreements that bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  and mature within one year 
repurchase agreements are utilized by the company to meet short term working capital needs  and to finance certain investments  such as agency securities and the offutt mezzanine loan  as well as a portion of the cash consideration paid in the acquisition of the advisor 
repurchase agreements take the form of a sale of a security in this case  an agency security owned by the company to a counterparty at an agreed upon price in return for the counterparty s simultaneous agreement to resell the same securities back to the owner at a future date at a higher price 
although structured as a sale and repurchase obligation  a repurchase agreement operates as a borrowing under which the company pledges agency securities that it already owns as collateral to secure a short term loan with a counterparty 
the borrowings are then used to acquire agency securities  which themselves may be used as collateral for additional borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the difference between the sale and repurchase price is the cost  or interest expense  of borrowing under the repurchase agreements 
the repurchase agreements may require the company to pledge additional assets to the lender in the event the market value of existing pledged collateral declines below a specified percentage 
the pledged collateral may fluctuate in value due to  among other things  principal repayments  market changes in interest rates and credit quality 
the company retains beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral  including the right to distributions  while the counterparty maintains custody of the collateral securities 
at the maturity of a repurchase agreement  the company is required to repay the loan and concurrently receive back its pledged collateral from the lender or  may renew the repurchase agreement at the then prevailing financing rate 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million under short term repurchase agreements to finance its investment in agency securities 
these repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity of days 
management is contemplating the liquidation of the company s agency securities as the interest rate spread on these investments has narrowed 
if liquidated  the company will use the proceeds to repay its borrowings under the repurchase agreements 
to finance the offutt mezzanine loan and the advisor acquisition  the company utilized repurchase agreements collateralized by gnma securities of certain owned properties

fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the statement must be applied by december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on bonds and mortgage notes payable the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable rate long term borrowings and its repurchase agreements 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and enters into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company has not entered into derivative instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million in repurchase agreement borrowings  with a weighted average interest rate of 
variation in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowings on these agreements 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  as of december   approximately of the company s long term borrowings consisted of fixed rate financing 
the remaining consisted of variable rate financing 
variations in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowing on its variable rate financing 
the interest rates payable by the company on these obligations increase or decrease with certain index interest rates 
if the company s borrowing costs increase  the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders will decrease 
had the average index rates increased or decreased by basis points during the year ended december   interest expense on the company s variable rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately  the following table presents information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s bonds and mortgage payable in thousands fixed rate borrowings variable rate borrowings weighted weighted principal average principal average maturity amount interest rate maturity amount interest rate thereafter thereafter weighted average rate for the year ended december  
table of contents as of december   the company had entered into the following derivative financial instruments in thousands interest rate swaps and caps counterparty company notional receive notional pay maturity amount cap rate amount rate fixed to variable december  fixed to variable december  fixed to variable december  fixed to variable january  variable to fixed february  variable to fixed june  fixed to variable july  fixed to variable july  variable to fixed january  interest rate cap december   n a n a interest rate cap december   n a n a notional amount is tied to the exchange at palm bay bond payable and adjusts downward as principal payments are made on the bond payable 
weighted average bond market association rate for the three months ended december  weighted average bond market association rate for the three months ended december  plus 
these are total return swaps 
the million variable to fixed rate swap was entered into on top of and to mitigate the variable rate risk of those fixed to variable rate swaps maturing july  it effectively fixes the interest rate on million of bonds payable at through june  other than the million variable to fixed rate interest rate swap  entered into by the company in january  the interest rate swap and cap contracts owned by the company do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus are accounted for as free standing financial instruments which are marked to market each period through the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
for the swap that does qualify as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and partners capital 
as the above tables incorporate only those exposures or positions that existed as of december   they do not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s risk mitigating strategies at that time and interest rates 
prepayment risk on agency securities as the company receives repayments of principal on its agency securities  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires agency securities at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such agency securities or the par value of such agency securities if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s agency securities are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
credit risk of cash concentrations the company s cash and cash equivalents are deposited primarily in a trust account at a single financial institution and are not covered by the federal deposit insurance corporation
