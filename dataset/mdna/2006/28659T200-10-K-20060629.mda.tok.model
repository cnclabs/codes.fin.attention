critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgment  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include the recognition of revenue upon completion of certain phases of projects under research and development contracts 
the company also assesses a need for an allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses its exposure to current commitments and contingencies 
it should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the fair value of stock options held by employees and members of the board of directors which have been granted subsequent to march  is expected to continue to affect the results of operations of future periods  as we continue to grant or reprice stock options to reward our management team

general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended march   were  a decrease of  or approximately from g a for the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in litigation costs  bad debt expense  auditing and legal fees  somewhat offset by increases in salaries and staff

we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
in addition  we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report
