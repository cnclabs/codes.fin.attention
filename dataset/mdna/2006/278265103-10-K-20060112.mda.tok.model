despite the decrease in sales and the increase in redemptions  bank loan fund net flows remain positive and the funds continue to appeal to both retail and institutional investors in the current rising interest rate environment

class a share assets increased to percent of total assets under management at october  from percent and percent at october  and  respectively  while class b shares dropped to percent at october  from percent and percent at october  and  respectively 
the shift from class b share assets to class a share assets reflects the overall increasing popularity of class a shares in the industry and the declining popularity of class b shares as an asset class 
the percent decline in ending class b share assets under management in fiscal can also be partly attributed to the implementation of the automatic conversion of class b shares to class a shares after eight years of ownership for certain of the company s mutual funds

the shift in fund asset mix experienced by the company over the last twelve month period impacted the company s revenue and expense structure

net asset flows and changes in the market value of managed assets affect the amount of investment adviser and administration fees earned  while shifts in asset mix affect the company s effective fee rate 
the increase in investment adviser and administration fees of percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively  over the same periods a year earlier can be attributed primarily to an increase in average assets under management and secondarily to the shift in asset mix from lower fee fixed income to higher fee equity and floating rate bank loan 
average assets under management increased by percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively  over the same periods a year earlier 
distribution and underwriter fees distribution plan payments  which are made under contractual agreements with the company s sponsored funds  are calculated as a percentage of average assets under management in specific share classes of the company s mutual funds principally class b and class c  as well as certain private funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average assets under management and the relative mix of assets between share classes

underwriter commissions fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without sales charges 
distribution and underwriter fees decreased by percent in fiscal compared to the same period a year ago  primarily reflecting a decrease in average class b share assets under management 
as noted in the table average assets under management by asset class  average class b share assets under management declined percent year over year in fiscal  principally as a result of net redemptions in the asset class over the last twelve months 
the decrease in average class b share assets under management was in contrast to a percent increase in average class c share and private fund assets under management 
as noted above  class c shares and certain private funds are also subject to distribution fees

vs 
compensation of officers and employees amortization of deferred sales commissions service fee expense distribution expense other expenses total expenses compensation of officers and employees compensation expense increased by percent and percent in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  over the same periods a year earlier 
the increase in compensation expense in fiscal can be primarily attributed to a percent increase in headcount  higher operating income based employee bonus accruals  higher marketing incentives associated with the company s separately managed account business  and higher marketing incentives associated with the increase in long term fund sales 
the percent increase in headcount in fiscal reflects additions to the company s investment management  marketing and operational teams to support the significant growth in assets under management as well as the build out of the company s institutional sales team 
the increase in compensation expense in fiscal can be attributed to higher marketing incentives associated with a percent increase in fund and retail managed account sales  including the offering of billion of new closed end funds  the inclusion of parametric portfolio associates employee compensation for a full fiscal year and higher operating income based bonus accruals 
compensation costs of parametric portfolio associates after its acquisition by the company in september totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased by percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively  over the same periods a year earlier 
amortization expense is affected by ongoing sales and redemptions of mutual fund class b shares  class c shares and certain private funds 
in both fiscal and  increases in class c share and private fund sales were offset by a decrease in class b share sales 
as amortization expense is a function of the company s product mix  a continuing shift away from class b sales and assets to other classes over time will most likely result in further reductions in amortization expense 
service fees service fees the company receives from sponsored funds are generally retained by the company in the first year and paid to broker dealers after the first year pursuant to third party service arrangements

other expenses increased by percent in fiscal over the same period a year ago  primarily reflecting increases in fund related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in fund related expenses can be attributed to costs borne by the company to support product development prior to new product launch and payments made to external investment advisers for subadvisory services provided 
the increase in the amortization of intangible assets can be attributed to a million impairment loss recognized in the second quarter of fiscal relating to terminations of management contracts acquired by a majority owned subsidiary in fiscal other expenses increased by percent in fiscal  primarily as a result of including the facilities  information technology  consulting and amortization expenses of parametric portfolio associates following its acquisition by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal other income and expense for the years ended in thousands october  vs

deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid by the company to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds  bank loan interval funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which the shareholder is subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years 
distribution plan payments received by the company from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received by the company from redeeming shareholders of open end and bank loan interval funds reduce unamortized deferred sales commissions 
should the company lose its ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred sales commission assets as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of deferred sales commission assets may not be recoverable and adjusts the deferred sales commission assets accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the company s investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair values of the companies acquired to their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
the company periodically reviews identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the companies exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company s deferred taxes relate principally to capitalized sales commissions paid to broker dealers 
as noted previously  irs regulations issued in provide that commission payments made after november  are deductible for tax purposes at the time of payment 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing its taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to the company s tax position and effective tax rate 
investments in collateralized debt obligation entities the company acts as collateral manager for five collateralized debt obligation entities and eaton vance variable leveraged fund collectively the cdo entities pursuant to collateral management agreements between the company and each cdo entity 
at october   combined assets under management in the collateral pools of these cdo entities were approximately billion 
the company had combined minority equity investments of million in four of these entities on october  the company accounts for its investments in cdo entities under emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the excess of future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method 
the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each cdo investment pool to determine whether an impairment of its equity investments should be recognized 
cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of collateral securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities  the forecasted default rate of the collateral securities and the company s past experience in managing similar securities 
if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 
fair value is determined using current information  notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest 
market yields  default rates and recovery rates used in the company s estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools 
in periods of rising credit default rates and lower debt recovery rates  the fair value  and therefore carrying value  of the company s investments in these cdo entities may be adversely affected 
the company s risk of loss in the cdo entities is limited to the million carrying value of the minority equity investments on the company s consolidated balance sheet at october  a cdo entity issues non recourse debt securities  which are sold in a private offering by an underwriter to institutional and high net worth investors 
the cdo debt securities issued by the cdo entity are secured by collateral in the form of high yield bonds and or floating rate income instruments that the cdo entity purchases 
the company manages the collateral securities for a fee and  in most cases  is a minority investor in the equity interests of the cdo entity 
an equity interest in a cdo entity is subordinated to all other interests in the cdo entity and entitles the investor to receive the residual cash flows  if any  from the cdo entity 
as a result  the company s equity investment in a cdo entity is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities  including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates 
the company s financial exposure to the cdos it manages is limited to its equity interests in the cdo entities as reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
loss contingencies the company continuously reviews any investor  employee or vendor complaints and pending or threatened litigation 
the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated under the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  through consultation with legal counsel and a loss contingency is recorded if the contingency is probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
there are no losses of this nature that are probable and reasonably estimable  and thus none have been recorded in the financial statements included in this report 
accounting developments in june  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
the task force reached a consensus that for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified  the guidance is effective after june  the task force also reached a consensus that for general partners in all other limited partnerships  the guidance is effective no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the consensus will not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of the company 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requiring public companies to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in their financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company intends to apply the modified version of retrospective application for periods prior to the required effective date and will adjust results on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures previously made under sfas no 
the revised statement is effective for the company s first fiscal quarter beginning november  had the company implemented the provisions of sfas no 
as revised for the years ended october   and  diluted earnings per share would have been  and  respectively 
in its calculations of stock option expense for the purposes of pro forma disclosure  the company previously chose to recognize forfeitures when they occurred rather than estimate them at grant date 
upon implementation  if actual forfeitures of awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
as revised differ from the calculation of expected forfeitures for these awards  the company will be required to recognize the difference in income as an adjustment to compensation cost 
the company does not anticipate that this adjustment will be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb ratified the consensus of the eitf regarding the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  states that any shares of common stock that may be issued to settle contingently convertible securities must be considered issued in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
the consensus  which was effective for all reporting periods ending after december   required the restatement of diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented 
the retroactive application of eitf had the effect of reducing the company s earnings per share by  and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subjected to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that the company will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk  or currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposure to equity price risk arises from its investments in sponsored equity funds 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares 
the company s investments in sponsored equity funds totaled million at october   and are carried at fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s primary exposure to interest rate risk arises from its investment in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored by the company and short term debt securities 
the negative effect on the company s pre tax interest income of a basis point decline in interest rates would be approximately million based on fixed income and floating rate bank loan income investments of million as of october  a basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical scenario used to demonstrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
the company is not exposed to interest rate risk in its issued debt instruments as the company s only funded debt instruments accrete interest at a fixed rate 
the company s primary exposure to credit risk arises from its minority equity interests in four cdo entities that are included in long term investments in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as a minority equity investor in a cdo entity  the company is entitled to only a residual interest in the cdo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default rates of the underlying issuers of the high yield bonds or floating rate income instruments held by the cdo entity 
the company s minority equity investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of the issuers underlying the collateral securities and a corresponding increase in the number of defaults  cash flows generated by the collateral securities may be adversely impacted and the company may be unable to recover its investment 
the company s total investment in minority equity interests in cdo entities is approximately million at october   which represents the total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes and currently has no material investments that would expose it to foreign currency exchange risk 
in evaluating market risk  it is also important to note that most of the company s revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in competitive conditions and risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values will negatively impact the company s revenue and net income
