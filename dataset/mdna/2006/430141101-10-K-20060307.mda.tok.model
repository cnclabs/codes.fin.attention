item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview highland hospitality corporation is a self advised reit that was incorporated in july to own upscale full service  premium limited service  and extended stay properties located in major convention  business  resort and airport markets in the united states and all inclusive resort properties in certain beachfront destinations outside of the united states 
we commenced operations on december  when we completed our ipo and concurrently acquired three hotel properties 
since the ipo and the acquisition of our first three hotel properties  we have acquired hotel properties not including the nashville renaissance hotel acquired on february  
as of december   we owned the following hotel properties property number of rooms location acquired portsmouth renaissance and conference center portsmouth  va december  sugar land marriott and conference center sugar land  tx december  hilton garden inn virginia beach town center virginia beach  va december  plaza san antonio marriott san antonio  tx december  hyatt regency savannah savannah  ga december  hilton tampa westshore tampa  fl january  hilton garden inn bwi airport linthicum  md january  dallas fort worth airport marriott dallas fort worth  tx may  residence inn tampa downtown tampa  fl august  courtyard savannah historic district savannah  ga august  hyatt regency wind watch long island hauppauge  ny august  courtyard boston tremont boston  ma august  crowne plaza atlanta ravinia atlanta  ga august  hilton parsippany parsippany  nj august  radisson mount laurel mount laurel  nj september  omaha marriott omaha  ne september  courtyard denver airport denver  co september  sheraton annapolis annapolis  md february  barcel tucancun beach cancun  mexico april  wyndham palm springs palm springs  ca july  hilton boston back bay boston  ma october  westin princeton at forrestal village princeton  nj november  the churchill washington  dc december  total number of rooms substantially all of our assets are held by  and all of our operations are conducted through  highland hospitality  lp our operating partnership 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  neither our company nor the operating partnership can operate hotels directly 
therefore  the operating partnership  which is owned approximately by us and approximately by other limited partners  leases its hotels to subsidiaries of hhc trs holding corporation collectively  hhc trs  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
hhc trs then engages hotel management companies to operate the hotels pursuant to management contracts 
hhc trs is treated as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
key operating metrics hotel results of operations are best explained by three key performance indicators occupancy  average daily rate adr and revenue per available room revpar  which is room revenue divided by total number of room nights 
revpar does not include food and beverage revenues or other ancillary revenues  such as telephone  parking or other guest services provided by the property 

table of contents occupancy is a major driver of room revenue  as well as other revenue categories  such as food and beverage and telephone 
adr helps to drive room revenue as well  however  it does not have a direct effect on other revenue categories 
fluctuations in occupancy are accompanied by fluctuations in most categories of variable operating costs  such as utility costs and certain labor costs such as housekeeping  resulting in varying levels of hotel profitability 
increases in adr typically result in higher hotel profitability since variable hotel expenses generally do not increase correspondingly 
thus  increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs  while increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr are accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees 
executive summary of events the lodging industry continued to demonstrate strong operating fundamentals during according to smith travel research str  revpar industry wide in the united states increased for  as compared to more importantly  revpar for the upper upscale segment  which represents a majority of our hotels  increased in  as compared to demand growth for hotel rooms continued to outpace supply growth 
according to str  for industry wide  demand for hotel rooms increased by and supply growth increased  as compared to with demand growth expected to continue to outpace supply growth over the next couple of years  industry occupancy should continue to move higher and position our industry for additional pricing power 
similar revpar trends are expected in  with industry profitability predicted to be at its highest level in history 
as for highland hospitality  was another year of significant growth  as we added another six properties for approximately million 
the acquisitions included the room sheraton annapolis hotel in annapolis  maryland  the room barcel tucancun beach resort in cancun  mexico  the room wyndham palm springs hotel in palm springs  california  the room hilton boston back bay hotel in boston  massachusetts  the room westin princeton at forrestal village hotel in princeton  new jersey  and the room churchill hotel in washington  dc 
the acquisitions will further diversify our portfolio and provide incremental value with strong current returns and significant growth potential in and beyond 
we also remained active in the capital markets  selling approximately million of common and preferred equity and borrowing approximately million in mortgage debt 
we ended the year with approximately billion of assets and approximately million of long term debt  of which was at fixed interest rates 
in addition to the six acquisitions  much of our efforts focused on repositioning and rebranding seven hotels or of our total rooms based on our january  room count 
during  major renovations were completed at the plaza san antonio marriott hotel  the crowne plaza atlanta ravinia hotel  the hyatt regency savannah hotel  and the hyatt regency wind watch long island hotel 
in addition  major renovations were ongoing at three other hotel properties  including the courtyard boston tremont hotel  the radisson mount laurel hotel which we plan to convert to the marriott brand upon completion  and the hilton parsippany hotel 
the courtyard boston tremont hotel and the radisson mount laurel hotel projects are expected to be completed in march and the hilton parsippany project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter once completed  we expect to have invested approximately million on the seven major renovations 
although these efforts made for a challenging operating environment in  we are extremely pleased with the results  revenues and profitability for the hotels completed in have begun to increase significantly over comparative numbers in moreover  we expect the remaining projects to provide similar results as we move into the second half of although the renovation activity did have a negative impact on overall portfolio performance in  we were pleased with the performance of our stabilized hotels 
we experienced strong revpar increases for our stabilized hotels in  with revpar increasing  as compared to the prior year 
these revpar increases were well above market and industry trends 
in addition  our stabilized hotels operating margins 
table of contents continued to improve in hotel operating income for our stabilized hotels increased to million in  as compared  and hotel operating income margins increased percentage points to  which well exceeded the industry average for we believe that we enter with a high quality hotel portfolio both stabilized and recently renovated poised to produce significant increases in both revenues and cash flow as our industry continues to thrive and the performance of our repositioned assets benefit from the capital we have invested 
we will continue to maintain an active pipeline of investment opportunities and selectively acquire high quality assets located in major  high barrier to entry markets with strong current yields and solid bottom line growth potential  similar to the three urban hotel properties acquired in the fourth quarter  while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and results of operations for the year ended december  include the operating activity of hotels for a full year and six hotels for a partial year 
results of operations for the year ended december  include the operating activity of five hotels for a full year and hotels for a partial year see table above for hotel property acquisition dates 
as such  comparisons of results of operations for the year ended december  versus the prior year are not meaningful due to the lack of comparability 
revenues total revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the prior year 
total revenue for the year ended december  included rooms revenue of million  food and beverage revenue of million  and other revenue of million 
total revenue for the year ended december  included rooms revenue of million  food and beverage revenue of million  and other revenue of million

rebranded renovated includes hotels that are currently going through  or have recently gone through  significant renovation and or in the process of changing  or have recently changed  their franchise affiliation 
stabilized includes hotels that are not being disrupted by renovation or rebranding efforts

driving the increase in revpar for the stabilized hotels were the hilton tampa westshore hotel  the sugar land marriott hotel  the hilton garden inn virginia beach town center hotel  and the courtyard savannah historic district hotel  where each experienced double digit revpar growth for although revpar for the rebranded renovated hotels decreased for the full year  as renovations were 
table of contents completed at four of our hotels during  we began to see significant improvements in revpar for those hotels  attributed to higher adrs we achieved as rooms came back on line 
we believe that these above market and above industry trends will continue in hotel operating expenses hotel operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million for the prior year 
direct hotel operating expenses for the year ended december  included rooms expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and other direct expenses of million

for the comparable hotels  hotel operating income increased by to million from the prior year and hotel operating income margins increased by percentage points to 
driving the increase in hotel operating income and margins for the stabilized hotels were the hilton tampa westshore hotel  the sugar land marriott hotel  the dallas fort worth airport marriott hotel  and the omaha marriott hotel 
although hotel operating income for the rebranded renovated hotels decreased for the full year  as renovations were completed at four of our hotels during  we began to see significant improvements in hotel operating income for those hotels  attributed to higher adrs we achieved as rooms came back on line 
we believe that these above market and above industry trends will continue in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in versus was directly attributable to the increase in investment in hotel properties over the two year period

included in corporate general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation expense 

table of contents interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in interest income in versus was mostly attributable to the increase in short term investment yields  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents over the two year period

the increase in interest expense in versus was directly attributable to the increase in outstanding long term debt over the two year period 
income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the prior year 
income tax expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from taxable operating income incurred by our trs and the operating partnership s subsidiary that owns the barcel tucancun beach resort  whereas the income tax benefit for the year ended december  resulted from taxable operating losses incurred by our trs

the income tax benefit resulted from a taxable operating loss incurred by our trs lessees for the year ended december  as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million  primarily due to tax net operating losses 
these loss carryforwards will begin to expire in if not utilized by then 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized and have determined that no valuation allowance is required 
net income net income for the year ended december  was million  due to the items discussed above 
period from december  through december  results of operations for the period from december  through december  include the operating activity of three hotels for days  one hotel for three days  and one hotel for two days 
the results of operations for the period from december  through december  are not indicative of future operating results for the five hotels  as the fourth quarter  in particular the weeks before and after the christmas holiday  are traditionally slower periods for business and leisure travel

these charges included million related to director stock based compensation and million related to start up costs and reimbursements to barcel crestline  which was the sponsor of our formation and ipo 
operating loss for the period from december  through december  was million  largely due to the items discussed above 
interest income and the minority interest in our operating partnership for the period from december  through december  were million and million  respectively 
as a result of our operating losses for the period from december  through december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
net loss for the period from december  through december  was million 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our operating requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  is from our hotels results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations  including distributions to stockholders required to maintain our reit status and our required debt service obligations 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  including million to purchase the sheraton annapolis hotel  the tucancun beach resort and villas  the wyndham 
table of contents palm springs hotel  the hilton boston back bay hotel  the westin princeton at forrestal village hotel  and the churchill hotel 
we used million in improvements and additions to our hotel properties  the majority of which was used for the major renovations taking place at seven of our hotel properties 
we received a net million from our restricted cash escrow accounts 
the majority of the million cash inflow related to reimbursements from one of our loan servicers that required us to escrow million for renovations on the hotels that secure the lending 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million 
in september  we completed an underwritten public offering and sold  shares of common stock  including  shares sold as a result of the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  and  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
in october  we sold an additional  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  as a result of the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  we generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we also generated million from the issuance of mortgage loans secured by the wyndham palm springs hotel  the sheraton annapolis hotel  and the hilton boston back bay hotel and million from additional borrowings under the term loan facility 
we used million to pay dividends to common and preferred stockholders and million to make regularly scheduled principal payments on our long term debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
on january   we generated million from the issuance of a mortgage loan secured by the westin princeton at forrestal village hotel 
on february   we acquired the nashville renaissance hotel for approximately million 
also on february   we extinguished our million term loan facility and completed a separate unsecured revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments of up to million with an option to increase the amount of the facility by up to million 
the amount that we can borrow under the revolving credit facility is based on the value of our unencumbered hotel properties included in the borrowing base  as defined in the agreement 
as of february   the maximum borrowing availability under the facility was approximately million  of which million was drawn down on that date to pay off the term loan facility and pay closing costs on the new facility 
as of february   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of million 
we expect to use million in april to purchase the room courtyard gaithersburg washingtonian center hotel in gaithersburg  maryland  which has been under a definitive agreement since june in connection with the acquisition of the hilton parsippany hotel  the crowne plaza atlanta ravinia hotel  the hyatt regency wind watch long island hotel  and the courtyard boston tremont hotel  we completed a million financing  comprised of a million mortgage loan and a million mezzanine loan 
the loan agreements contain a restrictive provision that requires the loan servicer to retain in escrow excess cash flow from the encumbered hotel properties if net cash flow  as defined  for the trailing months declines below a specified threshold 
for the months ended december   net cash flow from the four hotel properties did not exceed the specified threshold 
the loan servicer has the right to retain in escrow excess cash flow from the four hotel properties until the hotels generate the minimum cash flow required for three consecutive months  at which time the cash being held in escrow will be released to us 
should the loan servicer retain excess cash flows from the four hotel properties  we do not expect it to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to service debt  pay dividends to stockholders  or acquire additional hotel properties 
in december  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  registering equity securities with a maximum aggregate offering price of up to million 
as of december   we had equity securities with a maximum aggregate offering price of million available to issue 

table of contents in april  we acquired the room tucancun beach resort and villas in cancun  mexico and converted the resort to the barcel brand 
in october  hurricane wilma made landfall in cancun  mexico causing substantial wind and water damage to the resort 
the majority of damage affected the grounds of the resort and the first level of the hotel  including significant structural damage to the sea wall and damage to the lobby  restaurant and pool areas 
we have comprehensive insurance coverage for both property damage and business interruption 
although significant progress has been made to restore the damaged areas  as of the date hereof  the resort is still closed 
we expect that the barcel tucancun beach resort will reopen for business at the end of april as a result of hurricane wilma and the risks associated with the renovation and ramp up of the resort  we are exploring alternatives with regard to this investment  including its possible sale 
we will also be reviewing and potentially reevaluating our overall business strategy which allocates a portion of our investment capacity to resort locations in mexico and the caribbean 
capital expenditures we maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and the agreed upon requirements in our management agreements 
the cost of all such routine maintenance  repairs and alterations will be paid out of property improvement reserves  which will be funded by a portion of hotel gross revenues 
routine repairs and maintenance will be administered by the management companies 
however  we have approval rights over capital expenditures 
during  major renovations were completed at the following hotel properties a guest room  restaurant  lounge and lobby renovation at the plaza san antonio marriott hotel  a guest room  restaurant  lounge and lobby renovation at the crowne plaza atlanta ravinia hotel  a guest room  junior ballroom  restaurant  lounge and lobby renovation at the hyatt regency savannah hotel  and a guest room  restaurant  lounge and lobby renovation at the hyatt regency wind watch long island hotel 
in addition  major renovations were ongoing at three other hotel properties 
these projects include a guest room  lobby and restaurant renovation at the courtyard boston tremont hotel  a guest room  restaurant  bar and lobby renovation at the radisson mount laurel hotel  and a guest room  lobby  restaurant and ballroom renovation at the hilton parsippany hotel 
the courtyard boston tremont hotel and the radisson mount laurel hotel projects are expected to be completed in march and the hilton parsippany project in the fourth quarter we expect to invest approximately million on the major renovations at the seven hotel properties  of which approximately million had been invested through december  we expect that the majority of the remaining cash will be committed or spent by the end of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
there were no other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years ground and building leases mortgage loans  including interest mezzanine loan  including interest term loan facility  including interest included in the table are the base rent payments ie  minimum lease payments due under the ground and building lease agreements for the portsmouth renaissance hotel and adjoining conference center and the conference center and parking facility adjoining the sugar land 
table of contents marriott hotel 
the lease agreements provide for base rent payments each year and additional rent payments once we have exceeded a specified return on our original investment 
additional rent payments are not included in the table due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the payments in the future 
however  we do not expect to make additional rent payments over the next five years 
assumes no additional borrowings under the term loan facility and interest payments based on the interest rate in effect as of december  inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in the winter months 
we expect that our operations will generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
accordingly  we expect that we will have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
these general trends are  however  expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements investment in hotel properties investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using cost segregation studies performed by management and independent third parties 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts  including lease  management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
contracts acquired which are at market do not have significant value 
an existing management or franchise agreement is typically terminated at the time of acquisition and a new agreement is entered into based on then current market terms 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel property exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
for restricted stock awards  we record unearned compensation equal to the number of shares awarded multiplied by the average price of our common stock on the date of the award  less the purchase price for the stock  if any 
unearned compensation is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period 
for unrestricted stock awards  we record compensation expense on the date of the award equal to the number of shares awarded multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the date of the award  less the purchase price for the stock  if any 
revenue recognition hotel revenues  including room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
because of expected future taxable income of our trs lessees  we have not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset as of december  should our estimate of future taxable income be less than expected  we would record an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the provisions of sfas r were effective as of january  since we currently use the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  the adoption of sfas r did not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of december  fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle 
sfas also carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized with a cumulative effect adjustment in net income of the period of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk 
as of december   million or of our million of long term debt was fixed 
another million was effectively fixed  as a result of an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate on one of our mortgage loans at 
the remaining million of our long term debt was variable 
due to the fact that our portfolio of long term debt is substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  the fair value of our portfolio of long term debt would increase by approximately million 
although a change in market interest rates impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt  it has no impact on interest expense incurred or cash flows 
with respect to our variable rate long term debt  if market rates of interest on our variable long term debt increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable long term debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest on our variable rate long term debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate long term debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our term loan facility remains at million  the balance at december  foreign currency risk we are not significantly exposed to foreign currency risk 
the majority of revenue from operations at the barcel tucancun beach resort are denominated in us dollars and the majority of operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos 
a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso would not have a material affect on our results of operations
