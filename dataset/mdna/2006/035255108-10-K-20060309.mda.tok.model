item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section of this annual report on form k titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results  performance  or achievement  expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
we discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this annual report on form k and under the heading business and risk factors the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of anika therapeutics  inc and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
management overview anika therapeutics  inc anika  the company  we  us or our develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products for tissue protection and healing 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
our currently manufactured and marketed products consist of orthovisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of some forms of osteoarthritis in humans  amvisc  amvisc plus  staarviscs ii  and shellgel  each an injectable ophthalmic viscoelastic ha product  and hyvisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of equine osteoarthritis 
in the us orthovisc is marketed by depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  under the terms of a licensing  distribution  supply and marketing agreement 
outside the us  orthovisc has been approved for sale since and is marketed by distributors in over countries 
hyvisc is marketed in the us through boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc we developed and manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus for bausch lomb incorporated under a multiyear supply agreement 
products in development include redefyne  an ha based dermal filler used for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta applications  and incert  an ha based anti adhesive for surgical applications 
in september  we filed a pre market approval pma application with the fda seeking approval to market and sell redefyne in the united states 
we received conformit europ enne marking ce marking  a foreign regulatory approval for commercial marketing and sale  for incert in the third quarter of we received ce marking approval for cta in the first quarter of osteoarthritis business we have marketed orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  internationally since through various distribution agreements 
international sales of orthovisc contributed of product revenue for the year ended december  and increased compared to the increase was primarily due to increased market penetration in turkey  canada  europe and the middle east 
we expect international sales to grow in compared to reflecting further increased market penetration in certain of our existing markets as well as anticipated expansion into new international markets 
for these new opportunities we have assessed the world market and we are actively pursuing commercial partners 
as discussed in part above  orthovisc became available for sale in the us on march   and is marketed by depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  under the terms of a ten year licensing  distribution  supply and marketing agreement the jnj agreement 
the jnj agreement was originally entered into with ortho biotech products  lp obp  also a johnson johnson company  and was assigned to depuy mitek in mid sales of orthovisc in the us contributed of our product revenue for the year ended december   considerably lower than due to initial overstocking of product by obp in consequently no units were sold to obp depuy mitek after march of  however inventory levels have now been reduced to the point where a more regular order flow is expected for sales of orthovisc to end users grew slower than anticipated in and as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that a primary contributing factor to this slower growth has been reimbursement and the lack of receiving assignment of a specific reimbursement code 
the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs is a comprehensive and standardized coding system that describes classifications of like products that are medical in nature by category for the purpose of efficient claims processing 
hcpcs codes are assigned by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
as is typical for a newly introduced medical device  initial sales of orthovisc were made without a unique reimbursement code and reimbursement submissions were made using a miscellaneous code with no specified reimbursement dollar value 
we believe that using the miscellaneous reimbursement code without a specified reimbursement dollar value negatively impacted end user sales of orthovisc in and ortho biotech  with our help  submitted an application to secure a unique reimbursement code for orthovisc in march in november  ortho biotech received a decision on the application which assigned a unique reimbursement code to be used by hospitals in an outpatient setting the c code which specifies a reimbursement dollar value 
use of the c code was effective in january the cms decision  however  did not assign a unique reimbursement code to be used in the physician office setting the j code as at the time we did not yet have six months of sales history required by cms to make a decision 
an updated application for a unique j code was submitted in january in late october  cms issued a new j code j  which was to include all fda approved ha based products for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  for use starting on january  in early november  cms announced they wanted to further study the situation and therefore would not implement the october decision  and that the codes used in were to continue to be used in as a result  we expect reimbursement for orthovisc in the physician office setting to continue to use a miscellaneous j code 
the continued required use of a miscellaneous j code may result in physician reluctance to utilize orthovisc as compared to if a unique j code had been assigned 
there can be no assurance regarding the future course cms will set for orthovisc reimbursement 
while the j code has no effect on product pricing  the mitek team is taking significant steps to assist in the reimbursement process in physicians offices 
at the end of the year  mitek had a specialty sales force of about professionals to support the sales representatives and provide hands on assistance to the physicians offices 
mitek plans to significantly increase the number of specialists in mitek also has developed a web site for physicians office personnel as a resource for reimbursement issues 
sales of hyvisc  our product for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  contributed to product revenue for the year ended december  and was essentially flat compared to we continue to look at other veterinary applications and opportunities to expand geographic territories 
ophthalmic business our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
for the year ended december   sales of ophthalmic products contributed of our product revenue reflecting a decrease in sales of ophthalmic products of compared to sales to bausch lomb accounted for of ophthalmic sales for and contributed of product revenue for the period 
our former distributor for coease  advanced medical optics amo  completed the acquisition of the surgical ophthalmology business of pfizer  inc  in september  which included a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
as a result  our agreement with amo expired according to its terms in june there were no sales to amo in the second half of sales to amo decreased for compared to last year 
sales to amo contributed of ophthalmic product revenue and of total product revenue for the year ended december  in december  we entered into a multi year supply agreement the b l agreement with bausch lomb for viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
under the new agreement  which extends through december   and superseded the existing supply contract that was set to expire december   we will continue to be the exclusive global supplier other than with respect to japan for amvisc and amvisc plus to bausch lomb 
the b l agreement also provides us with a right to negotiate to manufacture future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by bausch lomb  while bausch lomb has been granted rights to commercialize certain future surgical ophthalmic viscoelastic products developed by us 
the b l agreement applies to all products sold by us to bausch lomb from the beginning of  with a price increase starting in under the b l agreement  we are entitled to continue providing surgical viscoelastic products to our existing customers staar surgical company and cytosol ophthalmics  inc who currently receive such products from us 
research and development redefyne  our product for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta  is based on a family of chemically modified  cross linked forms of ha designed for longer duration in the body 
cosmetic tissue augmentation is a therapy designed as a soft tissue filler for facial wrinkles  scar remediation and lip augmentation 
this new class of tissue filler technology based on ha is intended to supplant collagen based products and to compete with other ha based products currently on the market 
in october  we completed a pivotal us clinical trial to evaluate cta s effectiveness for correcting nasolabial folds 
the trial was conducted by dermatologists and plastic surgeons at centers throughout the us the six month primary endpoint results of this trial were submitted to the us food and drug administration fda in a pre market approval pma application in september in the first quarter of  we received ce mark approval to market redefyne in the european union 
in july we entered into an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization partnership the orthoneutrogena agreement for our cta products with the orthoneutrogena division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson 
under the terms of the orthoneutrogena agreement  we received an initial payment of  in addition  orthoneutrogena  subject to certain limitations  funded our pivotal clinical trial of our cta product completed in october on september   the company announced that it had mutually agreed with orthoneutrogena to terminate its development and commercialization agreement  and as noted above  we filed our pma with the fda seeking approval to market and sell our cta product in the united states 
the company will continue the development effort on a go forward basis which will be self funded 
we are currently seeking a worldwide distribution partner for this product 
incert s is our product designed to reduce post surgical fibrosis following spinal surgery 
we completed a pilot human clinical trial in europe in december involving patients undergoing spinal surgery  and demonstrated safety 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue from the sales of products we manufacture upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
orthovisc has been sold through several distribution arrangements as well as outsource order processing arrangements logistic agents 
sales of product through third party logistics agents in certain markets are recognized as revenue upon shipment by the logistics agent to the customer 
under the b l agreement  the price for units sold in a calendar year was dependent on total unit volume of sales to bausch lomb and other customers of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
prices fluctuated based on sales levels  and interim quarters were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume for the year became known 
given the pricing in this arrangement was not fixed and was determined based on qualifying sales to multiple customers  we determined that we could not reliably estimate the rebate  and accordingly  we deferred the maximum rebate that could be due until the annual sales volume was known in the fourth quarter 
under the b l agreement  the pricing is based solely on ophthalmic products sold to bausch lomb 
while the unit prices will be discounted for those units in excess of cumulative quarterly minimum sales levels  no additional amounts will be rebated 
starting in the first quarter  the applicable discount has been measured quarterly  subject to adjustment based on cumulative annual thresholds 
in july the company entered into an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization agreement the orthoneutrogena agreement for our cta products with the orthoneutrogena  a division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson 
this arrangement included up front payments  specified funding of ongoing development activities  milestones upon achievement of predefined goals  and payments for supply of cta products and royalties on sales 
under the eitf framework  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have stand alone value and there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
while this arrangement included several elements  we believed that two separate units of accounting existed a combined license and development unit and a manufacturing unit under the eitf model 
we accounted for the combined license and development unit using the performance based revenue recognition model 
pursuant to this model  we estimated both the total revenues we expected to earn and the expenses we expected to incur related to the license and development unit 
we recognized revenue based on the proportion of effort expended to total estimated effort  limited to the amount of non refundable cash received or receivable 
quarterly  we reviewed our estimates of total revenue and expenses related to the license and development unit 
actual revenue earned and or expenses incurred may differ from our estimates and may have a material effect upon our results of operations 
under the orthoneutrogena agreement  we received non refundable upfront fees of  and reimbursement for approximately  of costs which we incurred prior to the inception date of this agreement 
we have treated both these amounts as upfront fees that we recognized over the expected term of the license and development unit 
in addition to the upfront fees  we received reimbursement of pre approved development costs 
for  we recognized  as contract revenue under this arrangement pursuant to the performance based model 
for the six months ended june  we recognized an additional  as contract revenue under this arrangement pursuant to the performance based model 
on september   the company announced that it had mutually agreed with orthoneutrogena to terminate its development and commercialization agreement 
the company received a payment of  from oni including a  contract termination fee 
given that there were no continuing performance obligations with respect to the development and commercialization agreement or the related termination agreement  all amounts were recognized during the third quarter of  including  of previously deferred revenue under the performance based model 
total contract revenue recognized during related to the agreements with orthoneutrogena was  in december the company entered into a ten year licensing and supply agreement the jnj agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market orthovisc in the us 
in mid  the agreement was assigned to depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
under the jnj agreement  depuy mitek performs sales  marketing and distribution functions and licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as other new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on the company s viscosupplementation technology 
in support of the license  the jnj agreement provides that depuy mitek will fund post marketing clinical trials for new indications of orthovisc 
the company received an initial payment of  upon entering into the jnj agreement  a milestone payment of  in february  as a result of obtaining fda approval of orthovisc and a milestone payment of  in december for planned upgrades to our manufacturing operations 
we evaluated the terms of the jnj agreement and determined that the upfront fee and milestone payments did not meet the conditions to be recognized separately from the supply agreement  therefore  we have deferred non refundable payments received of  which we are recognizing ratably over the expected year term of the jnj agreement 
under the jnj agreement  we are the exclusive supplier of orthovisc to depuy mitek  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
the jnj agreement provides for additional sales based milestone payments to us contingent upon achieving specified sales targets  in addition to royalty and transfer fees 
the jnj agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and is otherwise renewable by depuy mitek for consecutive five year terms 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
we record a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse 
in  we achieved milestones under the jnj agreement and received payments totaling  which we recognized as taxable income in as a result  we utilized all of our net operating loss and credit carry forwards in our tax return to offset part of our taxable income 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for financial statement purposes  the milestone payments totaling  were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the expected ten year term of the jnj agreement 
in  based on management s expectations regarding future profitability  we released the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets and recorded a one time income tax benefit of  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  statement of operations detail year ended december  product revenue licensing  milestone and contract revenue total revenue operating expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes benefit from release of valuation allowance net income product gross profit product gross margin net and operating income

revenue total revenue for the year ended december  increased  to  compared to  for primarily due to the receipt of  in connection with the termination of the orthoneutrogena agreement 
however  product revenue for decreased  to  for two primary reasons 
sales of orthovisc to depuy mitek in were significantly lower than in due to overstocking of inventory by jnj in  and advanced medical optics did not renew their contract with us as they acquired a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
see below for further details 
product revenue by product line 
product revenue for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or  compared with  for the year ended december  year ended december  ophthalmic products orthovisc hyvisc ophthalmic products sales decreased  or  to  the decrease was primarily attributable to the loss of business from advanced medical optics 
sales to advanced medical optics decreased to  from  or  in compared to last year  and contributed only of ophthalmic product revenue for versus in the decrease in sales to advanced medical optics was attributable to advanced medical optics acquisition of a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
our agreement with advanced medical optics expired according to its terms in june this decrease was partially offset by increased sales to bausch lomb and  to a lesser extent  to increased sales to each of our other ophthalmic customers 
our sales of orthovisc decreased  or  to  in as compared with  in the decrease in orthovisc sales for was primarily due to overstocking of inventory by jnj in this resulted in substantially lower purchases of orthovisc by jnj from the company in this domestic decrease was partially offset by continued robust international sales 
us sales of orthovisc were  or of product sales  in compared to  or of product sales  in the impact of the decrease in unit sales was partially offset by a increase in royalty fees tied to end user sales  and increased international sales 
international sales of orthovisc increased to  from  or in compared to the same periods last year 
the increase in international sales was primarily attributable to increased market penetration by our distributors in turkey  canada  western europe and middle east countries 
we expect both us and international sales to increase in compared to reflecting increased market penetration in certain of our existing markets as well as expansion into new international markets 
sales of hyvisc were essentially flat in as compared to and represented and  respectively  of product sales 
sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which expires in may we expect this agreement to be renewed 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for licensing and milestone revenue includes the ratable recognition of the  in up front and milestone payments from ortho biotech 
these amounts are being recognized in income ratably over the ten year expected life of the agreement  or  per quarter 
contract revenue was  for  compared to  in revenue in consisted of  for reimbursement of clinical and development costs due under the orthoneutrogena contract  and a  termination fee to exit the contract 
as previously discussed  on september   the company announced that it had mutually agreed with orthoneutrogena to terminate its development and commercialization agreement 
all amounts due and contractual obligations by both parties have been satisfied 
product gross profit 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in product gross margin was mainly due to three factors the cost impact of a midyear product recall totaling  a lower margin product mix  and volume based inefficiencies in our manufacturing process 
we expect product gross margin to improve in compared to reflecting improved product mix and higher manufacturing volume  partially offset by the impact of the implementation of stock option expensing in under sfas r 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house research and development efforts for the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management and cost of clinical trials  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the increase in research and development expenses during was primarily attributable to expenditures associated with the pivotal clinical trial for our cta product initiated in and completed in late  as well as engineering and scale up activities in preparation for the manufacture of our cta product 
the company filed a pma application with the fda based on the results of this clinical trial 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in the future related to follow on cta clinical trials  next generation orthovisc products  and other research and development programs in the pipeline  as well as from the impact of the implementation of stock option expensing in under sfas r 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower business development expenses and professional fees related to sarbanes oxley  which were partially offset by higher fees related to recruiting 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future related to headcount increases  recruiting costs  strategic planning efforts  and infrastructure expansion  as well as from the impact of implementation of stock option expensing in under sfas r 
interest income 
interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average available cash and invested balances during as well as increasing interest rates 
interest income in is expected to increase as a result of higher average cash and investment balances 
income taxes 
income tax provision for is  versus a net tax benefit of  recorded for the net benefit was comprised of a provision for income taxes of  offset by a  benefit resulting from the release of the valuation allowance 
as a result of the receipt of the  in milestone payments in from ortho biotech  our recent operating results  and forecasted future income  together supported an assertion that ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets was more likely than not at december  accordingly  the company fully released the valuation allowance during and correspondingly recorded a one time tax benefit of  or

under the terms of the b l agreement  which was replaced by the b l agreement in december  the price for all units sold for a calendar year was dependent on the total unit volume of sales of certain ophthalmic products during the year 
accordingly  unit prices for sales occurring in the nine months ended september  and were subject to possible retroactive price adjustments when the actual annual unit volume became known 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  the amount of revenue reasonably subject to the price adjustment was recorded as deferred revenue until the annual unit volume became known and the sales price becomes fixed

the increase in research and development expenses during was primarily attributable to expenditures associated with the pilot study for incert s initiated in april and the pivotal clinical trial for our product for cosmetic tissue augmentation initiated in may  including costs associated with the start up of the clinical trials incurred in the first quarter of the comparative increase in was partially offset by the elimination of costs primarily incurred in the first half of associated with the completion of our pivotal clinical trial for orthovisc 
in  our efforts were primarily related to incert  a product designed to prevent surgical adhesions and our products for the cta market 
our research and development efforts included seeking new applications for the ha molecule as well as our proprietary chemically modified ha and other therapeutics applications of our orthovisc formulation that target osteoarthritis related ailments 
selling  general and administrative

as a result of the carryback claim  in the first quarter of  we received a refund of approximately  of taxes paid in prior years 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures 
we expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as the scope of our operations expands 
historically we have funded our cash requirements from a combination of cash provided by operations  and available cash and investments on hand 
we expect that our existing capital resources  together with cash from operations and interest income  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million compared to million at december   and million at december  we received an initial payment of million in december upon entering into the jnj agreement

in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based at their fair values 
the provisions of this statement were effective for the company on january  the company has evaluated the provisions of this statement and determined it will have a material negative effect on consolidated net income 
we currently estimate that adoption of the statement will increase operating expenses by approximately  on a pre tax basis  for options granted through february   without forfeiture assumptions 
we expect additional grants for the remainder of will result in an additional  in operating expenses 
the amount will change based upon the number and value of actual stock option grants and forfeiture rates 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we have no material commitments for purchases of inventories 
we expect to incur additional investments in our operations related to capital expenditures in for cta manufacturing scale up and to meet anticipated higher volume requirements and for computers and software and furniture and fixtures associated with normal operations 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of orthovisc under the jnj agreement  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements beyond see the section captioned risk factors 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing may be made available to us or may be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations of non cancelable operating leases at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not utilize any derivative financial instruments  market risk sensitive instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of our investments consist of money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds that are carried on our books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalent is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure
