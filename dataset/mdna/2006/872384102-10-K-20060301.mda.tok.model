overview of business our corporate business strategy is to grow sustainable cash flow and cash distributions to our unitholders 
the key elements of our strategy are to focus on internal growth prospects in order to increase the pipeline system and terminal throughput  expand and upgrade existing assets and services and construct new pipelines  terminals and facilities  to target accretive and complementary acquisitions and expansion opportunities that provide attractive growth potential  to maintain an appropriate mix of assets  and to operate in a safe  efficient and environmentally responsible manner 
certain factors are key to our operations 
these include the safe  reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own or operate while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations 
we are also focused on our continued growth through expansion of the assets that we own and through the acquisition of assets that complement our current operations 
we operate and report in three business segments our downstream segment  which is engaged in the transportation and storage of refined products  lpgs and petrochemicals  our upstream segment  which is engaged in the gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  and our midstream segment  which is engaged in the gathering of natural gas  transportation of ngls and fractionation of ngls 
our downstream segment revenues are earned from transportation and storage of refined products and lpgs  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment are labor and electric power 
we generally realize higher revenues during the first and fourth quarters of each year since our operations are somewhat seasonal 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
our downstream segment also includes the results of operations of the northern portion of the dean pipeline  which transports rgp from mont belvieu to point comfort  texas 
our downstream segment also includes our equity investments in centennial and mb storage see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our upstream segment revenues are earned from gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating purchased crude oil along our pipeline systems  or from third party pipeline systems  and arranging the necessary transportation logistics for the ultimate sale of the crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
our upstream segment also includes our equity investment in seaway see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
seaway consists of large diameter pipelines that transport crude oil from seaway s marine terminals on the us gulf coast to cushing  oklahoma  a crude oil distribution point for the central united states  and to refineries in the texas city and houston areas 
our midstream segment revenues are earned from the gathering of natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming  through jonah  and the gathering of cbm and conventional natural gas in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado  through val verde  transportation of ngls from two trunkline ngl pipelines in south texas  two ngl pipelines in east texas and a pipeline system chaparral from west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu  and the fractionation of ngls in colorado 
we continued building a base for long term growth by enhancing existing systems and pursuing new business opportunities 
we increased throughput on our pipeline systems  constructed new pipeline and gathering systems  and expanded and upgraded our existing infrastructure 
in  our major accomplishments included substantially completing the phase iv expansion on the jonah system  increasing capacity to approximately billion cubic feet per day 
benefiting from a full year of revenues and volumes from the connection to a gathering system in colorado on val verde 
opening a refined products truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana  to provide the northwest louisiana and east texas markets with access to  additional barrels per day of delivery capacity of gulf coast sourced gasoline and diesel fuel 
expanding our gulf coast refined products infrastructure  which included the acquisition of a mile pipeline and million barrels of storage in the houston  texas  area 
continuing the expansion of our northeast lpgs pipeline system 
acquiring a refined products terminal and truck rack in north little rock  arkansas  to complement our existing infrastructure 
acquiring  barrels of crude oil storage in cushing  oklahoma  which provides additional terminaling and storage opportunities for mid continent refiners  and enables us to strengthen our gathering and marketing business 
integrating a mile crude oil pipeline in southeast texas into our south texas system  which will provide increased market flexibility for our customers and future growth opportunities 
in  we remain confident that our business strategy will provide continued growth in earnings and cash distributions 
this growth potential is based on continued development of the jonah system which serves the jonah and pinedale fields in our midstream segment  as we increase throughput on the jonah system with the completion of our phase iv expansion in february through the jonah expansion  we expect to increase the capacity to billion cubic feet per day  which should be completed in the fourth quarter of growth in our downstream segment  resulting from both our expanding gathering system capacity and the continued capacity of centennial  additional acquisitions and the growing demand for gulf coast sourced product 
centennial continues to provide us with additional system capacity to move additional refined products to the chicago  illinois  market areas 
substantially completing an expansion project to increase delivery capacity of gasoline and diesel fuel to the indianapolis  indiana  and chicago market areas 
strengthening our existing market base in our upstream segment  as we integrate our acquisitions into our existing asset base and concentrate on future acquisitions to expand our core operating areas 
continued growth in our upstream segment  resulting from expansions of our west texas systems and storage capacity at cushing 
adding new volumes and improving the operating efficiency of the val verde system in new mexico s san juan basin  through new connections of conventional and colorado coal seam gas 
increasing the throughput on our ngl systems 
our upstream segment s performance will be impacted by a decrease in our participation ratio in the revenue and expense of seaway  in accordance with the partnership agreement 
from june through may  we receive of revenue and expense of seaway 
thereafter  we will receive of revenue and expense of seaway 
on a pro rated basis  our share of revenue and expense of seaway will decrease to approximately for we expect to complete the sale of our ownership interest in the pioneer silica gel natural gas processing plant located in opal  wyoming  to enterprise by the middle of the proposed sale of the pioneer plant was initiated because it is not an integral part of our midstream segment operations  and natural gas processing is not a core business 
the anticipated sales proceeds would be used to fund organic growth projects  retire debt  or for other general partnership purposes 
the margin of the midstream segment  calculated as revenues generated from the processing arrangements at the jonah pioneer plant  less purchase of gas  will be reduced in as a result of the anticipated sale of the pioneer plant 
we do not expect that the sale of the pioneer plant will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we expect to expand the jonah system with a service date for such expansion being late we expect to enter into a joint venture agreement with enterprise relating to the construction and financing of the expansion 
enterprise will be responsible for all activities relating to the construction of the jonah expansion and will advance all amounts necessary to plan  engineer  construct or complete the jonah expansion anticipated to be approximately million 
such advance will constitute a subscription for an equity interest in the proposed joint venture 
we have the option to return to enterprise up to of the amount of the subscription 
if we return a portion of the subscription to enterprise  our relative interests in the proposed joint venture will be adjusted accordingly 
the proposed joint venture will terminate without liability to either party if we return of the subscription 
consistent with our business strategy  we continuously evaluate possible acquisitions of assets that would complement our current operations  including assets which  if acquired  would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
restatement of consolidated financial statements we are restating our previously reported consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and for the impact of the restated consolidated financial results for the quarterly periods during the years ended december  and  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that our method of accounting for the million excess investment in centennial  previously described as an intangible asset with an indefinite life  and the million excess investment in seaway  previously described as equity method goodwill  was incorrect 
through our accounting for these excess investments in centennial and seaway as intangible assets with indefinite lives and equity method goodwill  respectively  we have been testing the amounts for impairment on an annual basis as opposed to amortizing them over a determinable life 
we determined that it would be more appropriate to account for these excess investments as intangible assets with determinable lives 
as a result  we made non cash adjustments that reduced the net value of the excess investments in centennial and seaway  and increased amortization expense allocated to our equity earnings 
the effect of this restatement caused a million and million reduction to net income as previously reported for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the accounting correction  net income for the fiscal year ended december   includes a charge of million  of which million relates to the first nine months 
additionally  partners capital at december   reflects a million reduction representing the cumulative effect of this correction for fiscal years ended december  through while we believe the impacts of these non cash adjustments are not material to any previously issued financial statements  we determined that the cumulative adjustment for these non cash items was too material to record in the fourth quarter of  and therefore it was most appropriate to restate prior periods results 
these non cash adjustments had no effect on our operating income  compensation expense  debt balances or ability to meet all requirements related to our debt facilities 
the restatement had no impact on total cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
all amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted for this restatement 
we will continue to amortize the million excess investment in centennial related to a contract using units of production methodology over a year life 
the remaining million related to a pipeline will continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over years 
we will continue to amortize the million excess investment in seaway on a straight line basis over a year life related primarily to a pipeline 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  property  plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals based on estimates for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving certain third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
the delayed information from third parties includes  among other things  actual volumes of crude oil purchased  transported or sold  adjustments to inventory and invoices for purchases  actual natural gas and ngl deliveries and other operating expenses 
we make accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
most of the estimated accruals are reversed in the following month when actual information is received from third parties and our internal records have been reconciled 
the most difficult accruals to estimate are power costs  property taxes and crude oil margins 
power cost accruals generally involve a two to three month estimate  and the amount varies primarily for actual power usage 
power costs are dependent upon the actual volumes transported through our pipeline systems and the various power rates charged by numerous power companies along the pipeline system 
peak demand rates  which are difficult to predict  drive the variability of the power costs 
for the year ended december   approximately of our power costs were recorded using estimates 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for power costs would have an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
property tax accruals involve significant tax rate estimates in numerous jurisdictions 
actual property taxes are often not known until the tax bill is settled in subsequent periods  and the tax amount can vary for tax rate changes and changes in tax methods or elections 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for property taxes could have up to an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
crude oil margin estimates are based upon an average of the past twelve months of crude oil marketing volumes  factoring in current market events  and prices of crude oil 
we use an average of prices that were in effect during the applicable month to determine the expected revenue amount  and we determine the margin by evaluating the actual margins of the prior twelve months 
as of december   approximately of our annual crude oil margin is recorded using estimates 
a variance from this estimate of would impact the respective line items by approximately million on an annual basis 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition  because of the high volume  low margin nature of our business  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
variances from estimates are reflected in the period actual results become known  typically in the month following the estimate 
environmental costs at december   we have accrued a liability of million for our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites  costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs  as well as damages and other costs  when estimable 
we monitor the balance of accrued undiscounted environmental liabilities on a regular basis 
we record liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site when our liability for such costs is probable and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded  from time to time  to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of our ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for environmental costs would have an approximate million impact on annual earnings 
for information concerning environmental regulation and environmental costs and contingencies  see items and business and properties environmental and safety matters 
property  plant and equipment we regularly review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or changes include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for products in a market area  changes in competition and competitive practices  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future undiscounted net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
such estimates of future undiscounted net cash flows are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining useful lives can be recovered through undiscounted estimated future net cash flows of the acquired operations 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted estimated future operating cash flows 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of the estimated fair value to carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
based on our assessment  we do not believe our goodwill is impaired  and we have not recorded a charge from the adoption of sfas see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the recorded value of goodwill was million 
at december   we have million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  related to natural gas transportation contracts which were recorded as part of our acquisitions of jonah on september   and val verde on june  the value assigned to the natural gas transportation contracts required management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the assets acquired 
in connection with the acquisition of jonah  we assumed contracts that dedicate future production from natural gas wells in the green river basin in wyoming 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these production contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of val verde  we assumed fixed term gas transportation contracts with customers in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these fixed term contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is amortized on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system compared to the expected total throughput for the lives of the contracts 
on a quarterly basis  we update throughput estimates and evaluate the remaining expected useful life of the contract assets based upon the best available information 
a variance of in our aggregate production estimate for the jonah and val verde systems would have an approximate million impact on annual amortization expense 
changes in the estimated remaining production will impact the timing of amortization expense reported for future periods 
at december   we have million of excess investments  net of accumulated amortization  in our equity investments in centennial and seaway  which are being amortized over periods ranging from to years see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value assigned to our excess investment in centennial was created upon its formation 
approximately million is related to a contract and is being amortized on a unit of production basis based upon the volumes transported under the contract compared to the guaranteed total throughput of the contract over a year life 
the remaining million is related to a pipeline and is being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the pipeline  which is years 
the value assigned to our excess investment in seaway was created upon acquisition of our ownership interest in we are amortizing the million excess investment in seaway on a straight line basis over a year life related primarily to the life of the pipeline 
a variance of in our amortization expense allocated to equity earnings could have up to an approximate million impact on annual earnings

our downstream segment s results are dependent in large part on the demand for refined products and lpgs in the markets served by its pipelines 
reductions in that demand adversely affect the pipeline business of the downstream segment 
market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the products shipped in the downstream segment 
demand for gasoline  which in recent years has accounted for approximately forty percent of the downstream segment s refined products transportation revenues  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served in the downstream segment 
demand for distillates is affected by truck and railroad freight  the price of natural gas used by utilities  which use distillates as a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas is high  and usage for agricultural operations  which is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel  which in recent years has accounted for approximately twenty percent of the downstream segment s refined products revenues  depends on prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
propane deliveries are generally sensitive to the weather and meaningful year to year variances have occurred in the past and will likely continue to occur in the future 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from refined products transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  revenues from refined products transportation decreased primarily due to the recognition of million of deferred revenue in related to the expiration of two customer transportation agreements 
under some of our transportation agreements with customers  the contracts specify minimum payments for transportation services 
if the transportation services paid for are not used  the unused transportation service is recorded as deferred revenue 
the contracts generally specify a subsequent period of time in which the customer can transport excess products to recover the amount recorded as deferred revenue 
during the third quarter of  the time limit under two transportation agreements expired without the customers recovering the unused transportation services 
as a result  we recognized the deferred revenue as refined products revenue in that period 
additionally  refined products revenues decreased due to reduced deliveries of product as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september  as discussed below 
these decreases in revenues from refined products transportation resulting from the hurricanes were partially offset by an overall increase in the refined products volumes delivered primarily due to deliveries of products moved on centennial 
volume increases were due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
the refined products average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of greater growth in the volume of products delivered under a centennial tariff compared with the growth in deliveries under a teppco tariff  which resulted in an increased proportion of lower tariff barrels transported on our system 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement with centennial that increased our flexibility to deliver refined products to our market areas 
volumes transported on centennial increased due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
centennial has provided our system with additional pipeline capacity for products originating in the us gulf coast area 
prior to the construction of centennial  deliveries on our pipeline system were limited by our pipeline capacity  and transportation services for our customers were allocated in accordance with a proration policy 
with this incremental pipeline capacity  our previously constrained system has expanded deliveries in markets both south and north of creal springs  illinois 
revenues from lpgs transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to higher deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas due to system expansion projects completed in and colder winter weather in march and december prior year lpg transportation revenues were negatively impacted by a price spike in the mont belvieu propane price in late february  which resulted in teppco sourced propane being less competitive than propane from other source points 
the lpgs average rate per barrel increased from the prior period primarily as a result of a combination of decreased short haul deliveries and increased long haul propane deliveries during  and an increase in tariff rates which went into effect in july these increases were partially offset by reduced propane revenues resulting from decreased propane deliveries due to a propane release and fire at a dehydration unit in september at our todhunter storage facility  near middletown  ohio 
as a result of the propane release and fire  our lpg loading facilities at todhunter were shut down for approximately three weeks 
revenues from refined products and lpgs were also impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita  which affected the us gulf coast in august and september  respectively 
hurricane katrina disrupted refineries and other pipeline systems in the central us gulf coast  which provided us with additional deliveries at shreveport and arcadia  louisiana  as shippers used alternative sources to supply product to areas where normal distribution patterns were disrupted 
hurricane katrina also resulted in higher prices of refined products and lpgs  which had a negative impact on the current demand for the products 
hurricane rita disrupted production at western us gulf coast refineries  many of which directly supply us with product 
hurricane rita also disrupted power to our beaumont terminal  which resulted in the mainline being shut down for four days and centennial being shut down for ten days 
our  barrel per day capacity  inch diameter mainline system  which primarily delivers lpgs and gasoline from the texas gulf coast to the midwest  was pumping from mb storage s facility at approximately of normal operating capacity until mid october 
our  barrel per day capacity  inch and inch diameter pipelines  which primarily deliver distillates and gasoline from the texas gulf coast to the midwest  were pumping at approximately of normal operating capacity from our baytown  texas  terminal until mid october 
we installed generators at our beaumont  texas  facility  which enabled receipt and delivery of refined products out of tankage at the terminal 
commercial power was restored to the beaumont terminal and the newton  texas  pump station in mid october and full operations were resumed 
centennial resumed operating at its normal capacity on october  other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher refined products tender deduction  additive and loading fees  partially offset by lower propane inventory fees in lower volumes of product inventory sales in the period were partially offset by increased sales margin on the product inventory sales 
costs and expenses decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to decreased operating  general and administrative expenses and decreased depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by increased taxes other than income taxes  increased operating fuel and power and lower gains on the sales of assets in the period 
operating  general and administrative expenses decreased million primarily due to the following a million decrease in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program as we neared completion of the first cycle of our integrity management program  a million decrease in postretirement benefit accruals related to plan amendments see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  a million decrease in products losses  a million decrease in legal expenses related to a legal settlement in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and a million decrease in consulting services primarily related to acquisition related activities in the period 
these decreases to costs and expenses were partially offset by the following a million increase in labor and benefits expenses primarily associated with vesting provisions in certain of our compensation plans as a result of changes in ownership of our general partner  higher labor expenses associated with an increase in the number of employees between years and higher incentive compensation expense as a result of improved operating performance  a million increase in pipeline operating and maintenance expense  a million increase attributable to regulatory penalties for past incidents  a million increase in insurance expense  a million increase related to transition costs due to the changes in ownership of our general partner  a million increase in rental expense on a lease agreement from the centennial pipeline capacity lease agreement and an increase in other miscellaneous general and administrative supplies expenses during the year  including a million increase in environmental assessment and remediation expenses  a million increase in labor and benefits expense related to retirement plan settlements with defs and hurricane related expenses 
depreciation expense decreased million primarily due to a million non cash impairment charge in the third quarter of  partially offset by a million write off of assets related to the propane release and fire at a storage facility in ohio see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  assets placed into service and assets retired to depreciation expense in the period 
taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily due to asset acquisitions and a higher tax base in the period 
operating fuel and power expense increased million primarily as a result of increased volumes and higher power rates during the period 
during the year ended december   we recognized net gains of million from the sales of various assets in the downstream segment 
net losses from equity investments decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as shown below in thousands years ended december  increase decrease as restated centennial mb storage other total equity losses equity losses in centennial decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher transportation revenues and volumes 
equity earnings in mb storage decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense and higher general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher rental and storage revenues and volumes 
mb storage was impacted by hurricane rita  which reduced revenues and increased operating expenses 
additionally  in april  mb storage acquired storage and pipeline assets and contracts for approximately million  of which te products contributed million 
increases in storage revenue  shuttle revenue  rental revenue and depreciation and amortization expense for year ended december   compared with the year ended december   are primarily related to the acquired storage assets and contracts 
for the year ended december   te products received the first million per quarter or million on an annual basis of mb storage s income before depreciation expense  as defined in the operating agreement 
for the year ended december   te products received the first million per quarter or million on an annual basis of mb storage s income before depreciation expense 
te products share of mb storage s earnings is adjusted annually by the partners of mb storage 
any amount of mb storage s annual income before depreciation expense in excess of million for and million for is allocated evenly between te products and louis dreyfus 
depreciation expense on assets each party originally contributed to mb storage is allocated between te products and louis dreyfus based on the net book value of the assets contributed 
depreciation expense on assets constructed or acquired by mb storage subsequent to formation is allocated evenly between te products and louis dreyfus 
for the years ended december   and  te products sharing ratio in the earnings of mb storage was approximately  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from refined products transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  refined products transportation revenues increased primarily due to higher market based tariff rates which went into effect in july and may and a shift in the distribution of product moved by us to favor longer haul  higher tariff movements 
these changes resulted in a increase in the refined products average rate per barrel from the prior year and offset the effect of a decrease in refined products delivery volumes 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement with centennial that increased our flexibility to deliver refined products to our market areas 
volumes transported on centennial increased due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
refined products transportation revenues also increased due to the recognition of million of deferred revenue in the period related to the expiration of two customer transportation agreements 
revenues from lpgs transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of additionally  in late february  the mont belvieu propane price spiked  which resulted in teppco sourced propane being less competitive than propane from other source points 
also contributing to the decrease were less favorable price differentials between mont belvieu and other supply centers during the second and third quarters of high propane prices in also reduced the summer and early fall fill of consumer storage of propane during these decreases were partially offset by increased deliveries of isobutane to chicago area refineries and increased short haul propane deliveries to us gulf coast petrochemical customers 
the lpgs average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year period primarily as a result of increased short haul deliveries during other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher propane inventory fees  higher margins on product inventory sales  higher revenue from our providence  rhode island import facility and higher refined products tender deduction  loading and custody transfer revenues 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating  general and administrative expenses  increased depreciation and amortization expense and increased operating fuel and power  partially offset by net gains on the sales of assets 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a million increase in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program  a million increase in legal accruals related to the settlement of a lawsuit see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  a million increase in rental expense from the centennial pipeline capacity lease agreement that we entered into in february  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a million increase in costs related to unsuccessful acquisition evaluations 
these increases were partially offset by million of lower expenses in the period associated with the write off of receivables related to customer bankruptcies and non payments in depreciation expense increased from the prior year period because of a million charge resulting from the impairment of marine assets in the beaumont area see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million in assets taken out of service during the period to depreciation expense 
depreciation expense also increased approximately million as a result of assets placed in service during and  partially offset by an increase in the estimated remaining life of a section of our pipeline system in the northeast  resulting from pipeline capital improvements made as part of our integrity management program 
operating fuel and power expense increased primarily as a result of higher power rates during the period 
in addition  we recognized net gains of million during from the sales of various assets in the downstream segment 
net losses from equity investments decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as shown below in thousands years ended december  increase as restated as restated centennial mb storage other total equity losses equity losses in centennial decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased transportation revenues and volumes and lower operating expenses 
during  we acquired an additional interest in centennial on february   bringing te products ownership interest to 
included in the equity loss for the year ended december   is million of equity income relating to the settlement of certain transmix matters recognized in previous periods 
equity earnings in mb storage increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  in april  mb storage acquired storage and pipeline assets and contracts for approximately million  of which te products contributed million 
the increase in equity earnings is due to increased storage revenue  shuttle revenue and rental revenue primarily from the acquired contracts and lower pipeline rehabilitation expenses on the mb storage system  partially offset by increased amortization and depreciation expense on storage assets and contracts acquired 
other income net increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash investments and higher interest income earned on a capital lease 
upstream segment the following table provides financial information for the upstream segment for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  increase decrease as restated as restated sales of petroleum products transportation crude oil other total operating revenues purchases of petroleum products operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes gains on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income equity earnings other income net earnings before interest information presented in the following table includes the margin of the upstream segment  which may be viewed as a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measure under the rules of the sec 
we calculate the margin of the upstream segment as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
we believe that margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than sales and purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil due to the significant fluctuations in sales and purchases caused by variations in the level of volumes marketed and prices for products marketed 
additionally  we use margin internally to evaluate the financial performance of the upstream segment as we believe margin is a better indicator of performance than operating income as operating  general and administrative expenses  operating fuel and power and depreciation expense are not directly related to the margin activities 
margin and volume information for the years ended december   and is presented below in thousands  except per barrel and per gallon amounts years ended december  percentage increase decrease margins crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil sales total margin total barrels crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil volume total gallons margin per barrel crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil margin per gallon margins in this table are presented prior to the elimination of intercompany sales  revenues and purchases between tco and tcpl 
the following table reconciles the upstream segment margin to operating income in the consolidated statements of income using the information presented in the tables above  in the consolidated statements of income and in the statements of income in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands years ended december  as restated as restated sales of petroleum products transportation crude oil less purchases of petroleum products total margin other operating revenues total operating revenues operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes gains on sales of assets operating income year ended december  compared with year ended december  our margin increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil marketing margin increased million primarily due to increased volumes marketed primarily due to asset acquisitions  partially offset by increased transportation costs 
crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to increased transportation volumes and revenues on our south texas system due to the acquisition of crude oil pipeline assets in april and higher revenues on our west texas systems resulting from organic growth projects on the systems and benefits realized from assets acquired at cushing 
the average margin per barrel increased primarily due to movements of volumes on higher tariff segments  including higher tariffs on the assets acquired from bp in april lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased sales of lubrication oils and chemicals and the acquisitions of lubrication oil distributors in casper  wyoming  in august  and in dumas  texas  in august crude oil terminaling margin increased million as a result of increased pumpover volumes at cushing  oklahoma  partially offset by decreased pumpover volumes at midland  texas 
other operating revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a million favorable settlement of inventory imbalances in the first quarter of and lower revenues from documentation and other services to support customers trading activity at midland and cushing in costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating  general and administrative expenses  increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased taxes other than income taxes and lower gains on sales of assets in the period  partially offset by decreased operating fuel and power 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year period as a result of the following a million increase in pipeline operating and maintenance expense primarily due to acquisitions and the continued integration of the genesis assets into our system  a million increase in labor and benefits expense related to vesting provisions in certain of our compensation plans as a result of changes in ownership of our general partner  an increase in the number of employees between periods  and higher incentive compensation expense as a result of improved operating performance  a million settlement of an indemnity related to a past acquisition  a million increase in transition charges as a result of changes in ownership of our general partner  a million increase in bad debt expense primarily related to a customer nonpayment  a million increase in operating costs for our undivided ownership interest in basin pipeline  a million increase related to a legal settlement and increases in miscellaneous administrative supplies and expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in product measurement losses  a million decrease in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program and a million decrease in environmental assessment and remediation costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million primarily as a result of a million non cash impairment charge in the third quarter of  resulting from the impairment of two crude oil systems see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation expense also increased as a result of assets placed in service and assets retired to depreciation expense during the period 
taxes other than income taxes increased million due to asset acquisitions and a higher asset base in the period 
during the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million from the sale of our remaining interest in the original rancho pipeline system see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating fuel and power decreased million primarily as a result of lower transportation volumes in equity earnings from our investment in seaway decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher operating  general and administrative expenses related to a pipeline release in may discussed below  higher power costs  decreased gains on inventory sales  higher depreciation expense and a favorable settlement in the first quarter of with a former owner of seaway s crude oil assets regarding inventory imbalances that were not acquired by us  partially offset by higher long haul transportation volumes 
after seaway s pipeline release in may  the maximum operating pressure on the pipeline system was reduced by until the cause of the failure is determined and any required corrective measures are implemented 
a study of the failed pipe was performed by independent  metallurgical experts who determined that the pipe failed due to damage that occurred during rail shipment associated with its installation thirty years ago 
the corrective actions include running a very sophisticated  high definition inspection tool through the pipe to determine if there are any other sections of pipe that have similar damage 
this approach is consistent with directives from the united states department of transportation s office of pipeline safety in past failures of this type 
the inspection tool has been run and the resulting data is currently being analyzed 
we expect seaway to be operating at reduced maximum pressures through the second quarter of as a result of operating at reduced maximum pressures  during the third quarter of  we began using a drag reducing agent to increase the flow of product through the pipeline system 
the drag reducing agent allowed us to maintain the higher volumes transported  but also increased our operating costs 
at this time  we do not believe the reduced pressures will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our margin increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to an increase in transportation volumes and revenues on our south texas and red river systems 
our basin system also had increased transportation volumes and revenues primarily due to the expansion of the system between midland  texas  and wichita falls  texas  resulting in an additional capacity of ten thousand barrels per day on the system  and movements of barrels on higher tariff segments 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of crude supply and transportation assets genesis  which have been integrated into our south texas system see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased sales of chemical volumes and increased volumes related to the acquisitions of lubrication oil distributors in abilene  texas  in december and in casper  wyoming  in august crude oil marketing margin increased million as a result of increased volumes marketed  partially offset by an unfavorable invoicing settlement on a marketing contract in the first quarter of  which reduced the marketing margin in  and increased transportation costs 
crude oil terminaling margin remained unchanged as a result of higher pumpover volumes at cushing  oklahoma  offset by lower pumpover volumes at midland  texas 
other operating revenues of the upstream segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a million favorable settlement of inventory imbalances  and higher revenues from documentation and other services to support customers trading activity at midland and cushing 
costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased operating fuel and power  increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased operating  general and administrative expenses and increased taxes other than income taxes 
operating fuel and power increased million primarily as a result of the acquisition of the genesis assets and higher volumes in depreciation and amortization expense increased million primarily due to the assets acquired from genesis 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year primarily due to a million increase in pipeline inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program  a million increase in expenses related to the genesis acquisition  a million increase in labor and benefits expense related to incentive compensation plans and an increase in the number of employees between periods  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and a million increase in rental expense due to our pipeline lease at freeport  texas  with seaway 
these increases were partially offset by million of higher environmental assessment and remediation costs in  million of expense in from the net settlement of crude oil imbalances with customers  million of higher legal costs in related to the litigation and settlement with drd environmental services  inc and million of lower expenses in from the sale of the rancho assets in taxes other than income taxes increased million due to increases in property tax accruals 
in june  we recorded a net gain of million  included in the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statements of income  on the sale of certain of the assets of the rancho pipeline 
during the year ended december   we recorded net gains of million  included in the gains on sales of assets in our consolidated statements of income  primarily related to the sale of our remaining interest in the original rancho pipeline system see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
equity earnings from our investment in seaway increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to higher transportation volumes  gains on crude oil inventory sales  a settlement with a former owner of seaway s crude oil assets regarding inventory imbalances that were not acquired by us and lower operating  general and administrative expenses 
midstream segment the following table provides financial information for the midstream segment for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  increase decrease sales of petroleum products gathering natural gas transportation ngls other total operating revenues purchases of petroleum products operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes gains on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income other income net earnings before interest the following table presents volume and average rate information for the years ended december   and in thousands  except average fee and average rate amounts years ended december  percentage increase decrease gathering natural gas jonah million cubic feet mmcf billion british thermal units mmmbtu average fee per million british thermal unit mmbtu gathering natural gas val verde mmcf mmmbtu average fee per mmbtu transportation ngls thousand barrels average rate per barrel fractionation ngls thousand barrels average rate per barrel sales condensate thousand barrels average rate per barrel information presented in the following discussion includes the margin of the midstream segment  which may be viewed as a non gaap financial measure under the rules of the sec 
we calculate the margin of the midstream segment as revenues generated from the processing arrangements at the jonah pioneer plant  less purchases of gas 
pioneer s processing agreements allow jonah to retain and sell the ngls extracted during the process and deliver to producers the residue gas equivalent in energy to the natural gas received from the producers 
jonah sells the ngls it retains and purchases gas to replace the equivalent energy removed in the liquids 
we believe that margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than sales and purchases of petroleum products due to the significant fluctuations in sales and purchases caused by variations in the level of volumes marketed and prices for products marketed 
additionally  we use margin internally to evaluate the financial performance of the midstream segment s processing activities as we believe margin is a better indicator of performance than operating income as operating  general and administrative expenses  operating fuel and power and depreciation expense are not directly related to the margin activities 
the following table reconciles the midstream segment margin to operating income in the consolidated statements of income using the information presented in the tables above  in the consolidated statements of income and in the statements of income in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands years ended december  sales of petroleum products less purchases of petroleum products total margin gathering natural gas transportation ngls other operating revenues total operating revenues operating  general and administrative operating fuel and power depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes gains on sales of assets operating income year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from the gathering of natural gas increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  natural gas gathering revenues from the jonah system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to the expansion of the jonah system in installation of additional capacity of million cubic feet per day was completed during the fourth quarter of jonah s average natural gas gathering rate per mmcf decreased due to higher system wellhead pressures 
natural gas gathering revenues from the val verde system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to increased volumes from two new connections made to the val verde system in may and december  partially offset by the natural decline of cbm production 
val verde s average natural gas gathering rate per mmcf decreased due to contracts entered into relating to the new connections  which have lower rates than the existing val verde system s average rates 
margin sales of petroleum products less purchases of petroleum products resulting from the processing arrangements at the jonah pioneer plant increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased volumes and higher ngl prices 
jonah s pioneer gas processing plant was completed during the first quarter of  as a part of the phase iii expansion to increase the processing capacity in southwestern wyoming 
pioneer s processing agreements allow the producers to elect annually whether to be charged under a fee based arrangement or a fee plus keep whole arrangement 
under the fee based election  jonah receives a fee for its processing services 
under the fee plus keep whole election  jonah receives a lower fee for its processing services  retains and sells the ngls extracted during the process and delivers to producers the residue gas equivalent in energy to the natural gas received from the producers 
jonah sells the ngls it retains and purchases gas to replace the equivalent energy removed in the liquids 
for the and periods  the producers elected the fee plus keep whole arrangement 
revenues from the transportation of ngls increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased volumes transported on the chaparral  panola and dean pipelines  partially offset by decreased volumes transported on the wilcox pipeline 
the increase in the ngl transportation average rate per barrel resulted from a higher average rate per barrel on volumes transported on the panola pipeline offset by a lower average rate per barrel on the chaparral pipeline 
other operating revenues remained unchanged for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  val verde s other operating revenues increased million due to revenues generated as a result of contractual producer minimum fuel levels exceeding actual operating fuel usage during val verde retains a portion of its producers gas to compensate for fuel used in operations 
the actual usage of gas can differ from the amount contractually retained from producers 
value retained from producers or sales generated as a result of efficient fuel usage are recognized as other operating revenues 
jonah s processing fee revenue and other operating revenues increased million as a result of the expansion of the jonah system and higher volumes 
ngl fractionation revenues increased million as a result of higher volumes 
other operating revenues on chaparral decreased million primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue related to an inventory settlement in the prior year period 
costs and expenses excluding purchases of petroleum products decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to decreased depreciation and amortization expense  decreased operating  general and administrative expenses  decreased taxes other than income taxes and a net gain recorded on the sale of an asset  partially offset by increased operating fuel and power 
amortization expense on the jonah system decreased million primarily due to a million decrease related to revisions to the estimated life of intangible assets under the units of production method  partially offset by a million increase as a result of higher volumes in amortization expense on the val verde system increased million primarily due to a million increase related to revisions to the estimated life of intangible assets under the units of production method  partially offset by a million decrease as a result of lower volumes in on contracts included in the intangible assets  resulting from the natural decline in cbm production

operating  general and administrative expenses decreased million from the prior year period as a result a million decrease in gas settlement expenses  a million decrease in a operating expenses primarily related to val verde and a million decrease in inspection and repair costs associated with our integrity management program 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in labor and benefits expense primarily associated with vesting provisions in certain of our compensation plans and with certain defs employees becoming employees of epco  a million increase in transition expenses as a result of changes in ownership of our general partner  a million increase in insurance expense and increases in various general and administrative supplies and expenses 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million as a result of adjustments to property tax accruals 
operating fuel and power increased million compared to the prior year due to adjustments to the fuel and power accrual in the prior year period  partially offset by increased expenses in related to higher transportation volumes 
a net gain of million was recognized on the sale of equipment in the current period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues from the gathering of natural gas increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  natural gas gathering revenues from the jonah system increased million and volumes gathered increased bcf for the year ended december   due to the expansion of the jonah system during the phase iii expansion was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of and increased system capacity from mmcf day to  mmcf day 
the increase in jonah s revenues was also partially due to higher gathering rates realized due to lower system pressures resulting from the increased capacity provided by the phase iii expansion 
natural gas gathering revenues from the val verde system decreased million and volumes gathered decreased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to the natural decline of cbm production and slower than anticipated completion and connection of infill wells  partially offset by increased volumes from two new connections made to the val verde system in may and december val verde s average natural gas gathering rate per mmcf decreased due to contracts entered into relating to the new connections  which have lower rates than the existing val verde system s average rates 
for the year ended december   the sales and purchases under the fee arrangements at the pioneer plant resulted in a margin sales of petroleum products less purchases of petroleum products of million 
revenues from the transportation of ngls increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased volumes transported on the chaparral and panola pipelines  partially offset by decreased volumes on the dean and wilcox pipelines

other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  processing fee revenues increased million as a result of jonah s pioneer processing plant  which was constructed as part of the phase iii expansion and placed in service in january jonah s other operating revenues also increased million primarily due to higher condensate sales 
other operating revenues on chaparral increased million due to the recognition of deferred revenue related to an inventory settlement 
val verde s operating revenues increased million due to revenues generated as a result of contractual producer minimum fuel levels exceeding actual operating fuel usage during the year ended december  costs and expenses excluding purchases of petroleum products increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increases in operating  general and administrative expense  operating fuel and power and taxes other than income taxes  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
operating  general and administrative expense increased due to a million increase in gas settlement expenses  a million increase in general and administrative labor expense  a million increase in consulting and contract services related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  a million increase related to our integrity management program and a million increase related to jonah s processing plant which began operations in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in expense related to the sale of our enron corp 
receivable  which had been fully reserved in  and a million decrease in maintenance expenditures at val verde 
operating fuel and power increased million  primarily due to higher variable power rates and increased ngl volumes transported during times of peak variable power rates 
depreciation expense increased million  primarily as a result of assets placed in service in related to the expansion of the jonah system and additional well connections on the val verde system in taxes other than income taxes increased million as a result of higher property balances 
amortization expense decreased million primarily due to revisions to the estimated life of jonah s intangible assets under the units of production method  partially offset by a million increase as a result of higher volumes in the period 
in second quarter  jonah s estimated total throughput of the system was adjusted  which resulted in an extension of the expected amortization period from years to years 
during the fourth quarter of  additional limited production forecasts were obtained from some of the producers on the jonah system related to future expansions of the system  and as a result  we again increased our best estimate of future throughput on the jonah system 
this increase in the estimate of future throughput extended the amortization period of jonah s natural gas gathering contracts see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization expense on the val verde system decreased million primarily due to lower volumes in the period  resulting from the natural decline in cbm production 
other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
interest expense and capitalized interest year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings and higher short term floating interest rates on our revolving credit facility and million of expense related to the termination of a treasury lock see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by a higher percentage of fixed interest rate debt during the year ended december   that carried a higher rate of interest as compared with floating interest rate debt 
the higher percentage of fixed interest rate debt resulted from an interest rate swap that expired in april see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized interest increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to interest capitalized on higher construction work in progress balances in year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to a higher percentage of variable interest rate debt during the year ended december   that carried a lower rate of interest as compared to fixed interest rate debt 
the higher percentage of variable interest rate debt resulted from the expiration of an interest rate swap in april see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease was partially offset by higher balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility in capitalized interest decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to interest capitalized on higher construction work in progress balances in financial condition and liquidity cash generated from operations  credit facilities and debt and equity offerings are our primary sources of liquidity

other considerations universal shelf we have filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to agreement on terms at the time of use and appropriate supplementation  allows us to issue  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate of billion of equity securities  debt securities or a combination thereof 
in the may equity offering  we issued million of equity securities 
at december   we had billion available under this shelf registration  subject to customary marketing terms and conditions 
credit facilities we have in place an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to million revolving credit facility  which may be increased up to a maximum of million upon our request  subject to lender approval and the satisfaction of certain other conditions 
the revolving credit facility expires on december  interest is payable at an applicable margin above either the lender s base rate or libor 
at december   million was outstanding under the facility  and we had million of availability under the most restrictive financial covenant 
restrictive covenants in the credit agreement limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make distributions in excess of available cash see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and complete mergers  acquisitions and sales of assets 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  which we were in compliance with at december  future capital needs and commitments we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million including million of capitalized interest 
we expect to spend approximately million for revenue generating projects

we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  including life cycle replacements for equipment at various facilities and pipeline and tank replacements among all of our business segments 
we expect to spend approximately million to improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs among all of our business segments 
during  te products may be required to contribute cash to centennial to cover capital expenditures  acquisitions or other operating needs and to mb storage to cover significant capital expenditures or additional acquisitions 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business operations 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
the construction of the jonah expansion is expected to be completed through a proposed joint venture between us and enterprise  relating to the construction and financing of the jonah expansion 
enterprise will be responsible for all activities relating to the construction of the jonah expansion and will advance all amounts necessary to plan  engineer  construct or complete the jonah expansion anticipated to be approximately million 
such advance will constitute a subscription for an equity interest in the proposed joint venture 
we expect the jonah expansion to be put into service in late we have the option to return to enterprise up to of the amount of the subscription 
if we return a portion of the subscription to enterprise  our relative interests in the proposed joint venture will be adjusted accordingly 
the proposed joint venture will terminate without liability to either party if we return of the subscription 
liquidity outlook we believe that we will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating and investing activities 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  capital expenditures to sustain existing operations and to complete the jonah expansion  revenue generating expenditures  interest payments on our senior notes and revolving credit facility  distributions to our general partner and unitholders and acquisitions of new assets or businesses 
our cash requirements for are expected to be funded through operating cash flows and our arrangement with enterprise under the pending joint venture agreement related to the jonah expansion 
long term cash requirements for expansion projects  acquisitions and debt repayments are expected to be funded by several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities  joint ventures and possibly the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and our credit rating at the time 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not rely on off balance sheet borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
we have no off balance sheet commitments for indebtedness other than the limited guaranty of centennial debt and the limited guarantee of centennial catastrophic events as discussed below 
in addition  we have entered into various leases covering assets utilized in several areas of our operations 
centennial entered into credit facilities totaling million  and as of december   million was outstanding under those credit facilities 
te products and marathon have each guaranteed one half of the repayment of centennial s outstanding debt balance plus interest under a long term credit agreement  which expires in  and a short term credit agreement  which expires in the guarantees arose in order for centennial to obtain adequate financing  and the proceeds of the credit agreements were used to fund construction and conversion costs of its pipeline system 
prior to the expiration of the long term credit agreement  te products could be relinquished from responsibility under the guarantee should centennial meet certain financial tests 
if centennial defaults on its outstanding balance  the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments for te products and marathon is million each at december  te products  marathon and centennial have entered into a limited cash call agreement  which allows each member to contribute cash in lieu of centennial procuring separate insurance in the event of a third party liability arising from a catastrophic event 
there is an indefinite term for the agreement and each member is to contribute cash in proportion to its ownership interest  up to a maximum of million each 
as a result of the catastrophic event guarantee  te products has recorded a million obligation  which represents the present value of the estimated amount that we would have to pay under the guarantee 
if a catastrophic event were to occur and we were required to contribute cash to centennial  contributions exceeding our deductible might be covered by our insurance 
one of our subsidiaries  tco  has entered into master equipment lease agreements with finance companies for the use of various equipment 
we have guaranteed the full and timely payment and performance of tco s obligations under the agreements 
generally  events of default would trigger our performance under the guarantee 
the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is not estimable  but would include base rental payments for both current and future equipment  stipulated loss payments in the event any equipment is stolen  damaged  or destroyed and any future indemnity payments 
we carry insurance coverage that may offset any payments required under the guarantees

our te products subsidiary entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its senior notes due at december   the senior notes include an adjustment to decrease the fair value of the debt by million related to this interest rate swap agreement 
we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes due at december   the senior notes include a deferred gain  net of amortization  from previous interest rate swap terminations of million 
at december   our senior notes  our senior notes and our senior notes include million of unamortized debt discounts 
the fair value adjustments  the deferred gain adjustment and the unamortized debt discounts are excluded from this table 
includes interest payments due on our senior notes and interest payments and commitment fees due on our revolving credit facility 
the interest amount calculated on the revolving credit facility is based on the assumption that the amount outstanding and the interest rate charged both remain at their current levels 
includes a pipeline capacity lease with centennial 
in january  te products entered into a pipeline capacity lease agreement with centennial for a period of five years that contains a minimum throughput requirement 
for the year ended december   te products exceeded the minimum throughput requirements on the lease agreement 
includes accruals for costs incurred but not yet paid relating to capital projects 
excludes approximately million of long term deferred revenue payments  which are being transferred to income over the term of the respective revenue contracts and million related to our estimated amount of obligation under a catastrophic event guarantee for centennial 
the amount of commitment by year is our best estimate of projected payments of these long term liabilities 
at december   we had an million standby letter of credit in connection with crude oil purchases in the fourth quarter of this amount will be paid during the first quarter of we expect to repay the long term  senior unsecured obligations and bank debt through the issuance of additional long term senior unsecured debt at the time the   and debt matures  issuance of additional equity  with proceeds from dispositions of assets  cash flow from operations or any combination of the above items 
in addition to the items in the table above  we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing  transportation  terminaling and storage of crude oil 
the majority of contractual commitments we make for the purchase of crude oil range in term from a thirty day evergreen to one year 
a substantial portion of the contracts for the purchase of crude oil that extend beyond thirty days include cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with thirty days written notice 
during the year ended december   crude oil purchases averaged approximately million per month 
our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb by standard and poors s p and baa by moody s investors service moody s 
s p assigned this rating on june   following its review of the ownership structure  corporate governance issues  and proposed funding after the acquisition of the general partner by dfi 
both ratings are with a stable outlook 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any indebtedness 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it determines that the circumstances warrant such a change

both ratings are with a stable outlook 
recent accounting pronouncements see discussion of new accounting pronouncements in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in crude oil commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not have foreign exchange risks 
our risk management committee has established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
the risk management committee is comprised  in part  of senior executives of the company 
we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
on the majority of our crude oil derivative contracts  we take the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
on a small portion of our crude oil marketing business  we enter into derivative contracts such as swaps and other business hedging devices for which we cannot take the normal purchase and normal sale exclusion 
generally  hedge accounting is elected 
the terms of these contracts are typically one year or less 
the purpose is to balance our position or lock in a margin and  as such  the derivative contracts do not expose us to additional significant market risk 
for derivatives where hedge accounting is elected  the effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as such transactions are settled 
for derivatives where hedge accounting is not elected  we mark these transactions to market and the changes in the fair value are recognized in current earnings 
this results in some financial statement variability during quarterly periods  however  any unrealized gains and losses reflected in the financial statements related to marking these transactions to market are offset by realized gains and losses in different quarterly periods when the transactions are settled 
at december   we had a limited number of commodity derivatives that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
gains and losses on these derivatives are offset against corresponding gains or losses of the hedged item and are deferred through other comprehensive income  thus minimizing exposure to cash flow risk 
the fair value of the open positions at december  was million 
assuming a hypothetical across the board price decrease in the forward curve  the change in fair value of the hedging instrument would have been million 
at december   we had a limited number of commodity derivatives where the transactions were marked to market because hedge accounting was not elected 
the fair value of the open positions at december  was million 
the fair value of the open positions was based upon both quoted market prices obtained from nymex and were estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications  brokers and marketers 
the fair values were determined based upon the differences by month between the fixed contract price and the relevant forward price curve  the volumes for the applicable month and a discount rate of 
interest rate risk at december   we had million outstanding under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate is based  at our option  on either the lender s base rate plus a spread or libor plus a spread in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bimonthly  quarterly or semiannually 
utilizing the balances of our variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   and assuming market interest rates increase basis points  the potential annual increase in interest expense would be million 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the senior notes as of december  and in millions fair value face december  value te products senior notes  due january senior notes  due february senior notes  due february te products senior notes  due january we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our cash flow and fair value risks 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps that manage our cash flow risk reduce our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rates underlying variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps that manage our fair value risks are intended to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt 
interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is included as an adjustment to accrued interest 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate underlying our variable rate revolving credit facility 
this interest rate swap matured in april we designated this swap agreement  which hedged exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributed to changes in interest rates  as a cash flow hedge 
the swap agreement was based on a notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  we paid a fixed rate of interest of and received a floating rate based on a three month us dollar libor rate 
because this swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value  to the extent the swap was effective  were recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged interest costs were recognized in earnings 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized an increase in interest expense of million and million  respectively  related to the difference between the fixed rate and the floating rate of interest on the interest rate swap 
in october  te products entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior notes due we designated this swap agreement as a fair value hedge 
the swap agreement has a notional amount of million and matures in january to match the principal and maturity of the te products senior notes 
under the swap agreement  te products pays a floating rate of interest based on a three month us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and receives a fixed rate of interest of 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized reductions in interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  related to the difference between the fixed rate and the floating rate of interest on the interest rate swap 
during the years ended december   and  we measured the hedge effectiveness of this interest rate swap and noted that no gain or loss from ineffectiveness was required to be recognized 
the fair value of this interest rate swap was a loss of approximately million at december   and a gain of approximately million at december  utilizing the balance of the te products senior notes outstanding at december  and including the effects of hedging activities  assuming market interest rates increase basis points  the potential annual increase in interest expense is million 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes due the swap agreements had a combined notional amount of million and matured in to match the principal and maturity of the senior notes 
under the swap agreements  we paid a floating rate of interest based on a us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and received a fixed rate of interest of 
these swap agreements were later terminated in resulting in gains of million 
the gains realized from the swap terminations have been deferred as adjustments to the carrying value of the senior notes and are being amortized using the effective interest method as reductions to future interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
at december   the unamortized balance of the deferred gains was million 
in the event of early extinguishment of the senior notes  any remaining unamortized gains would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income at the time of extinguishment 
during may  we executed a treasury rate lock agreement with a notional amount of million to hedge our exposure to increases in the treasury rate that was to be used to establish the fixed interest rate for a debt offering that was proposed to occur in the second quarter of during june  the proposed debt offering was cancelled  and the treasury lock was terminated with a realized loss of million 
the realized loss was recorded as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
in january  we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million  whereby we will receive a floating rate of interest and will pay a fixed rate of interest for a two year term 
these interest rate swaps were executed to decrease the exposure to potential increases in floating interest rates 
using the balances of outstanding debt at december   these interest rate swaps decrease the level of floating interest rate debt from to of total outstanding debt
