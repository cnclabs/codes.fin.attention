worthington steel is one of america s largest independent intermediate processors of flat rolled steel 
it occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications 
these products typically cannot be supplied as efficiently by steel mills or steel end users 
the steel processing segment owns and operates eight manufacturing facilities  one each located in alabama  indiana  kentucky  maryland and michigan  and three located in ohio 
the consolidated joint venture  spartan steel coating  llc spartan  owns and operates a manufacturing facility in michigan 

table of contents worthington steel serves approximately  customers from these facilities  principally in the automotive  construction  lawn and garden  hardware  furniture  office equipment  electrical control  leisure and recreation  appliance  farm implements  hvac  container  and aerospace markets 
no single customer represented greater than of net sales for the steel processing segment during fiscal worthington steel buys coils of steel from major integrated steel mills and mini mills and processes them to the precise type  thickness  length  width  shape  temper and surface quality required by customer specifications 
computer aided processing capabilities include  among others pickling  a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot rolled steel  slitting  which cuts steel to specific widths  cold reduction  which achieves close tolerances of thickness and temper by rolling  hot dipped galvanizing  which coats steel with zinc and zinc alloys through a hot dipped process  hydrogen annealing  a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel  cutting to length  which cuts flattened steel to exact lengths  tension leveling  a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances for steel  edging  which conditions the edges of the steel by imparting round  smooth or knurled edges  non metallic coatings including dry lube  acrylic and paint  and configured blanking  which stamps steel into specific shapes 
worthington steel also toll processes steel for steel mills  large end users  service centers  and other processors 
toll processing is different from typical steel processing because the mill  end user  or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product 
toll processing enhances worthington steel s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders  which is a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors 
the steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
there are many competitors  including other independent intermediate processors 
competition is primarily on the basis of product quality  ability to meet delivery requirements  and price 
technical service and support for material testing and customer specific applications enhance the quality of products see item business technical services 
however  the extent to which technical service capability has improved worthington steel s competitive position has not been quantified 
worthington steel s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is  in part  based on the proximity of facilities to customers  suppliers  and one another 
the extent to which plant location has impacted worthington steel s competitive position has not been quantified 
processed steel products are priced competitively  primarily based on market factors  including  among other things  the cost and availability of raw materials  transportation and shipping costs  and overall economic conditions in the united states and abroad
