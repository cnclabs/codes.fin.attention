item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems and application software  which we sell standalone or in combination with our own vision guidance technology and or our third parties robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is key differentiator for adept 
in addition  we provide robotics services and support for both our own customers and the installed base of other third party providers  which provides us with additional opportunities for revenue growth 
we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
through direct sales to companies  oem and via our systems integrators  adept provides a suite of cost effective robotics systems and services to the consumer and computer electronics  disk drive  machine tool automation  automotive electronics  food  consumer goods  medical devices and pharmaceuticals industries 
in addition  we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who resell our products as part of a broader solution to their customers 
sales to oems account for a significant portion of our revenues 
sales by industry 
product revenues by industry for the two most recent fiscal years are shown in the table below year ended june  year ended june  consumer and computer electronics machine and industrial automation automotive electronics food  consumer goods and medical oem and other product revenue is comprised of sales of new systems  components  software and parts  and excludes revenue from training  consulting  and field service activities such as maintenance  repair  and system modifications 
oem and other industry revenue includes sales to oems as well as sales related to industrial robot applications 
mix of products sold varies considerably from period to period due to a variety of market and economic factors 
in response to the market need for a axis robot that combines speed  flexibility and precision  in april  we expanded our product portfolio to include the adept viper robot family  a line of axis articulated robots designed specifically for precision assembly applications 
the adept viper family consists of the s  s and s  which combine an advanced axis arm design with adept s high performance smartcontroller platform allowing axis robotics to be used in small part assembly and material handling manufacturing 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we released new products to address the increasing demand for small parts assembly and material handling applications across multiple industries  including automotive  consumer electronics  consumer goods  disk drive  food  industrial tooling  medical devices and pharmaceuticals 
new products included the adept cobra tm s and clean room esd s with motionbox tm servo controller and enhanced versions of adept desktop and adept isight 
these new robots have been designed to ensure reduced application development time  improved speed and accuracy  and the fastest possible configuration and delivery times  resulting in significantly greater return on investment throughout the production lifecycle 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began shipments of a family of new high performance linear modules called adept python linear modules  primarily for the electronics and automotive markets 
these single axis devices can be coupled together by the user to form application specific custom robot mechanisms ranging from two to four axes 
each adept python module is powered by an adept motionblox  an integrated single axis motion controller and power amplifier 
adept python linear modules feature fast delivery times  lower delivered costs  and reduced installation time 
this new level of modularity and system level performance reduces the amount of software programming and cabling required in a workcell or a robotic system that performs a specific automation function 

table of contents over the last two years  we have focused on a strategy to build our service and support business to leverage growth opportunities in the robotics market 
we have designed our core motion controller to work with multiple brands of robots currently being sold by adept and other third party providers  as well as with multiple brands of robot mechanisms already installed in various automation environments 
as a consequence  we are in a position to sell our motion controller into most of the installed base of compatible robot mechanisms when a controller update or upgrade is required 
we use a combination of competitive selling and cooperative agreements to gain access to the customer bases of third party providers 
we believe our services strategy has been very successful  as since its inception we have increased our international orders  increased our service revenue and increased our product margins with the sale of additional controllers 
international sales generally comprise between and of our total revenues for any given quarter  and represented approximately of our total revenues for fiscal in recognition of the increasingly international nature of our business  late in fiscal  we announced a new global vertical market business initiative designed to leverage the dynamics of specific vertical markets within particular geographic regions 
our vertical market initiative focuses resources initially on developing applications for western european and us customers in the automotive electronics  food and consumer goods packaging  medical device  lab diagnostics and other medical markets  and for asian customers in the consumer electronics and disk drive markets 
we are working directly with leading customers in these vertical markets  providing direct sales  service and engineering to develop more targeted products and applications 
by being involved directly with the end users during their product planning phase  rather than learning about the end users project after planning has been completed  we believe we have been more successful having our products included in the final design specifications for customers production and assembly lines 
over the last two years  adept has taken a series of steps to strengthen our operational performance and to enhance our ability to serve our customers in europe and in asia 
we moved a portion of our manufacturing operations to dortmund  germany to better address the european market  we implemented a more flexible supply chain and expanded our field capabilities for both sales and services 
the primary focus of the supply chain and field initiatives was to provide more local focus regionally  so that we are able to ship product more quickly  respond in the local language of our customer and provide better support through the sales and service cycles to our customers 
we believe the improvements in our operating performance and in our services revenues over the last two years are a result of these actions 
we completed a one for five reverse stock split on february  all current and historical share and per share information in this annual report on form k reflects the results of the reverse stock split 
further  in june  adept completed an equity financing with net proceeds of approximately million 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the three year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal   and unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of adept s financial condition and results of operations are based upon adept s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed 
table of contents price contracts  product returns  warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring expenses  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  warranties  deferred tax valuation allowance  foreign currency exchange gain loss  goodwill  and valuation of stock based awards revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
a growing portion of our revenues arises from sales of control products 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  sab  when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangements exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on its historical warranty experience and managements best estimate of adept s warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in these cases  if all of the other conditions referred to above are met  we recognize the revenue as the invoice becomes due 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
adept sells two separate and distinct categories of software software elements within adept s robot and controller products  and standalone software consisting primarily of hexsight  a library of machine vision software tools 
the software elements within adept s products are not sold separately nor are they marketed as separate product offerings to our customers 
our robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of the software enabling tools and other software elements 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold 
table of contents separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
adept believes that the software component of its products is incidental to its products and services taken as a whole 
as a result  we recognize software revenue related to product sales in accordance with sab we recognize stand alone software revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  and software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is probable and v the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
license revenue is recognized on shipment of the product provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management 
insignificant vendor and post contract support obligations are accrued upon shipment of the licensed product 
for software that is installed and integrated by the customer  revenue is recognized upon shipment assuming functionality has already been proven in prior sales and there are no customizations that would cause a substantial acceptance risk 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on revenue recognition policy for adept s component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned remanufactured robots and components 
adept receives parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or adept purchases surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with gaap as reflected in the sab pronouncement requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned remanufactured or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities material and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within the services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
we do not generally request collateral from our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on the greater of of consolidated accounts receivable or of consolidated accounts receivable more than days past due 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost under the first in  first out method  or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
all work in process inventories with work orders that are open in excess of days are fully written down 
the remaining inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at adept s discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with adept s approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we have a net deferred tax asset and determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period that such determination was made 
foreign currency exchange gain loss 
the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  foreign currency translation  with respect to its international operations  which are primarily sales and service entities 
the accounts denominated in non us currencies have been remeasured using the us dollar as the functional currency 
all monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the current exchange rate at the end of the period  nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the period 
the company performs a detailed review of the underlying monetary and nonmonetary transactions each quarter to ensure these transactions are correctly evaluated based on fas pronouncement guidelines 
adept does not currently apply a hedging strategy against its currency positions as defined under fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect to future 
table of contents sales and production volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign exchange rates and selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company tests its intangible assets annually on april unless there are indications during an interim period that such assets may have become impaired 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether intangible assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an intangible asset has become impaired 
valuation of stock based awards 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
acquisitions from time to time  adept may make acquisitions of products  technologies or other businesses 
adept has not consummated any such acquisition in the past three fiscal years 
in fiscal  we acquired a ownership interest in meta control technologies  inc meta  a provider of automation solutions  with the remaining ownership interest in meta being held in escrow for the benefit of one stockholder 
the acquisition agreement provides that adept will acquire all of these remaining shares in return for the provision of discounts and royalty payments to the stockholder and its affiliates of up to million through august but will  in any event and regardless of whether discounts are incurred or royalties paid  acquire of the stock of meta no later than august for no additional consideration 
such amounts will be charged to operations when incurred 
through june   we have not incurred any expenses related to the discounts and royalties and do not anticipate incurring any such expense in fiscal results of operations comparison of fiscal to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in revenue was attributable to a increase in revenues from our services and support segment and a increase in revenues from our robotics segment 
segment results for fiscal have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
robotics segment revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from increased sales of our line of cobra robots and  to a lesser extent  sales of our new adeptviper axis robot and adeptpython linear modules  partially offset by reduced revenues from vision software 
services and support segment revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is attributable to services involved in the redeployment and refurbishing of existing customer equipment and sales to customers of remanufactured robotics  with continued strong demand from the disk drive industry and redeployment of production lines by our customers to plants in china and malaysia 

table of contents our domestic sales were million in fiscal  an increase of compared to million in fiscal this increase was due both to the increase in robot mechanism refurbishment we have experienced in our service business  which is primarily in the us  as well as increased demand from us based multinational integrators and oems for products to serve their offshore clients 
a significant proportion of our us revenue therefore reflects product sales for end user customers actually located in asia and europe although our point of sale is within the us our international sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
european sales were million in fiscal  down from sales of million in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in consumer electronics manufacturing in europe  especially of mobile telephones 
asia sales increased in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal overall  we expect that revenues from our international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales  and that asia will continue to be the fastest growing sales region 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margin improvement resulted principally from a sales mix favoring higher margin products  notably the increased sales of our cobra products  second generation linear module controls  as well as increased sales of remanufactured robots 
other factors contributing to increased margins include increased volume throughput  improved robot component designs that achieve the same functionality at reduced cost  and increased outsourcing of robot subassemblies 
we could  however  experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  and or changes in sales mix of products 
consumption of parts previously reserved as excess or obsolete totaled approximately  due to focus on service sales and the improved management of the fulfillment of those sales  offset by the reservation of approximately  for additional parts determined to be excess or obsolete over the year 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in the growth in r d outlays was the result of recognition of stock based compensation expense totaling approximately  in fiscal as well as increased expenditures for software development activities  offset by  capitalization of software development cost 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products which are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  whichever term is the estimated life of the software product 
adept s capitalization of software costs  which commenced in the second quarter of fiscal  totaled  for fiscal as compared with none the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or in to million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in the increases are primarily due to new product launches  increased marketing activities and an expanded sales force  expenses related to our reincorporation in delaware  stock based employee compensation charges  and the re listing of adept s common stock on nasdaq 
also increased were expenditures for independent audit and controls review activities as we prepare to meet increased requirements in the future resulting from the sarbanes oxley act 
we have not yet undertaken most of effort related to sarbanes oxley section compliance regarding internal controls  and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with that project prior to our completion deadline of june  operating income 
operating income was  for the fiscal year ended june   compared with operating income of  for the fiscal year ended june   reflecting the impact of million of stock compensation expense in fiscal effective july   adept adopted the provisions of fas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based employee compensation as an expense in the calculation of net income  and this had a significant impact on operating income 

table of contents stock compensation expense 
adept adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective july  sfas r requires the recognition of fair value of stock compensation as an expense in the calculation of net income 
we recognize the stock compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the individual equity instruments 
the fair value of stock based employee compensation received only financial statement footnote disclosure in fiscal see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas r 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all stock based awards granted or other awards granted that are subsequently reclassified into equity 
the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested as of july   the date of sfas r adoption by adept  is now being recognized as expense in the calculation of net income using the same valuation method the black scholes model and assumptions disclosed prior to our adoption of sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r we recorded  of stock based compensation expense on our statement of operations for the year ended june  for our stock option plans and espp 
in addition we recorded  of stock based compensation expense on our statement of operations for for restricted stock grants 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the stock compensation expense because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
as of june   in addition to the expense for restricted stock grants discussed above  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options and rights to purchase shares under the espp granted and outstanding 
these costs are expected to be recognized ratably through fiscal year  with a weighted average remaining period of years 
restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal we reversed  in restructuring charges in fiscal and  in fiscal  which resulted primarily from the sublease of unused sales offices 
intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets amortization was  in which was unchanged from the prior year 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in compared to  in interest expense  net declined primarily because of the conversion of a million convertible note into adept common stock  which accrued interest at  at the end of february other income 
other income of  was recorded in fiscal as we disposed of equity positions in third parties  the substantial majority of which had been previously written off 
foreign currency exchange gain 
foreign currency exchange gain was  for compared to a gain of  for the foreign currency exchange gains recorded resulted primarily from our sales and operating activities in europe and movements in the euro versus the us dollar 
the euro strengthened against the us dollar during fiscal  which generated a gain on our net euro positions in europe 
the dollar also weakened compared with the euro during fiscal  resulting in the gains we recorded in that period 
in the past we included foreign currency exchange gains or losses in selling  general and administrative expenses  but beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we have classified foreign currency gains or losses as a separate line item in the income statement  and prior period financial results have been reclassified for consistent presentation 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  as compared with no provision in  as we utilized our operating loss carry forward credits to offset both domestic and foreign taxes in that year 
the current year provision was based upon our operating levels and recent filings of our federal  state  and certain international tax returns 
we also maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax 
table of contents exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns as well as filings in foreign jurisdictions 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretations of statutes and regulations 
we have net operating losses which are sufficient to offset most of our domestic and foreign tax obligations  and an analysis of our existing reserves for taxes led us to make the provision for fiscal backlog 
our product backlog related to continuing operations at june  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at june  this decrease in our backlog reflects our strategic shift in fiscal to selling standard versions of our products  rather than custom designs  as well as focusing on the market for remanufactured products 
this shift in our sales strategy has resulted in a change in our manufacturing model as well  and accordingly we have completed the outsourcing of our product manufacturing and have a adopted a fast order and delivery process that has greatly reduced the time between the receipt and the fulfillment of orders for our customers 
this has resulted in a reduction in backlog  as we now sell our products through fulfilled orders versus the longer term cycles of our previous manufacturing delivery 
customers who have placed orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal period are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all of the backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual net revenues for any period in the future 
comparison of fiscal to discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  adept adopted a formal plan to dispose of and completed the disposition of its solutions business segment for no cash consideration 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal of million included a non cash loss on asset disposal of million  which consisted primarily of million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles and million in write offs of inventory and fixed assets  partially offset by million in other liabilities eliminated upon the disposal of the solutions business segment 
adept will have no significant continued involvement in the solutions business  the cash flows related to the solutions business are eliminated from the ongoing operations  and the sale was fully completed in the third quarter of fiscal  with adept retaining no interest in the solutions business 
accordingly  the solutions business segment was accounted for as a discontinued operation and the results of operations of the solutions business segment have been removed from adept s continuing operations for all periods presented and presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
revenues 
revenues from continuing operations increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase in revenue was attributable to increases in both our robotics and services and support segments 
segment results for fiscal and have been reclassified to be comparable with the fiscal presentation 
robotics segment revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from increased sales of cobra robots and our newly released adeptviper axis robot  partially offset by reduced sales of components for semiconductor manufacturing systems 
additionally  we saw continued growth in software revenues from our hexavision software product  and recorded a significant software license sale of million in the first quarter of fiscal services and support segment revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily attributable to services involved in the redeployment and refurbishing of existing customer equipment  with strong demand from the disk drive industry and increasing redeployment of production lines by our customers to plants in asia 
our domestic sales from continuing operations were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
our international sales from continuing operations were million in fiscal 
table of contents compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in revenues from international sales is primarily attributable to strong sales associated with the automotive component and consumer electronics applications in europe  aided by the favorable exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar for much of the year 
in addition  sales in asia increased by million or to million in fiscal as compared with fiscal gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margin improvement resulted principally from improved robot component designs  increased outsourcing of robot subassemblies  and reduced manufacturing overhead costs 
we also enjoyed the positive impact of the exercise of a vision software license option in the first quarter  which had minimal associated cost of revenues 
over the past several quarters  we have aggressively sought to outsource those processes where we provide little or no additional manufacturing value 
the improvements in production volumes combined with the lower fixed overhead expense resulted in lower unit standard costs and higher corresponding gross margins 
gross margins also benefited in fiscal from sales of products aggregating  for which there was no associated cost of revenues because the inventory had been previously considered excess or obsolete and written off 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses decreased by to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues  in this decrease is primarily the result of decreased spending on fewer  more focused  development projects  modest reductions in headcount  and expanding operations in lower cost facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or to million  or of revenues  in as compared with million  or of revenues  in the increase reflected increases in sales and marketing expenditures to secure new business in the consumer electronic and telecommunications industries and in software sales to oems  as well as increased activity in customer service to expand our reach in europe and china 
also increased were expenditures for independent audit and controls review activities as we must meet increased requirements in the future resulting from the sarbanes oxley act and other accounting and legal requirements  partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges in fiscal reflect a reversal of  in previously accrued restructuring charges 
this resulted from favorable settlement of an outstanding lease obligation 
we reversed an additional  in restructuring charges in fiscal  which resulted primarily from the sublease of unused sales offices 
intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets amortization was  in compared to  in the amortization has declined because certain of our intangible assets have now been fully amortized 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in compared to  in interest expense for both years included interest expense accrued on our million convertible note due june   which bore a fixed interest rate 
in addition  interest expense for includes charges incurred on advances received under an accounts receivable purchase facility and a promissory note  both of which have since been repaid 
other income 
other income of  was recorded in fiscal as we disposed of equity positions in third parties  the substantial majority of which had been previously written off 
foreign currency exchange gain 
foreign currency exchange gain in was  compared to  in these gains resulted primarily from our sales activity in europe and the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar during much of fiscal and in the past we have included foreign currency exchange gains or losses in selling  general and administrative expenses  but beginning in fiscal we classified foreign currency gains or losses as a separate non operating line item in the statement of operations  and prior period financial results have been reclassified for consistent presentation 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was zero as we utilized our operating loss carryforward credits to offset both domestic and foreign taxes 
there was a benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal  which reflects the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from management s reassessment of the appropriate level of tax liabilities for adept based upon our operating levels and recent filings of our federal  state  and certain international tax returns 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets of million net of depreciation  goodwill of million  and  of other intangible assets net of amortization

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and line of credit facility 
we maintain an investment policy  which seeks to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal cash flow amounts and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio in thousands june  fair value cash and cash equivalents average rate auction rate securities average rate fixed income securities average rate we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and contains a prudent amount of diversification 
we conduct business on a global basis 
consequently  we are exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the past  we have previously used a foreign currency hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on local international operational assets and liabilities 
we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency commitments and balance sheet positions 
in march  we determined that our international activities held or conducted in foreign currency did not warrant the cost associated with a hedging program due to decreased exposure of foreign currency exchange risk on international operational assets and liabilities 
as a result  we suspended our foreign currency hedging program in march and we have not resumed the foreign currency hedging program 
we also have a line of credit with silicon valley bank 
we did not borrow under this facility in fiscal and have no current intention to do so in fiscal  however  if we were to drawdown under this facility or issue letters of credit thereunder  adept would be subject to interest rate risk as described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources
