table of contents overview we have experienced a marked improvement in market demand for our products and services 
in fiscal  our markets improved considerably over the difficult market conditions that existed in fiscal and additionally  market price levels are beginning to improve as the overall volume of business activity has increased 
we believe this improvement in the market should benefit our operating results in fiscal this past year  we significantly enhanced our international presence and improved our capability to serve our existing base of global customers 
on july   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain operating liabilities and contracts of switchgear instrumentation  limited 
total consideration paid for s i was approximately million excluding expenses of approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was funded from existing cash and investments  and the balance was provided through additional debt financing 
s i s primary manufacturing facility is located in the united kingdom 
s i is a supplier of medium and low voltage switchgear  intelligent motor control systems and power distribution solutions to a wide range of process industries with a focus on oil and gas  petrochemical  and other process related industries 
the operating results of s i are included in our electrical power products segment from the acquisition date 
additional information concerning this acquisition  related debt and business segments is included in notes c  h and l  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate opportunities outside of the united states to continue to grow  and with the integration with our us operations  s i is expected to significantly improve our ability to support the worldwide investment in oil and gas production  refineries and petrochemical facilities 
beginning in late fiscal  our principal markets of heavy industry and utilities entered into a new investment cycle 
customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  steadily strengthened during the second half of fiscal which led to a strengthening in new orders in fiscal one of the positive trends we have experienced is an increase in new order activity 
orders received during the second half of fiscal totaled million versus million in the same period a year ago 
we currently anticipate that this higher level of business activity will continue into fiscal during  we completed a consolidation plan to reduce the number of facilities in our electrical power products segment 
this consolidation has reduced our overhead costs and improved our operating efficiencies 
in the first three months of  we incurred start up difficulties and inefficiencies as a result of relocating some of our product lines 
these transition inefficiencies have now been resolved  and fiscal should benefit from these consolidations 
during the second half of  we completed our evaluation and selection of a new enterprise resource planning system erp system 
implementation at each of our us electrical power products operations is planned by the end of fiscal the implementation of a new erp system will provide the tools needed to redesign  streamline and standardize our business processes across the business segment with the goal of improving efficiencies and reducing costs of operations 
results of operations year ended october   compared to year ended october  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues of million 
revenues increased primarily due to general market recovery  a concerted sales effort aimed at strengthening our backlog and our acquisition of s i in july the s i acquisition added revenues of million  all outside the united states  in fiscal for the twelve months ended october   revenues in the united states increased by to million 
revenues outside of the united states were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to our acquisition of s i 
revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to our acquisition of s i 

table of contents electrical power products our electrical power products segment recorded revenues of million in fiscal  which includes revenues of million from our july acquisition of s i  compared to million for the previous year 
during fiscal  revenues from utility markets and from industrial customers strengthened compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  revenues from public and private utilities were approximately million  an increase of million compared to fiscal revenues from industrial customers totaled million in fiscal  a increase over the prior year 
municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million in fiscal compared to million a year ago 
the electrical power products segment reported gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  of in fiscal  compared to in fiscal material costs for basic commodities increased million in fiscal compared to a year ago  primarily due to higher unit prices for copper  aluminum and steel 
in addition  gross profit margins were adversely impacted in fiscal due to competitive pricing pressures as a result of depressed market levels when projects were bid in previous periods 
gross profit in fiscal was adversely impacted by one time expenses of million associated with our decision to close certain underutilized operating facilities 
these expenses included employee severance  training and equipment relocation costs 
process control systems revenues in our process control systems segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the strength of our revenues is related  in part  to our contract to design and build the intelligent transportation systems its for the holland and lincoln tunnels 
revenues in fiscal also include million related to the favorable settlement of a claim which was not recorded by the company related to the central artery tunnel project as discussed in note k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase in gross profit margin can be attributed to improved execution on a number of projects nearing completion and the recovery of previously recognized costs on the central artery tunnel project 
additionally  gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately million in and million in related primarily to legal costs incurred related to the recovery of amounts owed on a previously completed contract 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal approximately of this increase is related to the business activities of s i  acquired in july commission expenses for sales representatives as well as direct sales expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the concerted effort to increase revenues and backlog discussed above 
accounting and professional fees have increased by million primarily due to costs incurred for sarbanes oxley compliance and costs associated with on going acquisition activities 
these increases in selling  general and administrative costs were partially offset by one time costs incurred in fiscal of approximately million and reduced costs in resulting from the closing of certain manufacturing facilities 
additionally  research and development expenditures decreased to million in fiscal from million last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses have also increased due to the commensurate increase in revenue 

table of contents interest income and expense interest expense increased by million to million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to interest on debt incurred in july related to our acquisition of s i and interest payments to state taxing authorities 
we earned approximately million of interest income in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal interest income increased primarily due to higher market interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to a benefit of in fiscal during and  we recorded several tax adjustments related to the following items a a million benefit was recorded for the years ended and primarily for the benefit of revised extraterritorial income exclusion amounts 
this benefit was derived by calculating the extraterritorial income exclusion amount on a transaction by transaction basis in and  as opposed to an aggregate basis as originally estimated  b a million valuation allowance related to capital losses was released in we entered into an agreement in to sell a capital asset that will trigger enough capital gain to utilize the capital loss carryforward c we reduced our income tax provision by million in due to acceptance by certain state taxing authorities of voluntary disclosure agreements in  and d we increased our income tax provision by million in related to certain adjustments from audits of our prior year federal tax returns 
net income in fiscal  we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal higher gross profits from our process control systems business segment and s i  our sale of land and building  partially offset by higher selling  general  and administrative expenses and interest expense have contributed to the overall increase in net income in fiscal compared to the prior year 
backlog the order backlog on october   was million  compared to million at fiscal year end  an increase of 
orders included in backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts  which we believe to be firm 
new orders placed during the year totaled million compared to million in fiscal a portion of the increase in backlog relates to a contract totaling approximately million over a four year period 
this contract is with a municipal agency and production began in the first quarter of fiscal year ended october   compared with year ended october  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal year revenues of million 
domestic revenues decreased million to million in compared to revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to in 
table of contents electrical power products our electrical power products segment recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal customers had been reluctant to commit to new capital construction projects throughout fiscal due to economic uncertainty 
however  we were able to expand revenues related to system modification and equipment replacement as customers looked for ways to extend the lives of existing systems 
overall  we experienced a decline in revenues in each of our major markets 
revenues from industrial customers were million in compared to million in utility revenues were million in compared to million in municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million compared to million in gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal costs of goods sold included one time expenses of million to consolidate our operations 
consolidation expenses included employee severance  training and equipment relocation costs 
inflationary pressures  primarily due to higher commodity prices in copper  aluminum and steel increased direct material expenses by approximately  or million  compared to fiscal both revenue and gross profit have been adversely impacted by competitive pricing in a depressed marketplace 
partially offsetting adverse market conditions have been the results of our efforts to reduce our production overhead costs by improving operating efficiencies through the implementation of lean initiatives 
process control systems revenues in our process control systems segment increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributed to our contract to design and build intelligent transportation systems its for the holland and lincoln tunnels for the port authority of new york and new jersey 
this contract accounted for million of segment revenues in fiscal and million in fiscal at october   the remaining value associated with this project in backlog was million  or of segment backlog  which was expected to be recognized as revenue in export revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year gross profits as a percentage of revenues were reduced in due to the large amount of subcontract work and material pass through purchases on the holland and lincoln tunnels contract which typically generates significantly lower profits compared to our other professional services 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal in fiscal  accounting and auditing fees increased million compared to  primarily attributable to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
one time consolidation expenses of million were incurred in fiscal these expenses were costs associated with actions to consolidate our operations and close certain facilities which represented excess capacity 
the benefit of lower operating overheads should be realized beginning in excluding the impact of these increases  selling  general and administrative expenses would have decreased consistent with revenues 
research and development expenditures were million in compared to million in fiscal our research efforts were directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes  as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
research and development costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents interest income and expense we incurred million in interest expense in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense was reduced by favorable interest rates and a decreased balance on our industrial revenue bond debt 
our industrial revenue bonds have scheduled payments of million that become due each year in october 
additionally  in fiscal  we incurred million in interest expense on our term loan and the associated interest rate swap 
in september  we paid the remaining principal balance on our term loan  which reduced our interest expense 
we earned million in interest income in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
interest income increased primarily due to higher levels of invested funds 
provision for income taxes our income tax provision benefit for fiscal and was million and million  and our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
during  we recorded several tax adjustments related to the following items a a million benefit was recorded primarily for the benefit of revised extraterritorial income exclusion amounts for the years ended and this benefit was derived by calculating the extraterritorial income exclusion amount on a transaction by transaction basis in  as opposed to an aggregate basis as originally estimated  b a million valuation allowance related to capital losses was released in we entered into an agreement in to sell a capital asset that will trigger enough capital gain to utilize the capital loss carryforward  and c we reduced our income tax provision by million in due to acceptance by certain state taxing authorities of voluntary disclosure agreements 
without these adjustments  our effective tax rate would have been net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year the decrease in net income primarily related to lower business volume and decreased gross profits in fiscal gross profits declined as a result of one time consolidation costs  inflationary pressures on materials costs  and depressed market price levels 
partially offsetting lower gross profits were higher interest income and a net income tax benefit 
in fiscal  net income was negatively impacted as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge accounted for a loss of per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources we have maintained a positive liquidity position 
working capital was million at october   compared to million at october  as of october   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
at october   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at october  long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  totaled million at october   compared to million at october  in addition to our long term debt  we have a million revolving credit agreement in support of our us debt requirements and an additional million approximately million revolving credit agreement in the united kingdom  both of which expire june as of october   there was approximately 
table of contents million borrowed under these lines of credit 
for further information regarding our debt  see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million and million during and  respectively 
this reduction in cash was principally used to fund the growth in accounts receivable  inventories and costs related to uncompleted contracts which have not been billed 
this use of cash has resulted from the need for increased levels of working capital needed to support increased levels of business activity 
during fiscal and  operating activities provided net cash of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  resulted from a reduction in operating assets and liabilities with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for depreciation  amortization  and other noncash expenses 
lower levels of business activity in and resulted in lower levels of working capital required to support operating needs 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of our capital investments were used to improve our capabilities to manufacture switchgear and electrical power control rooms as well as initial investments in a new erp system 
we have committed to capital projects totaling million to acquire and implement an erp system at our domestic electrical power products operations 
as of the end of fiscal  we have incurred costs of million on this project 
we expect to incur the balance during in  investing activities included costs of million for the acquisition of s i 
during and  the majority of our capital expenditures were used to increase our manufacturing capabilities to produce switchgear  electrical power control and power control modules 
proceeds from the sale of fixed assets provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  primarily from the sale of idled manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal  we sold property located in greenville  texas  which was idled in  and in fiscal  we sold property located in franklin park  illinois  which was idled in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities were million in fiscal compared to cash used to purchase marketable securities of million in marketable securities were sold to finance working capital requirements of the business in fiscal during  net cash of million was used to purchase various types of marketable securities as a result of positive operating cash flow in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided of million and net cash used of million in and  respectively 
the primary source of cash from financing activities was proceeds from borrowings of million under the term loan associated with our acquisition and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the primary source of cash from financing in fiscal was from the exercise of stock options 
in september  we paid the remaining principal balance on an existing term loan 
the repayment of this loan was the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal 
table of contents contractual obligations at october   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
long term capital operating debt lease lease obligations obligations obligations total as of october   payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations other commercial commitments the following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event in thousands 
letters of credit as of october  payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of october   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
we also had performance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at october  performance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook for fiscal we expect the recent improvement in our principal markets to continue into customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  steadily strengthened during the second half of fiscal which led to a strengthening in new orders in fiscal one of the positive trends we have experienced is an increase in new order activity 
orders received during the second half of fiscal totaled million versus million in the same period a year ago 
we currently anticipate that this higher level of business activity will continue into fiscal in our electrical power products segment  third and fourth quarter orders increased both sequentially and year over year 
in addition  we will benefit from a full year of revenue and earnings contribution from our acquisition of s i 
although our process controls systems segment continues to experience soft market conditions  we anticipate that increased funding for municipal projects will be available as general economic conditions strengthen 
we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions 
we anticipate that we will continue to reinvest a portion of our cash generated from operations into working capital in fiscal working capital needs are anticipated to increase with growing levels of business activity 
we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations 
table of contents will be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and possible future acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
any strategic acquisition of a new business es or product line s could require additional borrowings 
effects of inflation the pace of new orders significantly strengthened as progressed and we ended the year with an order rate that we have not experienced since we anticipate that these conditions will continue into this is a marked improvement over and in which we experienced a significant deterioration in business volume due to the effects of the us economy on our markets and customers 
during those years  new investments in infrastructure projects were curtailed in both our utility and industrial market segments  and our municipal customers faced a reduced tax base with which to fund infrastructure projects 
beginning in  there were indications of an improving us economy  and new business inquiry levels strengthened throughout we have experienced significant price pressures with our key raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel since the us economy began to show signs of improvement in competitive market pressures limited our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers 
these competing pressures eroded our earnings in and we anticipate that these inflationary pressures will continue to adversely impact our operations in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as provided by the american institute for certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total labor dollars or hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor dollars or hours estimated at completion 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 

table of contents revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows or in general economic conditions could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we have significant investments in long lived assets  including property and equipment and goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we also evaluate potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis 
the review for impairment of long lived assets and goodwill takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon budgets and longer range plans 
these budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties about future business trends 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
as a result  impairment charges that possibly should have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual cash flows deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
based on general economic conditions and conditions specific to our industry  the ultimate amounts realized on assets held for sale may differ materially from their currently estimated realizable values 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies  such as insurance and legal claims  arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any other valuation allowances as of october  because we believe that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 

table of contents foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  requires that each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability and measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income loss from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
on july   we entered into a forward foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million canadian dollars maturing on december  this foreign currency derivative qualifies for and is classified as a fair value hedge 
the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
changes in fair values of outstanding fair value hedge derivatives that are effective are recorded in other comprehensive income  until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction 
in most cases  amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income sometime after the maturity of the related derivative 
gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains losses  as applicable 
at october   the fair value of the forward swap contract resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately  this contract matured on december   resulting in a realized foreign exchange loss of  new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt this standard at the beginning of fiscal and will elect the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the income statement 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  the market value of our common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our stock price  volatility  and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  we believe the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the section in note d to the notes to consolidated financial statements titled stock based compensation disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt and investments in marketable debt securities 
regarding our various debt instruments outstanding at october   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of approximately  our investments in marketable debt securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the marketable securities as reported 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
overall  we believe that changes in interest rates will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the fiscal year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
on july   we entered into a forward foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million canadian dollars to mature on december  this foreign currency derivative qualifies for and is classified as a foreign currency fair value hedge 
the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
changes in fair values of outstanding fair value hedge derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income  until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction 
in most cases  amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income sometime after the maturity of the related derivative 
gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains losses  as applicable 
at october   the fair value of the forward swap contract resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately  this contract matured on december  resulting in a realized foreign exchange loss of approximately  commodity price risk we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract by contract basis to avoid profit margin erosion 
while we may do so in the future  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity risk in fiscal we continue to experience price increases with some of our key raw materials 
competitive market pressures limited our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers  thus eroding our earnings in fiscal fluctuations in commodity prices may have a material near term effect on our future earnings and cash flows
