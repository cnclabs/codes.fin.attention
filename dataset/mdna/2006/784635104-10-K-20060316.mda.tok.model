item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
all dollar and share amounts are in millions 
executive overview overall  was a successful year for spx 
we entered the year with three key priorities continue to simplify the company  increase our financial flexibility  and return value to shareholders 
we made significant progress against each of these priorities  as summarized below 
continue to simplify the company over the last to months  our efforts have focused on streamlining our business to allow us to concentrate our resources on those platforms with the greatest growth potential 
in connection with this  we completed the following activities during re aligned our businesses into three growth segments flow technology  test and measurement  and thermal equipment and services  which are our core platforms for future growth 
these segments are defined as having substantial opportunities for growth within the current markets they serve  as well as the potential for expansion into additional markets 
the remaining businesses  which generally represent north american focused industrial operations that lack global scale  are reported in a fourth segment identified as industrial products and services 
sold a total of seven businesses which did not fit into our long term strategy for  in cash 
additionally  we completed the sale of vance international  inc in january  resulting in cash proceeds of completed the acquisition of cartool for a purchase price of  net of cash acquired of  which represents a strategic fit for our test and measurement segment 
increase our financial flexibility during  spx committed to a plan to reduce our outstanding debt and improve our leverage ratios and overall financial flexibility to support the growth of our three core platforms 
the following are the key accomplishments against this objective in repaid long term debt of  entered into new global senior credit facilities in an aggregate amount of  the new senior credit facilities replaced our previous domestic credit facility and provided the funds to repay the outstanding lyons for which substantially all the holders exercised an early repayment option in february return value to shareholders during  under our quarterly dividend program  we distributed of dividends to shareholders 
additionally  we implemented a number of changes and initiatives designed to further align our direction and objectives with those of our shareholders the spx board of directors approved two separate share repurchase programs during  the most recent of which was approved on december  under these programs  we have repurchased shares with a value of through february  of this amount  had been settled as of december  improved operating cash flows and segment income and margins compared to implemented a new incentive compensation plan for our executive and management team replacing the economic value added plan  with incentive payments based generally on financial metrics such as operating profit margin and operating cash flows 
included an spx shareholder return measure versus the s p index as a vesting criterion for the majority of our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  repatriated of foreign undistributed earnings at favorable tax rates 
initiatives for and beyond in addition to the accomplishments described above  we implemented six key operating initiatives to improve operating income and margins 
these long term initiatives focus on continuous improvement  and we expect to realize significant benefits in the next to months 
the key initiatives are lean manufacturing  supply chain management  new product development  information technology centralization  organizational development and emerging markets most notably china 
the following are some of our key accomplishments to date and opportunities identified that we expect to deliver the anticipated operating income and margin improvements in and beyond made organizational investments to lead the deployment of lean manufacturing throughout the organization and are in the process of identifying cost savings and process improvement opportunities in each business 
established multi year performance targets for reducing annual material spend as part of the supply chain management initiative 
established a target of a reduction in the number of enterprise resource planning software erp systems across the company 
sales into china were approximately in  a increase over  and now represent approximately of our consolidated revenues 
additionally  more than of our work force is now employed in china and several of our businesses have targeted this market for continued strategic growth 
other significant items there were a number of other significant items that impacted our operating results  including impairment charges of relating to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our air filtration and dock products reporting units 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
losses on the early extinguishment of debt of these losses were the result of i premiums and fees paid and the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of our senior notes and the termination of our previous credit facility  and ii the termination of the remaining interest rate protection agreements in connection with the early repayments of the term loans under the previous credit facilities 
additional income tax expense of approximately associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 
effective pricing management  which generally offset increases in raw material costs across our segments 
increases in raw material costs represented a significant detriment to gross profit in results of continuing operations seasonality and competition many of our businesses follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
in addition  certain businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
our heating and ventilation products businesses tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters  as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns 
demand for cooling towers and related services is highly correlated to contract timing on large construction contracts  which may cause significant fluctuations from period to period 
revenues for our service solutions business typically follow program launch timing for diagnostic systems and service equipment 
in aggregate  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year 
although our businesses operate in highly competitive markets  our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since our competitors do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets 
in addition  specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors 
in most product groups  competition comes from numerous concerns  both large and small 
the principal methods of competition are price  service  product performance and technical innovations 
these methods vary with the type of product sold 
we believe we can compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors as they apply to the various products we offer 
non gaap measures organic revenue growth decline presented herein represents total revenues  excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes 
we believe that this metric can be a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our normal operating performance for the periods presented because it excludes items that are either not completely under management s control or not an accurate reflection of our underlying growth 
in addition  organic revenue growth decline is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business 
this metric  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue growth decline as determined in accordance with gaap

these amounts are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   with included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and included in income loss from discontinued operations 
the lyons are net of unamortized discount of and at december  and december   respectively 
on may   the may lyons were redeemed in full for the remaining february lyons had a put option date within twelve months of december  february 
in accordance with sfas no 
 classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor  obligations that are by their terms due upon demand within one year of the balance sheet date are to be considered short term obligations  unless the obligor has the ability and intent to refinance 
in february  all but of the february lyons were put to us and settled in cash for  their accreted value on such date  with amounts borrowed under the delayed draw term loan of our new senior credit facilities 
since the february lyons have been subsequently refinanced with amounts under our new senior credit facilities  we have classified the outstanding balance for the february lyons as long term debt as of december  no amounts were outstanding at december  under the new senior credit facilities  entered into on november   as further discussed below 
credit facilities on november   we entered into new senior credit facilities with a group of lenders that replaced our existing credit facilities  which were simultaneously terminated 
the new senior credit facilities provide for committed senior secured financing of approximately  consisting of the following a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of with final maturity in november   a domestic revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of with final maturity in november   a global revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of with final maturity in november   and a foreign trade facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to the us dollar equivalent  at issuance  of with final maturity in november   subject to two possible extensions of the final maturity date of two years each  at our option 
we have the ability to add additional commitments under the foreign trade facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to the us dollar equivalent of  without the need for consent of the existing lenders 
in addition  we may also seek additional commitments from new or current lenders for incremental term loan facilities or increases in commitments in respect to the other facilities not exceeding an aggregate principal amount of  without the need for consent of the existing lenders 
in february  in conjunction with the redemption of the lyons see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details  we became a borrower under the delayed draw term loan facility 
we currently utilize the revolving loan facilities for the issuance of letters of credit and certain of our foreign subsidiaries utilize and others may utilize the foreign trade facility for the issuance of foreign credit instruments 
the revolving credit facility may be used from time to time for working capital and general corporate purposes  including domestic letters of credit of up to  by our subsidiaries and us 
the foreign trade facility may be used by our foreign subsidiaries to obtain bank guarantees  stand by letters of credit and similar foreign trade instruments in connection with their business operations 
the interest rates applicable to loans under our new senior credit facilities will be  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate abr or prime or an adjusted eurodollar bank deposit rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin percentage  which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio generally defined as the ratio of consolidated total debt net of cash equivalents in excess of at the date of determination to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date 
we may elect interest periods of one  two  three or six months for eurodollar borrowings 
the interest rate margins applicable to base rate and euro dollar loans are as follows consolidated leverage ratio margin for eurocurrency loans and foreign credit instruments margin for abr loans greater than or equal to to between to and to between to and to between to and to less than to the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments with each such payment being equal to a percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the initial term loans borrowed by us  as follows i starting in the second quarter of approximately per quarter  ii per quarter  iii per quarter  iv per quarter  and v per quarter 
our new senior credit facilities require mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition including from any casualty to  or a governmental taking of property other than in the ordinary course of business and subject to other exceptions by us or our subsidiary guarantors in excess of mandatory prepayments will be applied first to prepay the term loan and then to reduce permanently the term loan commitments 
no prepayment or commitment reduction is required to the extent the net proceeds are reinvested in permitted acquisitions  permitted investments or assets to be used in our business within days of the receipt of such proceeds 
indebtedness under our new senior credit facilities is guaranteed by i each of our material domestic subsidiaries  ii each of our material first tier foreign subsidiaries  to the extent no material adverse tax consequence would result and to the extent permitted under local law  and iii us with respect to the obligations of our subsidiaries under the foreign trade facility 
in addition  indebtedness under our new senior credit facilities is secured by a first priority pledge and security interest in of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiary guarantors and of the capital stock of our material first tier foreign subsidiaries 
if the outstanding indebtedness under the new senior credit facilities is rated ba or less by moody s and bb or less by s p  then we and our domestic subsidiary guarantors are required to grant security interests  mortgages and other liens on substantially all of our property 
our new senior credit facilities require that we maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally defined as the ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date to consolidated interest expense for such period as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least to  and a consolidated leverage ratio net of cash equivalents in excess of as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of no more than to 
our new senior credit facilities also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  loans  guarantees or advances  make restricted junior payments  including dividends  redemptions of capital stock and voluntary prepayments or repurchase of certain other indebtedness  engage in mergers  acquisitions or sales of assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
we do not expect these covenants to restrict our liquidity  financial condition or access to capital resources in the foreseeable future 
lastly  our new senior credit facilities contain customary representations  warranties  affirmative covenants  and events of default 
we are permitted under our new senior credit facilities to repurchase our capital stock and pay cash dividends in an unlimited amount if our gross consolidated leverage ratio is less than to 
if our gross consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to to  the aggregate amount of such repurchases and dividend declarations cannot exceed a in any fiscal year plus b an additional amount for all such repurchases and dividend declarations made after november  equal to the sum of i and ii a positive amount equal to of cumulative consolidated net income during the period from october  to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial information is available preceding the date of such repurchase or dividend declaration or  in case such consolidated net income is a deficit  minus of such deficit 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenant provisions of our new senior credit facilities  and did not have any restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends 
senior notes during the first quarter of  we completed cash tender offers for  or  of the then outstanding principal amount of our and senior notes 
the amount of the notes tendered exceeded the requisite consent thresholds for removing substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain of the default provisions contained in the indenture governing the senior notes 
additionally  during the second and third quarter of  we redeemed of the senior notes 
other borrowings and financing activities certain of our businesses participate in extended accounts payable programs through agreements with certain lending institutions 
under the arrangements  our businesses are provided extended payment terms 
as of december  and december   the participating businesses had and  respectively  outstanding under these arrangements 
additionally  certain of our businesses purchase goods and services under a purchasing card program allowing for payment beyond normal payment terms 
as of december  and december   the participating businesses had and outstanding under this arrangement 
as these arrangements extend the payment of our businesses payables beyond their normal payment terms through third party lending institutions  we have classified these amounts as short term debt 
in the first nine months of  we entered into sale and assignment transactions whereby certain of our businesses sold without recourse certain accounts receivable 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we discontinued the sale of accounts receivable 
in april  we entered into a three year trade receivables financing agreement  which was extended in november for an additional year  whereby we can borrow  on a continuous basis  up to availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances  but will not exceed the program limit 
the facility contains representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities customary for facilities of this type 
the facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business 
we had outstanding under this financing agreement at both december  and current availability at december   we had  of available borrowing capacity under our new term and revolving credit facilities and of available issuance capacity under our foreign trade facility after giving effect to and  respectively  reserved for outstanding letters of credit 
in february  our availability under our new senior credit facilities was reduced by  as we borrowed against our delay draw term loan in order to refinance the february lyons 
we believe that current cash and equivalents  which totaled at december   and our availability under our new senior credit facilities and existing trade receivable financing agreement will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  on going equity repurchases  dividend payments  other operational cash requirements  and required debt service 
we have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued for acquisitions 
we also have a  shelf registration that may be used in connection with an offering of certain debt and or equity securities for general corporate purposes or for the refinancing of existing debt 
in addition  other financing instruments may be used from time to time  including  but not limited to  private placement instruments  operating leases  capital leases and securitizations 
we expect that we will continue to access these markets as appropriate to maintain liquidity and to provide sources of funds for general corporate purposes or to refinance existing debt 
cash and other commitments balances  if any  under the revolving loans and foreign trade facilities of our new senior credit facilities are payable in full in november  the maturity date of the facilities 
balances under the delayed draw term loan of our new senior credit facilities are payable in quarterly installments with each such payment being equal to the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the initial term loans borrowed by us  as follows i starting in june approximately per quarter  per quarter  iii per quarter  per quarter  and per quarter 
we use operating leases to finance certain equipment and other purchases 
at december   we had of future minimum rental payments under operating leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
on june   we adopted a written trading plan under rule b of the exchange act to facilitate the common stock share repurchase program that was previously authorized by our board of directors on march  on december   our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program  replacing the existing repurchase program 
the new share repurchase program is consistent with  and allows for share repurchases in an amount up to that permitted by  our new senior credit facilities 
on such date  we also adopted a new rule b plan to facilitate the repurchase of up to shares of our common stock in accordance with the new share repurchase program 
under these programs  we have repurchased  through december   shares for we repurchased an additional shares for through february  in  our board of directors approved the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
the actual amount of each quarterly dividend  as well as each declaration date  record date and payment date is subject to the discretion of the board of directors  and the target dividend level may be adjusted during the year at the discretion of the board of directors 
the factors that the board of directors considers in determining the actual amount of each quarterly dividend include our financial performance and on going capital needs  our ability to declare and pay dividends under the terms of our credit facilities and any other debt instruments  and other factors deemed relevant 
during  we declared and paid dividends of and  respectively  while in we declared and paid dividends of and  respectively 
capital expenditures for totaled  compared to and in and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate primarily to upgrades of manufacturing facilities and replacements of equipment 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to  with the increase relating primarily to erp system investments in efforts to consolidate the numerous it platforms within our businesses 
in  we made contributions and direct benefit payments of to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans  and we expect to make of contributions and direct benefit payments in see note to our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of expected future contributions and benefit payments 
on a net basis  both from continuing and discontinued operations  we paid   and in cash taxes for   and in  we made payments of associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal  state  and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of a significant amount of the tax payments related to the gains on the sales of bomag  est  and kendro  as well as the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the amount of income taxes that we may pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in past years 
as of december   except as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we did not have any material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other than the following of certain standby letters of credit outstanding  of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility  and approximately of surety bonds 
in addition  of our standby letters of credit relate to self insurance matters and originate from workers compensation  auto  or general liability claims made against us 
we account for each of these claims as part of our self insurance accruals 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us  subject to limited exceptions 
while we maintain insurance for this type of liability  the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
we continually review each of our businesses in order to determine their long term strategic fit 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
additionally  we have stated that we may consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria were met 
there can be no assurances that these acquisitions will not have a significant impact on our capital financing requirements  will be integrated successfully  or that they may not have a negative effect on our operations 
in addition  you should read item a 
risk factors  segment results of operations included in this md a  and item business for an understanding of the risks  uncertainties and trends facing our businesses 
credit risk cash and temporary investments and our interest rate and foreign currency protection agreements are placed with high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
we periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to a large number of customers in a particular industry 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 
no customer or group of customers that  to our knowledge  are under common control accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for all periods presented 
on october   the delphi corporation delphi filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
delphi is a customer within our industrial products and services and test and measurement segments 
annual revenues derived from delphi represent less than of our consolidated revenues  and we have approximately of pre petition bankruptcy accounts receivable due from delphi and approximately of committed assets 
we have not recorded any loss as a result of delphi s chapter proceedings 
we will continue to evaluate whether  when and to what extent we may be required to record a loss for the accounts receivable and or the committed assets 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to our interest rate and foreign currency protection agreements  but have no other off balance sheet credit risk of accounting loss 
we anticipate  however  that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk  but we do monitor the credit standing of counter parties 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our primary contractual obligations total due within year due in years due in years due after years short term debt obligations long term debt obligations purchase and other contractual obligations future minimum lease payments interest payments total contractual cash obligations  in february  the holders of the february lyons put to us all but of the outstanding february lyons at the accreted price on such date of the payment of the february lyons was funded through our new senior credit facilities  and has been classified as long term debt as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
represents contractual legally binding commitments to purchase goods and services at specified dates  and amounts payable to our former chairman  chief executive officer  and president of approximately that is payable in represents rental payments under operating leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
contingent obligations  such as environmental accruals  generally do not have specific payment dates and accordingly have been excluded from the above table 
our long term liabilities include both pension and postretirement obligations  of which certain of these obligations are non funded and are paid out of our assets 
these obligations and related annual payment amounts are subject to change due to actual participant experience and participant elections 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the amounts  they have been excluded from the above table 
we made contributions and direct benefit payments of in and we expect to make to these plans in we did not make any material cash contributions to our primary domestic pension plans in the required amount of contributions to our domestic pension plans is based upon  among other things  the actual return on plan assets and the growth in the overall obligation 
we currently do not expect any material cash contributions in the near future  however  the united states congress is currently considering pension funding reform  which if passed  could materially change the annual funding requirements of our domestic pension plans 
although there are multiple bills being considered  the passage of any of the bills in their current form could negatively impact our future cash flow funding requirements 
due to the uncertainty of the required funding  no amounts have been included above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of expected future benefit payments 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties are listed below 
this section should be read in conjunction with notes and to our consolidated financial statements  which includes a detailed discussion on these and other accounting policies 
long term contract accounting certain of our businesses  primarily within the test and measurement and thermal equipment and services segments  recognize revenues and profits from long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of future revenues and costs over the full term of product delivery 
in  and  we recognized  and of revenues under the percentage of completion method  respectively 
provisions for losses  if any  on uncompleted long term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
in the case of customer change orders for uncompleted long term contracts  estimated recoveries are included for work performed in forecasting ultimate profitability on certain contracts 
due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that completion costs  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  will be revised in the near term 
such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts arise when revenues have been recorded but the amounts have not been billed under the terms of the contracts 
these amounts are recoverable from customers upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of the contract 
claims related to long term contracts are recognized as revenue only after management has determined that collection is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated 
claims made by us may involve negotiation and  in certain cases  litigation 
in the event we incur litigation costs in connection with claims  such litigation costs are expensed as incurred although we may seek to recover these costs 
claims against us are recognized when a loss is considered probable and amounts are reasonably determinable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are subject to annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
we considered a number of factors  including the input of an independent appraisal firm  in conducting the impairment testing of our reporting units 
we perform our impairment testing by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reported net assets  with such testing occurring during the fourth quarter of each year 
fair value is generally based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted cash flows  based on the most recent financial projections for the reporting units 
the revenue growth rates included in the financial projections are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
the result of our impairment testing was that the carrying value of the net assets of our air filtration and dock products reporting units  components of the flow technology and industrial products and services segments  respectively  exceeded their related fair values 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of in the fourth quarter of the calculation of fair value for our reporting units incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates  profit margin  and discount factors 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
this is particularly true for the reporting units for which we recognized impairment charges in  as the carrying value of the net assets of these reporting units were reduced to their respective fair values 
we will continue to monitor impairment indicators across our reporting units  including  but not limited to  air filtration  dock products  contech  dehydration and waukesha electric systems 
the aggregate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances for these five reporting units was at december  employee benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans that cover a significant portion of our salaried and hourly paid employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
additionally  we have domestic postretirement plans that provide health and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and their dependents 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
the critical assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses are discount rates  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost projections 
these critical assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated at least annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  actual results may differ 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
our domestic plans account for in excess of of our total pension obligations at december  in  the expected long term rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 
a basis point reduction in this expected long term rate of return would increase pension expense by the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate is the yield on high quality fixed income investments at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to reflect market interest rate conditions  we reduced our weighted average discount rate for our domestic pension plans from in to 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the healthcare cost trend rate  which is the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  was 
this rate is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
a one percentage point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase postretirement expense by see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state  federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration by tax jurisdiction 
we believe that it is more likely than not that certain of these net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable 
the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions and ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed adjustments 
we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a continuous basis and accrue for potential contingencies when we believe a liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accruals for these contingencies are recorded based on an expectation as to the timing of when the contingency will be resolved 
as events change or resolution occurs  these accruals are adjusted  such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding certain of our tax contingencies 
product warranty in the normal course of business  we issue product warranties for specific product lines and provide for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
we provide for the estimate of warranty cost based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
in addition  due to the seasonal fluctuations at certain of our businesses  the timing of warranty provisions and the usage of warranty accruals can vary period to period 
we make adjustments to initial obligations for warranties as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities litigation and environmental matters numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  class actions  derivative lawsuits and contract  intellectual property  competitive  personal injury  product liability  workers compensation and other claims  have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are unaware currently or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with our acquisitions that we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
however  we believe that our accruals related to these items  which totaled and at december  and  respectively  are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
it is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims  including legal expenses  when events exist that make the realization of the losses or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments  including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies  differences in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
we expense costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues unless they extend the economic useful life of related assets 
we record liabilities and report expenses when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance  litigation and other recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  and health costs  and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability 
our accruals for self insurance liabilities are determined by management  are based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  and are not discounted 
management considers a number of factors  including third party actuarial valuations  when making these determinations 
we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined amounts 
new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
the following summarizes only those pronouncements that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and superseded accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments  including stock options  based on their grant date fair values 
in april  the sec amended the effective date of sfas no 
r and  accordingly  it is now effective starting with the first annual period beginning after june  we intend to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units upon adoption 
we intend to apply both the black scholes for options and monte carlo simulator for performance based restricted stock and restricted stock units valuation models to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized over the requisite service period 
the monte carlo simulator valuation technique includes assumptions regarding the movement of stock prices and the effects of volatility  interest rates  and dividends 
these assumptions are based on historical data points and are taken from market data sources 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our stock based compensation expense in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all amounts are in millions we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  such instruments may become speculative if the future cash flows originally hedged are no longer probable of occurring as anticipated 
we have interest rate protection agreements with financial institutions to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro  british pound  and chinese yuan 
we generally do not hedge translation exposures 
the following table provides information  as of december   about our primary outstanding debt obligations and presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates  weighted average interest rates  and fair values

we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from operations  availability under revolving credit facilities  and availability under our trade receivable financing agreement will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  on going equity repurchases  dividend payments  other operational cash requirements and required debt service obligations for the foreseeable future 
as of december  we have foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of outstanding as of december   with scheduled maturities of   and in    and  respectively 
the contracts have a fair value of  which is recorded as a current liability as of december
