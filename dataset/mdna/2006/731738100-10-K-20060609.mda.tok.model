overview business polymedica was organized in today  through our largest segment  diabetes  under the liberty brand  we are a leading provider of direct to consumer diabetes testing supplies  primarily to seniors 
we provide a simple and reliable way for our patients to obtain their supplies and medications 
our model is a high touch communications model  which helps seniors more easily cope with the complexity of managing diabetes while helping them navigate through the rigors of healthcare insurance paperwork 
we communicate directly with our patients and their physicians regarding patients prescriptions and testing regimen on a regular basis and we bill medicare  other government agencies  third party insurers and patients 
through our pharmacy segment  we provide prescription medications primarily to existing diabetes patients and their spouses and we bill government agencies  third party insurers and patients 
we additionally provide healthcare communication services and technology that enhance patient care communications by offering medical call and contact center services and technology solutions focused on electronic patient relationship management 
in september  we sold the women s health products division of our pharmacy segment  which manufactured and sold prescription and over the counter urology products to distributors and retailers and in march  we sold our liberty respiratory segment  which provided direct to consumer respiratory medications 
accordingly  the operating results and applicable cash flows  assets and liabilities for these businesses have been reclassified into discontinued operations for current and historical periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
polymedica s significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all of our accounting policies impact the consolidated financial statements  certain policies are viewed to be critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition and accounts receivable  advertising and goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue related to product sales to patients who have placed orders upon shipment of such orders  provided that risk of loss has passed to the patient and we have received and verified any written documentation required to bill medicare  other government agencies  third party payers  and patients 
we record revenue at the amounts expected to be collected from government agencies  other third party payers  and directly from patients 
our billing system generates contractual adjustments based on government and third party fee schedules for each product shipment  as a result  estimates of contractual adjustments are not required 
revenue recognition is delayed for product shipments for which we have not yet received the required written documentation until the period in which the documentation is collected and verified 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including a review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  historical experience  and the credit worthiness of patients 
revenue related to medicare reimbursement is calculated based on government determined reimbursement prices for medicare covered items 
the reimbursements that medicare pays are subject to review by appropriate government regulators 
medicare reimburses at of the government determined prices for reimbursable supplies  and we bill the remaining balance either to third party payers or directly to patients 
the collectibility of our accounts receivable varies based on payer mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based primarily upon our evaluation of historical collection and write off experience  current industry conditions  industry reimbursement trends  credit policy  and on our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category 
the evaluation is performed at the end of each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
during the fiscal years ended march   and we provided for allowances for doubtful accounts of continuing operations at a rate of approximately  and of net revenues  respectively 
the reduction in the provision is primarily the result of a change in business mix due to the growth in revenues of our pharmacy segment and the acquisition of ndp that has a lower provision for bad debts than our other diabetes businesses 
days sales outstanding of accounts receivable balances increased to days as of march  from days as of march  due primarily to the re verification process initiated in the third quarter of fiscal the re verification project resulted in a shift of resources that delayed other accounts receivable management activities through fiscal  including the posting of cash and the billing to and collection from secondary patient and insurance account balances 
the implementation of a similar re verification process at ndp  which we acquired in august  also served to increase days sales outstanding 
additionally  the inclusion of accounts receivable of our liberty respiratory segment  which we sold in march  and for which the corresponding revenues are classified in discontinued operations  also served to increase days sales outstanding 
effective april   polymedica stipulated that diabetes and respiratory supplies could only be returned within six months from the date of sale  as compared with no limitations on product returns in the prior year 
we further revised our policy in december  to reduce the return policy for diabetes supplies from six months to three months 
for the fiscal year ended march   a hypothetical change of in the allowance for doubtful accounts provision as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million 
the following tables detail our gross accounts receivable balances by aging category from the billing date for each payer source for the fiscal years ended march  and aging of accounts receivable as of march  in thousands days total accounts payers outstanding outstanding outstanding outstanding receivable government medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients self pay total gross accounts receivable less accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable  net 
table of contents aging of accounts receivable as of march  in thousands days total accounts payers outstanding outstanding outstanding outstanding receivable government medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients self pay total gross accounts receivable less accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable  net in addition  we report sales allowances for estimated product returns as well as estimated claim denials as a reduction of gross revenue 
we analyze sales allowances using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume  patient demographics  business conditions and changes in our product return policy 
the reserve for sales allowances and the rate at which we provide for such allowances are periodically adjusted to reflect actual returns and claim denials 
changes in these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  we provided for sales returns and other sales allowances of continuing operations at a rate of approximately  and of gross revenues  respectively 
the decline in sales returns and other sales allowances as a percentage of gross revenues is primarily attributable to establishing a limitation on the length of time from the initial sale that a return will be authorized 
effective april   polymedica stipulated that diabetes and respiratory supplies could only be returned within six months from the date of sale  as compared with no limitations on product returns in the prior year 
we further revised our policy in december  to reduce the return policy for diabetes supplies from six months to three months 
for the fiscal year ended march   a hypothetical change of in the provision for sales returns and other sales allowances as a percentage of gross revenues would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million

we assess the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at the end of each reporting period by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net cash flows expected to result directly from such advertising 
management s judgments include determining the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized 
a business change  including a change in reimbursement rates  that reduces expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
for further discussion regarding the application of sop  please see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  we perform impairment tests at each reporting period and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing such tests  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions relating to the allocation of certain assets and liabilities to our reporting units  the fair values of our reporting units  and the related fair value of certain of their assets and liabilities 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used could affect the determination of whether an impairment exists as well as the quantification of the impairment value  should one exist 
for further discussion  please see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality we do not consider our business to be highly seasonal  however  advertising rates may fluctuate during the year  which may affect our acquisition of new patients 
we may purchase less advertising when rates are higher  which generally occurs in november and december 
as a result  our acquisition of new patients during this period is generally reduced and our net revenues may fluctuate accordingly 
other we operate from distribution facilities located in florida and virginia 
virtually all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
expense items include cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  each as more fully described below cost of sales consists primarily of purchased finished goods for sale in our markets and shipping and handling 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for personnel and benefits  amortization of capitalized direct response advertising costs  provision for bad debts  legal and related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  and other amortization and depreciation 
period to period comparisons of changes in net revenues are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period

during the fiscal year ended march   we added approximately  new patients from direct response advertising and the acquisition of diabetes companies and patient lists 
the attrition of approximately  patients in fiscal yielded net growth in the diabetes patient base from the prior year of approximately  patients or 
the acquisition of ndp contributed approximately million of revenues in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in pharmacy net revenues was due primarily to an increase in patients served  resulting in a increase in orders and an increase in the average revenue per shipment 
the primary sources of reimbursement in the pharmacy segment are currently commercial insurance and prescription drug cards 
patients without insurance coverage are required to pay for their medications at the time of purchase 
commencing january   medicare coverage of prescription drugs became available under part d through both prescription drug plans and medicare advantage prescription plans 
our strategy is to expand our pharmacy business by focusing our efforts to increase revenues from our approximately  active patients that currently order diabetes and pharmacy supplies from us 
however  the implementation of part d is still in its early stages 
we are currently unable to assess the long term impact of part d because of the uncertainty of the nature of the program  our ability to enroll new patients  successfully adjudicate claims and manage order timing

gross margins in the pharmacy segment increased primarily as a result of the increase in pharmacy net revenues

our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to federal or state tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying state or local income tax rates  and the deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  increased million primarily as a result of the gain recognized on the sale of our women s health products division on september   for million  net of income taxes  which included adjustments recorded in the six months ended march  this increase was offset by a decrease of million in net income generated by the liberty respiratory segment in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the prior year  primarily driven by a reduction in reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs and patient attrition 
in the process of preparing our year end financial statements  we reduced the gain recognized in the quarter ended september  on the sale of the women s health products division by million  net of income taxes 
please see note s to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on this adjustment

table of contents the following table details the number of the patient profiles acquired through business and patient list acquisitions in the fiscal year ended march  in thousands purchased date of purchase value patient count february  january  november  july  other patient list purchases total net revenue growth generated from the net growth in the patient base was reduced by a cut in medicare reimbursement for diabetes test strips and lancets effective january   which reduced net revenues by approximately million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  our growth during the fiscal year ended march  as compared with the prior year was also upset by the interruption in business resulting from the two hurricanes in the quarter ended september  sustained by our florida based facilities  home to the majority of our diabetes segment and pharmacy segment 
we have estimated that the hurricanes resulted in the permanent loss of approximately million of net revenues  excluding amounts reimbursed to us through our business interruption insurance  due to the timing of the hurricanes at the end of the second quarter  which prematurely ended the day supply cycle and could not be recovered 
the net revenue growth in our pharmacy segment was driven by a significant increase in patient orders 
pharmacy orders increased to  in the fiscal year ended march  from  orders in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of 
gross margin the following table presents segment gross margins and gross margin percentages for the fiscal years ended march  in thousands gross gross gross gross margin margin margin margin change gross margin diabetes pharmacy total gross margin gross margins in the fiscal year ended march  decreased primarily as a result of an increase in net revenues generated from lower margin prescription medication sales

discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended march   we reclassified the results of our women s health products division and liberty respiratory segment to discontinued operations as a result of the decision to make these divisions available for sale 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  increased million primarily as a result of the million impairment charge recorded in fiscal and the reduction in net revenues in fiscal resulting from the reduction in reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs and patient attrition 
the fiscal direct response advertising impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying value of liberty respiratory s direct response advertising asset down to its net realizable value as a result of the medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs implemented under the medicare modernization act 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash during the fiscal years ended march  in thousands change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased million from million as of march  to million as of march  the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fiscal year ended march   was largely driven by the repurchases of common stock for million  for which we paid approximately million in cash  borrowing the remainder from our credit facility 
this cash outflow was partially offset by million in proceeds recognized from the sale of our women s health products division and certain of our liberty respiratory assets 
the growth of our business is currently funded through cash flow generated from operations coupled with borrowings under our credit facility  which was increased to million as of march  and subsequently amended in april to million 
the million decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a million decrease in cash flows provided by discontinued operations due primarily to a reduction in reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs and patient attrition in the liberty respiratory segment  combined with lower cash collections than expected in the year ended march  days sales outstanding of accounts receivable balances increased to days as of march  from days as of march  due primarily to the re verification process initiated in the third quarter of fiscal the re verification project resulted in a shift of resources that delayed other accounts receivable management activities throughout fiscal  including the posting of cash and the billing to and collection from secondary patient and insurance account balances 
the implementation of a similar re verification process at ndp  which we acquired in august  also served to increase days sales outstanding 
furthermore  the inclusion of accounts receivable of our liberty respiratory segment  which we sold in march  and for which the corresponding revenues are classified in discontinued operations  also served to increase days sales outstanding 
net cash flows used for investing activities increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cash outflow was primarily due to the million purchases of ndp and intellicare  which were substantially funded through borrowings from the credit facility reduced by cash generated from the sale of discontinued operations which included million of net proceeds from the sale of our women s health products division on september  and the sale of certain of our liberty respiratory assets on march  during the fiscal year ended march   we also issued million in notes to agamatrix  a third party diabetes product supplier  to assist in their product development 
an increase of million in purchases of property  plant and equipment also contributed to the increase in cash flows used for investing activities 
also offsetting cash outflows were million of net proceeds recognized from maturing marketable securities 
net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million from a million inflow in the fiscal year ended march   to a million outflow in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was due primarily to the cash outflow of million incurred for the repurchase of over five million shares of polymedica common stock in the fiscal year ended march   primarily funded through borrowings from our credit facility 
we also spent million for the payment of debt issuance costs incurred to secure the credit facility and recognized million lower proceeds in the current year than in the prior year from the issuance of common stock resulting from fewer exercises of employee stock options

the weighted average interest rate was for the year ended march  a total origination fee of million and related costs of approximately  were paid and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the life of the credit facility 
the credit facility contains several financial and other covenants and is secured by a pledge of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
commitment fees on the unused portion of the facility range from 
to 
and are based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the most recent four fiscal quarters 
the credit facility limits the amount of indebtedness we may incur  requires us to maintain certain levels of net worth  leverage ratio and fixed charge ratio  and restricts our ability to materially alter the character of the business 
we continue to be in compliance with all of the covenants required by the credit facility 
our credit facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to million annually  as long as we do not breach the financial covenants contained in the agreement with the payment of such dividends 
during the fiscal year ended march   we repaid a million note payable related to the purchase of assets of national diabetic assistance corporation in january in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded approximately  of imputed interest expense

the court heard oral argument on the motion on june  on september   the court allowed the plaintiffs motion and certified the class 
on september   the defendants filed a petition requesting that they be permitted to appeal the decision to the first circuit court of appeals

on march   the court held an evidentiary hearing relating to class certification and on march  the court heard oral argument regarding class certification 
the court took the motion under advisement 
discovery is ongoing in the underlying suit 
the case is currently scheduled for trial in april we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the consolidated amended complaint and intend to contest the claims vigorously 
we are unable to express an opinion as to the likely outcome of this litigation 
an unfavorable outcome that exceeds amounts recoverable through our director and officer insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and other government agencies reserve the right to review submitted claim documentation in the normal course of business 
adequacy of capital resources we believe that our ending cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of march  of approximately million coupled with cash flow generated by operations and available credit facility funds  will be sufficient to meet working capital  planned capital expenditure investments  including the continued expansion of our call center in port st 
lucie to accommodate the expected additional call volume to be generated from the implementation of medicare s part d prescription drug benefit  and financing needs  including the payment of dividends to shareholders 
in the event that we undertake to make other acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may require substantial additional funding beyond currently available working capital  available credit facility funds  and funds generated from operations 
other factors which could negatively affect our liquidity include  among other things  a reduction in the demand for our products  an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation  or a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products 
sales of a significant portion of our diabetes segment depend on the continued availability of medicare reimbursement 
effective january   the medicare modernization act reduced reimbursement rates for diabetes test strips and lancets by approximately 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires that the cost of share based compensation  to both employees and non employees  be recognized in 
table of contents the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all share based compensation which includes shares  share options  and other equity instruments or which requires settlement by the issuance of an entity s shares or other equity instruments 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments  including the grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative  as is the current practice 
see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the consolidated financial statements for the current pro forma disclosure 
effective april   we will adopt the provisions of sfas r that require us to recognize the fair value of options granted in our basic financial statements 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under sfas changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded 
the compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under sfas  which was the straight line method  except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued 
any unearned or deferred compensation contra equity accounts related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option 
sfas r also changes the reporting of tax related amounts within the statement of cash flows 
the gross amount of windfall tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation will be reported as financing cash inflows 
under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows  any shortfalls resulting from the write off of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change in deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows 
we will adopt sfas r on a prospective basis beginning april  accordingly  the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations 
the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations  increasing selling  general and administrative expenses
