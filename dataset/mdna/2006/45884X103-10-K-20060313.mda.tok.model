item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including actimmune  co promotion and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview  which is incorporated herein by reference 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our sole marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item 
business license and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all of our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
our need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our advanced stage pulmonology pipeline and our research stage hepatology pipeline  apply for regulatory approvals and grow our operations 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of  we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and 
table of contents development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to curtail our development activities or cease operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
revenue is recognized at delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer and reserves are recorded for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in future periods 

table of contents inventory reserves and non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into non cancelable purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
at december   our minimum purchase obligations totaled million and are committed through the year of these commitments  we have million and million of outstanding fixed purchase order commitments that become due and payable in and  respectively 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in  in an effort to best manage the procurement and distribution of levels of actimmune  we successfully completed the necessary testing to extend the expiration period of actimmune from months to a total of months 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for all of our products  we also estimate the expiration dates of our products to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during and for excess inventories and non cancelable purchase obligations 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future quarters are substantially below our expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories and or non cancelable purchase obligations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a total of million  or per share  to cost of goods sold for excess inventory from previous years contractual purchases 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations for each of the comparative periods excludes infergen revenues and related expenses 
these amounts are reflected in discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the infergen product to valeant in december comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   intermune recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
net sales of actimmune for were million  compared to million for  a decline of 
for each of the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for approximately of our total net revenue and substantially all of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
actimmune sales declined during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in due to a decrease in the underlying demand for actimmune 
we believe that rate of patient referrals by physicians and the average duration of therapy are among the key uncertainties that affect demand for actimmune and our actimmune revenue and total product revenue 
the patient referral rate reflects the number of new patients who are prescribed actimmune and who call the call center that coordinates with all of our specialty distributors  although these patients may elect not to have those prescriptions filled 
we believe that the following factors are among those that may affect the patient referral rate for actimmune physician screening of patients who are likely to pursue treatment with actimmune  physician or patient interest  the publication of the results of our initial phase iii ipf clinical trial  gipf  in the new england journal of medicine and the negative editorial that accompanied the publication  and the extent to which physicians enroll their patients in our phase iii ipf clinical trial  gipf  who would otherwise be put on actimmune therapy 
during the year ended december   the patient referral rate that we observed for actimmune was significantly lower than for the same period in  
table of contents however  the average duration of therapy that we observed was greater than expected 
in  we expect actimmune revenue to be in a range of million to million 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenue and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total net revenue  in the corresponding period of the increase in cost of goods sold primarily reflects a charge of million taken for excess inventory from previous years contractual purchases compared to a million charge taken in for the same reason 
excluding these charges for excess inventory  cost of goods sold was approximately of total revenue for each of the years ended december  and in  we expect cost of goods sold to be approximately to of total revenue 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in the past  but we did not enter into any new contracts in amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the acquired product rights were related to the acquisition of amphotec and interferon gamma b patents 
in march  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge was based on our impairment review of the amphotec product rights  which took into account that sales levels were lower than expected and that amphotec was not aligned with our new strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
in may  we divested the amphotec product line  including all related assets  to three rivers for cash consideration 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase in reflects a greater level of spending to support our phase iii ipf clinical trials and our hcv protease inhibitor program 
the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology oncology anti infectives programs non specific total includes amounts related to oritavancin and amphotec  a substantial majority of the expenses related to oritavancin 

table of contents the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
based on our existing budgeted programs  we expect research and development expenses to be in a range of million to million in selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increased spending for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to million in expenses related to litigation  legal settlements and ongoing legal matters 
in  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be in a range of million to million  or a decrease of approximately to from continuing operations expense levels 
acquired research and development and milestone credits payments there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the years ended december  and included in our charges for was million for a milestone payable to eli lilly for oritavancin 
we initially expensed this amount as acquired research and development as oritavancin at the time was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses 
in connection with the divestiture of oritavancin to targanta in december  we have received a waiver from eli lilly for making this payment and thus reversed the accrued liability for this milestone 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan recommended by our chief executive officer and senior management that was designed to help streamline our operations and reduce our operating expenses in the plan  which consisted of a significant reduction in our investment in field based ipf disease awareness activities  was implemented concurrently with the divestiture of infergen in december these combined actions led to a significant headcount reduction of approximately employees and resulting termination costs of approximately million 
restructuring charges comprised approximately million of this amount which were recorded as a separate component of operating expenses in the statement of operations  with the remainder allocated to discontinued operations 
see loss from discontinued operations discussion below 
the majority of the employees left intermune at the end of the fourth quarter of  with the remainder expected to leave during the first quarter of 
table of contents the million restructuring charge was comprised of approximately million for cash severance and related benefits and approximately million for non cash stock compensation  consisting of an allocation of option acceleration costs for approximately  shares of our common stock 
we expect to pay out substantially all of the million severance and related benefits during the first quarter of interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income in the year ended december  reflects the increase in interest rates that we received on our invested cash and securities  partially offset by our declining cash and short term investment balances up to our receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of infergen in december interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in the year ended december  reflects the repurchase of all of our million convertible subordinated notes  and the impact of the lower interest rate on our million principal amount convertible senior notes  issued in february at the time of repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes  we paid accrued interest charges of million 
other income expense other income expense improved to income of million in the year ended december  compared to an expense of million in other income in included a million cash payment received from targanta in connection with the divestiture of oritavancin 
other expense of million for the year ended december  included a charge of million for the repurchase of all our outstanding million principal amount convertible subordinated notes  and the accelerated amortization of million of the deferred issuance costs associated with these notes 
also included in other expense for the year ended december  was a million foreign currency exchange loss on our unhedged foreign currency payables for inventory and clinical material purchases from bi at year end 
loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations reflects the divestiture of our infergen product line to valeant which was completed in december the loss from discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  compares to a loss of million in the year ended december  the components of the loss from discontinued operations for each of the years included net revenue of infergen  the related cost of goods sold and amortization of acquired product rights  as well as certain allocated research and development and selling general and administrative expenses specific to infergen 
the increased loss in compared to was the result of a greater level of sales and marketing expenses to support infergen  including the representative sales force hired in the fourth quarter of  and the full year impact of the phase iii trial of once daily treatment with infergen in combination with ribavirin therapy for hepatitis c peg nonresponder patients 
these increased expenses were offset by the gross margin on higher levels of infergen revenue see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the loss in also included employee termination costs of approximately million 
gain on sale of discontinued operations the gain on sale of discontinued operations in was comprised of the million in cash proceeds and a million note received from valeant in connection with the sale of infergen  offset by the net book value of the assets sold and direct transaction costs 
these assets included intellectual property rights  payments to a contract manufacturer  and inventory with a net book value of approximately million at the time of the transaction 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of direct transaction costs related to the sale of infergen 

table of contents provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   intermune recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
net sales of actimmune for were million  compared to million for  a decline of 
for the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenue  and substantially all of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
actimmune sales declined during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in due to a decrease in the underlying demand for actimmune 
during the year ended december   the patient referral rate that we observed for actimmune was significantly lower than for the same period in  however  the average duration of therapy that we observed was greater than observed in prior years 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenue and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  approximately of total net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total net revenue  in the corresponding period of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net revenue primarily reflects a charge of million recorded for obsolete inventory and contractual purchase commitments in excess of our forecasts compared to million in exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may adversely affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
we utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the acquired product rights related to the acquisition of amphotec and interferon gamma b patents 
the decrease for the period compared to the same period in was primarily due to a charge of million taken in the third quarter of for the impairment of amphotec product rights which reduced the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset being amortized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease in was largely attributable to the focusing of our research and development investment for clinical trials in the areas of hepatology 
table of contents and pulmonology and discontinuing a number of programs outside of these two core areas  particularly anti infectives 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
the slight decrease in spending reflected our intent not to increase our investment in other areas of our business while we focused our efforts and investments on expanding the infergen brand 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to infergen have been reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with our divestiture of infergen to valeant 
acquired research and development and milestone credits payments there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the year ended december  we recorded charges of million for acquired research and development and milestone payments for the year ended december  these charges related to milestone expenses recognized as a result of the commencement of a phase i clinical trial for peg alfacon and the eli lilly milestone for oritavancin discussed above 
we expensed these amounts as acquired research and development and milestone payments as peg alfacon and oritavancin were in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility  and had no foreseeable alternative future uses 
interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period ended december  the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  reflects declining investment funds in our cash and short term investments throughout the year in combination with lower interest rates earned 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period ended december  the decrease in interest expense in the year ended december  reflects the repurchase of all of our outstanding million principal amount convertible subordinated notes  and the impact of the lower interest rate on our million convertible senior notes 
other expense other expense of million for the year ended december  includes a charge of million for the repurchase of all million of our convertible subordinated notes due in july  and the accelerated amortization of million of the deferred issuance costs associated with these notes 
also  included in other expense for the year ended december  was a million foreign currency exchange loss on our unhedged foreign currency payables for inventory and clinical material purchases from bi at year end 
loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations reflects the divestiture of our infergen product line to valeant which was completed in december the loss from discontinued operations of million in the year ended december  compares to a loss of million in the year ended december  the components of the loss from discontinued operations for each of the years included net revenue of infergen  the related cost of goods sold and amortization of acquired product rights  as well as certain allocated research and development and selling general and administrative expenses specific to infergen 
the increased loss in compared to was the result of a greater level of sales and marketing expenses to support infergen  including the representative sales force hired in the fourth quarter of these increased expenses were offset by the gross margin on higher levels of infergen revenue 

table of contents provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the million increase was the result of the million in proceeds we received from the sale of infergen to valeant  partially offset by our cash used for operating activities of million and million in payments we made for manufacturing technology rights 
concurrent with our decision to divest infergen  we also made the decision to significantly reduce our investment in field based ipf disease awareness activities  which  when combined with the sale of our infergen assets  led to a significant headcount reduction of approximately full time equivalent employees and resulting cash severance and related benefit payments of approximately million in the first quarter of we believe that this headcount reduction will reduce our annual operating expenses by up to approximately million 
with the million in proceeds we received from the sale of our infergen assets  continued revenue from sales of actimmune and our reduced spending levels  we now believe we have sufficient capital to continue to fund our primary development programs for at least the next two years actimmune for ipf  pirfenidone for ipf and the hcv protease inhibitor program 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
operating activities used million in cash during the year ended december   primarily due to the loss from operations of million million excluding the expense reversal recognized as a result of eli lilly s waiver of a previously accrued milestone payment 
these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in accrued compensation of million and a decrease in inventory of million 
the increase in accrued compensation was due to the accruals made for the termination costs of approximately employees as a result of the divestiture of infergen and reduction in field based ipf disease awareness activities 
the decrease in inventory was primarily due to the million write off of excess inventory 
details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities provided million in cash flows during the year ended december   primarily due to the million in proceeds from the divestiture of infergen  partially offset by the million in payments made for manufacturing technology rights 
the cash outflows for manufacturing technology rights relate to the agreement that we signed with bi in november for the future clinical and commercial supply of infergen 
we assigned this agreement and all future rights and obligations thereunder to valeant as part of the sale of infergen to valeant in december we also had maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million  offset by million of available for sale securities purchases 
cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was due to the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties 
we have no loans with related parties  except for executive loans to dr 
marianne armstrong  our chief medical affairs and regulatory officer in the amount of million due april  and dr 
lawrence blatt  our chief scientific officer  in the amount of million due may 
both of these loans were in place prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act in we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement involves risks and 
table of contents uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the commercial performance of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our development and commercialization programs  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the pace of expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  in preparation for product launches  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations inventory non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development funding commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts included interest payments and principal amount of the convertible senior notes due these amounts consist of clinical and marketing related obligations 

table of contents the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates six to twelve months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 
the majority of our non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the purchase of actimmune inventory  which is denominated in euros 
we assumed an average foreign currency exchange rate of euros to us dollars of over the length of the agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values  beginning with the first quarterly period after june   with early adoption permitted 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates for sfas r such that we were allowed to adopt the new standard effective january  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we adopted sfas r on january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have been evaluating the requirements of sfas r as well as option valuation methodologies related to our employee and director stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
effective january   we expect to adopt the modified prospective method as our transition method and the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as provided by the provisions of sfas we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share 
the impact of adoption of sfas r will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future and the option valuation method used 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board opinions no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were recognized by including in net income during the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we believe that the adoption of statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  but we do not expect it to have a material effect 

table of contents material weakness and remediation in connection with management s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of december   we have concluded that we no longer have a material weakness in our financial statement close process  primarily related to the preparation and review of the annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnote disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the sec 
previous insufficient controls at december  included a lack of finance staff with the proficiency to interpret such principles and rules  and inadequate review and approval procedures to prepare external financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the sec 
as a result of last year s material weakness  management made material revisions to the annual consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures before they were issued 
in  we began an evaluation of our finance department staffing and as a result have terminated certain employees and hired additional personnel with technical accounting expertise to improve our financial statement close process 
we improved our financial statement close process throughout including the remediation of the material weakness discussed above by identifying  recruiting  and training personnel with the appropriate accounting and sec reporting skills 
please refer to item a of this annual report on form k for management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
our efforts to enhance our systems of internal control by adding additional qualified personnel and our continuing compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related audit of that assessment by our registered public accounting firm has required  and will continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
our internal control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our board of directors that our internal control over financial reporting is adequate  but there can be no guarantee that such controls will be effective 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits
