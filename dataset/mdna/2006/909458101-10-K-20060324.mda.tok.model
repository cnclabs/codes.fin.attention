while loans which are past due days or more as to interest or principal payments are considered for non accrual status  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral  in management s judgment  is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest 
these policies apply to both commercial and real estate loans 
potential problem loans as of december   in addition to the  of loans reported under item iii

in addition  management considered the level of charge offs on loans as well as the fluctuations of charge offs and recoveries on loans including the factors  which caused these changes 
estimating the risk of loans and the amount of loss is necessarily subjective 
accordingly  the allowance is maintained by management at a level considered adequate to cover losses that are currently anticipated based on past loss experience  general economic conditions  information about specific borrower situations including their financial position and collateral value and other factors and estimates which are subject to change over time

risk factors an investment in the corporation s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the corporation s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the corporation are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the corporation 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the corporation s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the corporation s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of the corporation s common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to the corporation s business the corporation is subject to interest rate risk the corporation s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the corporation s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the corporation receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the corporation s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the corporation s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the corporation s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the corporation s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to lending risk there are inherent risks associated with the corporation s lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the corporation operates as well as those across the state of ohio and the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
the corporation is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the corporation to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil monetary penalties against the corporation 
although the corporation does not have an inordinately large number of non performing loans  an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loans losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses may be insufficient the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and f uture trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the corporation s control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  the corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the corporation s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  the corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the corporation may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the corporation s ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the corporation s exposure to environmental liability 
although the corporation may perform an environmental re view before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of ohio the corporation s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of ohio and the specific local markets in which the corporation operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in allen  putnam  wood  sandusky and van wert counties 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the corporation s products and services as well as the ability of the corporation s customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the corporation s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securit ies markets or other factors could impact those local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area the corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets the corporation operates 
the corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  sec urities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of the corporation s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the corporation can 
the corporation s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the corporation s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which the corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors 
customer satisfaction with the corporation s level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the corporation s competitive position  which could adversely affect the corporation s growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision the corporation  primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary  the union bank company  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect the corporation s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the corporation to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and prod ucts the corporation may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputational damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
the corporation s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates the corporation s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the corporation s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition 
corporation relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue the corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiary 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the corporation s common stock  interest and principal on united s debt  and other operating expenses 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the corporation 
also  the corporation s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation  the corporation may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on the corporation s common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people the corporation s success depends  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the corporation can be intense and the corporation may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of the corporation s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s business because of their skills  knowledge of the corporation s market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
the corporation s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security the corporation relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the corporation s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the corporation s information systems could damage the corporation s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the corporation to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation continually encounters technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the corporation s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the corporation s operations 
many of the corporation s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technolog ical change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s business and  in turn  the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the corporation s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to the corporation s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to the corporation they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the corporation and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the corporations business severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the corporation s ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of the corporation s deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause the corporation to incur additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with the corporation s common stock the corporation s stock price can be volatile stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
the corporation s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations 
recommendations by securities analysts 
operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the corporation 
news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry 
perceptions in the marketplace regarding the corporation and or its competitors 
new technology uses  or services offered  by competitors 
significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the corporation or its competitors 
failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions 
changes in government regulations 
geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause the corporation s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 
an investment in the corporation s common stock is not an insured deposit the corporation s common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in the corporation s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire the corporation s common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
the corporation s articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain banking laws may have an anti takeover effect provisions  of the corporation s articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the corporation  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the corporation s shareholders 
the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of the corporation s common stock 
risks associated with the corporation s industry the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions the corporation s operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which the corporation operates  all of which are beyond the corporation s control 
deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the corporation s products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  the corporation may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
the corporation may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s business and  in turn  the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations
