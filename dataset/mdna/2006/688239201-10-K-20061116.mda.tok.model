executive overview the company s financial performance in fiscal compared to fiscal and its expectations for its financial performance in fiscal year follow percentage increase vs 
prior year fiscal fiscal estimate sales operating income net income earnings per share assuming dilution company estimates as of october  estimates are exclusive of the estimated impact of acquiring jlg 
the company experienced sales and operating income growth in all three of the company s segments for fiscal as business conditions were favorable in all segments 
these results were partially offset by substantially higher corporate expenses related to higher acquisition investigation and related costs as the company pursued a transformational acquisition strategy  higher personnel costs  including costs related to the adoption of sfas no 
r and costs to start up an office in china 
the company s fire and emergency segment experienced sales growth of in fiscal and an operating income increase of 
the company believes that markets served in this segment exhibited slow  steady growth in fiscal and that market share gains largely contributed to the double digit percentage growth in sales in fiscal since the onset of operation iraqi freedom in  including fiscal  the company s defense segment has benefited substantially from increasing us department of defense dod requirements for new trucks  parts  service  armoring and remanufacturing of the company s defense vehicles operated in iraq 
during fiscal  the company s defense segment continued to outperform the prior year as a result of increasing requirements for heavy payload and remanufactured trucks largely arising from conflicts in iraq and afghanistan 
these factors caused the company s defense sales and operating income to increase and  respectively  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
operating income margins in fiscal benefited from adjustments totaling million related to an increase in the margin on the medium tactical vehicle replacement mtvr base contract and the recovery of pre contract costs previously expensed on an armoring contract 
these contracts were concluded in fiscal sales in the company s commercial segment increased in fiscal and operating income increased 
the increase in sales was largely attributable to strong demand at the company s north american businesses in advance of diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january  for diesel engines in the classes of chassis the company sells and or utilizes for mounting of the company s vehicle bodies and higher unit sales at the company s european refuse business offset in part by a lower mix of package sales involving both a commercial vehicle chassis and vehicle body 
the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher unit volume  improved pricing and improved product mix in the company s north american operations and the return to profitability of the company s european refuse business in fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million in the comparable period in the prior year 
the prior year s operating loss included a million charge for workforce reductions at the company s european refuse facilities 
the remaining improvement in operating income for the european refuse operation was primarily the result of increased sales volume  cost reduction activities and the restructuring of that business in fiscal to reduce costs 
domestic orders within the segment were particularly strong in fiscal due to a pre buy in advance of the emissions standards change 
at september   the company s backlog in its commercial segment was up as compared to september  in fiscal  the company estimates that its sales  on a stand alone basis excluding the impact of the pending jlg acquisition  will increase to billion and that its earning per share will increase to per share 
the company believes that its defense segment sales and operating income will increase in fiscal over fiscal  despite the scheduled completion of the production phase of the uk wheeled tanker contract in the first quarter of fiscal  given the duration and intensity of operation iraqi freedom and the us army s modularity initiative  which  among other things  are expected to increase the dod s requirements for the company s tactical trucks and for the remanufacturing of such trucks damaged in the conflict 
the company likewise expects its operating income to increase in its fire and emergency and commercial segments in fiscal due to the benefits of the fiscal acquisitions of ak and imt and its price increase and cost reduction initiatives  which the company expects will more than offset the impact of any demand decreases expected in fiscal from the effects of the diesel engine emissions standards changes 
the company expects the completion of its acquisition of jlg for billion to significantly transform its business in fiscal and set the foundation for future growth prospects 
the company expects the transaction to close in december however  the company cannot provide any assurance that it will complete the transaction 
jlg had sales of billion and operating income of million  including a million gain on the sale of certain assets  in its fiscal year ended july  jlg estimated on september  that its sales would grow by to in its fiscal year ending july  accordingly  jlg is a large acquisition relative to oshkosh s stand alone sales and operating income estimates for its fiscal year ended september  of to billion and to million  respectively 
the company agreed to acquire jlg to support its sales and earnings growth rate objective of or more  diversify to complement its defense business and balance the economic and geopolitical cycles faced by the company  provide scale in procurement and global reach to better compete in its markets  and execute within its long term acquisition strategy which seeks to acquire market leaders in growing markets with the objective of earning superior returns for shareholders 
the company anticipates that the integration of jlg s business and practices with oshkosh will be a major effort that will consume much of its management s time for about two years 
the acquisition will substantially increase the company s financial leverage and expose the company to non residential construction spending cycles 
the company understands the integration  leverage and other risks of the pending acquisition  but believes that the jlg acquisition offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the company s estimate of strong non residential construction spending in and and synergy opportunities  to diversify and balance its business segments and to provide the scale needed for the company to sustain growth 
the company further believes that the current strength in its own defense business and in its estimates for the near term outlook for jlg s business significantly mitigate the financial leverage risks of the acquisition and will permit the company to substantially reduce its financial leverage over the next few years 
the company estimates that the jlg acquisition will be modestly accretive to its fiscal stand alone estimated earnings and anticipates higher accretion for the acquisition in fiscal the company expects to provide further detailed estimates regarding the impact of the jlg acquisition in february  at the time of the company s next earnings conference call  which follows the expected closing for the acquisition

fiscal outlook the company estimates that fiscal consolidated net sales will range between billion and billion  an increase from fiscal net sales of to 
the company estimates the acquisitions of ak and imt will add million to sales in fiscal because fiscal results only included their results  including sales of million since the dates of acquisition 
all estimates and comparisons are to fiscal and exclude the impact of the anticipated jlg acquisition 
the company expects the fire and emergency segment sales growth percentage to be in the mid teens in fiscal  as a result of an estimated mid single digit organic growth and the addition of ak 
the company estimates the acquisition of ak will add million to segment sales in fiscal because fiscal results only included its operation  including sales of million since the date of acquisition 
the organic growth reflects lower industry demand following the diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january as well as anticipated price increases and some market share gains 
the company projects defense segment sales to increase by million to million in fiscal due to additional federal funding which includes requirements for new trucks to meet the dod s requirements for operation iraqi freedom  while it projects defense parts and service sales to approximate fiscal sales 
the company estimates the commercial segment s sales to decrease in the low single digit percentage range in fiscal due to lower industry demand for concrete mixers and refuse packers in the us subsequent to the diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january  partially offset by the addition of imt 
the company estimates the acquisition of imt will add million to segment sales in fiscal because fiscal results only included its operation  including sales of million since the date of acquisition 
the company projects that demand for concrete placement and domestic refuse products in calendar will decline about to due to the diesel engine emissions standards changes 
since the company s fiscal year straddles the effective date of the standards changes  the company does not expect the decline to affect it until sometime after the first quarter of fiscal the company expects that geesink norba group refuse product sales will also be down slightly in fiscal due to slow demand in the united kingdom and the lack of available chassis in france 
the company is projecting consolidated operating income to be up between and in fiscal resulting in operating income of between million and million 
the company is projecting fire and emergency segment margins to be up basis points in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting benefits of cost reduction initiatives 
the company expects that ak s operating income margins will exceed in fiscal the company is projecting defense segment operating income margins to remain relatively flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the commercial segment  the company projects operating income margins to be up over basis points in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of imt  continued profitability at the company s european refuse business and the benefits of cost reduction initiatives 
the company expects that imt operating income margins will exceed in fiscal the company estimates that corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations will increase million to approximately million in fiscal the increase reflects the addition of a new data center and investment in additional staff 
the company estimates that interest expense net of interest income and other expenses will increase million to million in fiscal due to indebtedness incurred to fund the ak and imt acquisitions 
the company estimates that in fiscal its effective income tax rate will decrease approximately to  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates will approximate million and minority interest in earnings will approximate million 
these estimates result in the company s estimate of fiscal net income between million and million and earnings per share between and per share 
the company expects its earnings per share to be down in the first quarter of fiscal to to per share compared to per share in the first quarter of fiscal due to a tough comparison quarter in the prior year and the later timing of estimated new and remanufactured defense truck sales 
the company estimates that about of its estimated annual earnings per share in fiscal will be realized in its third and fourth quarters 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
the company records revenues under certain long term  fixed price defense contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally using either the cost to cost or units accepted method as the measurement basis for effort accomplished 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on management estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
estimated amounts for contract changes and claims are included in contract sales only when realization is estimated to be probable 
assumptions used for recording sales and earnings are recognized as a cumulative life to date adjustment in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs 
in the period in which it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged to cost of sales 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent with the application of the cost to cost method of accounting affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect the cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  overhead rate estimates  revised estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices  and customer specification changes 
if business conditions were different  or if the company had used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements 
bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred 
in fiscal  following completion of contractually required performance testing  the company began initial deliveries of wheeled tanker systems comprised of a truck chassis and water or fuel tank trailer under a multi year requirements contract with the uk mod 
the contract  valued at million british sterling million  calls for delivery of wheeled tanker systems over a month period beginning in february the contract provides that the company is paid within days of delivery of the wheeled tanker systems to the uk mod 
the uk mod has up to days following system delivery to reject the delivered wheeled tanker systems 
wheeled tanker systems remain in the company s inventory and cash received in payment for these systems is recorded as deferred revenue until the earlier of the date that the wheeled tanker system has been accepted by the customer or the date the rejection right lapses generally days from system delivery at which time the company recognizes revenue 
sales in fiscal under this contract totaled million 
goodwill and other intangible assets in conformity with us gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
indicators of potential impairment include situations involving significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulators  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  changes in technology or markets and operating losses  among others 
the company performs its annual review in the fourth quarter of each year 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
reporting units are business components at or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets become impaired 
any impairment review is  by its nature  highly judgmental as estimates of future sales  earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values 
however  the company believes that it has conducted thorough and competent valuations of its goodwill and other intangible assets annually  resulting in no impairment of goodwill 
see critical accounting estimates 
warranty sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
product liability due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s concrete placement and domestic refuse businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire and emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company maintained self insured retentions of million per claim for each of its businesses 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
critical accounting estimates management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
warranty the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring company obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology  there may be a different  higher level of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
business combinations 
the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
to aid in establishing the value of goodwill and other intangible assets at the time of acquisition  the company typically involves a professional appraisal company 
goodwill in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
in making this assessment  management estimates discounted anticipated cash flows of a reporting unit based on a number of factors including historical operating results  business plans and market conditions 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the company s estimated cost of capital at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
while the company s geesink norba group reported operating income of million in fiscal  its fourth quarter performance resulted in a loss 
in addition  its backlog was down as of september  due to a decrease in orders in the united kingdom and france 
as a result of this loss and decrease in backlog  the company continued to monitor whether an impairment of the geesink norba group goodwill had occurred 
goodwill associated with the geesink norba group  which was recorded in connection with the acquisition of this business in july  totaled million as of september  million based on the exchange rate as of september  
most of the european refuse markets served by the geesink norba group have been in a recession since while experiencing a slight improvement in fiscal and  the company believes that refuse collection vehicle market sales volumes in europe declined by more than from fiscal levels to fiscal levels and that pricing in several of its markets declined by to over this period 
during fiscal  the company launched a new geesink branded  smooth sided  rear loader refuse collection vehicle and the valu pak  value priced refuse collection vehicle into the european refuse market to spur demand for the company s products 
following the launch of the new geesink branded rear loader  its product cost substantially exceeded the company s estimated product cost and initial production units involved substantial warranty claims until certain design changes were made in fiscal and these issues caused the geesink norba group to begin reporting operating losses in the business in the quarter ended june  the company made a management change and assigned its lean team to the business in early fiscal to resolve the product design issues and to substantially reduce the manufacturing costs of the geesink branded rear loader 
as a result of these initiatives  the company recorded a million workforce reduction charge in fiscal to rightsize its workforce in the netherlands and to commence a strategy to outsource certain activities to lower cost manufacturing sites 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  the geesink norba group returned to profitability 
during the fourth quarter  the united kingdom market began to decline as a result of a decrease in government funding and the consolidation of two of geesink s primary customers in that country 
in addition  limited chassis availability in france reduced orders in that country 
the company expects that the business will incur operating losses through the first two quarters of fiscal  but that the business will be modestly profitable in fiscal the company believes that profitability will continue to improve in fiscal following the improvement of the markets in the united kingdom and france  additional cost reduction activities and other planned actions 
based largely on the company s estimated benefits of its cost reduction initiatives in fiscal and and the improvement in the end markets  the company developed long term projections of estimated cash flows from the geesink norba group to assess the fair value of the business 
as a result  the company determined that the fair value of the geesink norba group exceeded its carrying value at september   and therefore determined that the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of the geesink norba group was not impaired 
although any assessment of goodwill is dependent on projections of future operating results  the company believes that it conducted a thorough and competent valuation of the geesink norba group at september  in support of its assessment 
the company intends to continue to review the results of its initiatives and to monitor the valuation of its investment in the geesink norba group as appropriate during fiscal to the extent that the geesink norba group is not able to achieve expected sales and operating income performance in fiscal and fiscal  the company could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge 
the range of potential charge would be based on a number of factors  including the speed of the european economic recovery  the results of the company s cost reduction activities  geesink norba group s operating performance  competition  required future capital expenditures  interest rates and long term growth assumptions 
the company cannot provide any assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
deferred income tax assets the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company will require future taxable income in the netherlands in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction 
at september   a valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the net deferred tax asset related to tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands 
benefit plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data

as of september  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog at september  decreased to  million compared to  million at september  fire and emergency segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to improving domestic municipal markets  market share gains and the inclusion of million of backlog related to ak  which was acquired in fiscal the defense segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to  million at september  due to timing of fhtv contract renewal  continued production under uk wheeled tanker contract and a slow down in sales of parts and services for the dod 
the company anticipates that its defense segment backlog will rise over the next six months as dod contracts are executed against recent federal budget bills 
commercial segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  orders continued to remain strong in north america in advance of diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january  unit backlog for refuse packers was up domestically 
unit backlog for front discharge and rear discharge concrete mixers was up and  respectively 
unit backlog for refuse packers was down in europe as a result of slow order intake in the united kingdom and chassis supply issues in france 
approximately million of the overall increase in commercial segment backlog related to imt  which the company acquired in fiscal approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr  id iq and lvsr contracts 
as of september   only million of the anticipated lvsr contract has been funded and included in backlog 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company has not historically utilized derivative securities to fix variable rate interest obligations or to make fixed rate interest obligations variable 
if short term interest rates averaged two percentage points higher in fiscal than in fiscal  then the company s interest expense would increase  and pre tax income would decrease by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  but do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure other than as noted 
commodity risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s fire and emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom  italy  sweden  mexico and romania and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities throughout the us and in various european jurisdictions 
international sales were approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately of overall net sales in fiscal that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
for the company s us operations  the company generally purchases materials and component parts that are denominated in us dollars and seeks customer payment in us dollars for large multi unit sales contracts  which span several months or years 
the company s contract to provide wheeled tankers to the uk mod provides that the company shall invoice and be paid in british sterling 
the company s costs under this contract are payable in us dollars  british sterling and euro 
the company has instituted a hedging program by entering into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts to sell british sterling and euro and purchase british sterling and euro to hedge a portion of the related us dollar equivalent of these amounts 
should significant changes occur in the actual timing of forecasted british sterling receipts under the uk wheeled tanker contract  the underlying forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as a hedge of such forecasted receipts may become partially ineffective which could lead to unintended earnings volatility 
the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies primarily as a result of the effects of the translation of the geesink norba group  bai and london earnings from source currencies into us dollars and euro denominated purchases of tank bodies and tank pumping systems in the defense segment  and hedging customer orders denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company may use forward foreign exchange contracts to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations in exchange rates on non us dollar denominated sales and purchases 
at september   the company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase million euro million based on the exchange rate as of september  for settlement during the period from october through january at september   the company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to sell million british sterling million based on the exchange rate as of september  for settlement during the period from october through november to hedge outstanding firm sales commitments 
a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have had a material impact on the company s fiscal earnings or cash flows 
however  to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements may also affect the company s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices  the company s cost structure compared to its competitors cost structures and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the company s shareholders equity 
amounts invested in the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
in connection with the company s acquisition of bai in july  the company borrowed million under its bank credit facility and designated such borrowing as a hedge of the company s net investment in bai 
as such  the impact of fluctuations in the us dollar equivalent of the million euro denominated debt is charged or credited directly to shareholders equity  offsetting  in part  adjustments to shareholders equity to record the cumulative translation of the company s investment in bai 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of shareholders equity increased million in fiscal net of the million adjustment related to the bai net investment hedge 
using the year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in non us subsidiaries at september  was approximately million 
the following table quantifies firmly committed sales contracts and forecasted purchase requirements which are denominated in foreign currencies and related outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge those foreign currency exposures
