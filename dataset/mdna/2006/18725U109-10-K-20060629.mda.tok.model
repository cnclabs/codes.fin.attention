the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions including  among other things 
table of contents our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize our products  our ability to successfully design and conduct our planned clinical trials  our ability to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in our acquisitions  and to successfully integrate the operations  business and technology obtained in our acquisitions  general economic and business conditions in our markets  the impact of current  pending or future legislation and regulation of our businesses in the us and abroad  our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance  financing plans and the impact of competition  and the impact of technological developments and competition 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  the forward looking events and circumstances discussed in this annual report on form k might not occur 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein because of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview our business activities are reported in four operating segments i molecular services  which is comprised of the recently acquired operations of genaissance  icoria and genome express pharmacogenomic and molecular services segment  ii sales of diagnostic equipment  consumables and services to pols pol segment  iii sales of diagnostic equipment  consumables and services to small to medium sized clinics  hospitals and laboratories clinics and small hospitals segment  and iv all other activities  which includes corporate related items  results of insignificant operations and income and expense not allocated to reportable segments 
as a result of the acquisitions of genaissance on october  and icoria on december   we believe we are now a worldwide leader in providing molecular services  pharmacogenomics  genetic testing and clinical diagnostics to improve patient care 
our molecular services segment is among the largest independent providers of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics services globally 
our genomic services are marketed to the pharmaceutical  biotech  clinical  academic  government and agricultural marketplaces 
we are utilizing pharmacogenomics to develop genetic based tests and diagnostics and more efficacious therapeutics by finding genetic markers to guide drug development and utilization 
our therapeutic product  vilazodone for depression  is in phase iii clinical development 
our future success in molecular services will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the genomics field  a field that has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant change 
in addition  the competition in the pharmacogenomic and molecular services market is intense and includes pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government and other publicly funded agencies  both in the us and abroad 
our future success in this highly competitive market depends on our ability to demonstrate that our recently acquired technology platforms  know how  and informatics technologies and capabilities are superior to those of such competitors and our ability to advance technologies and genetic testing franchises 
in addition  we must continue to contain costs and move toward profitability while growing revenues wherever possible 
funding the continued development of vilazodone is another challenge that we face in our molecular services business 
we currently do not have the cash reserves or the revenue from other sources to fund such development 
in order to successfully commercialize this drug candidate  we will be required to either partner with a third party that has sufficient resources or raise capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities 
establishing a partnership with another company could have an impact on the future revenues we can expect to receive from 
table of contents vilazodone if we have to share some portion of such revenues with a development partner 
additionally  fund raising could serve to dilute our stockholders ownership of us 
we also face challenges with respect to our recent acquisitions 
integrating the operations and personnel of genaissance and icoria will require significant efforts from each company  including the coordination of product development  sales and marketing efforts and administrative operations and will be a time consuming and complex process 
given that both genaissance and icoria have a history of incurring significant net losses  we face the challenge of successfully integrating genaissance and icoria into businesses that will generate sufficient revenue to become profitable and will sustain profitability if they do become profitable and alleviating the need for ongoing capital raises 
with respect to our diagnostic instrumentation operations  revenues from clinical laboratory testing are anticipated to grow as a result of the aging of the population  increased healthcare awareness and expanding insurance coverage 
the present focus  however  on greater efficiency in disease management and on reducing health care costs exposes our customers to a constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  in order to remain competitive and gain market share in these growing markets  it is essential for us to continue to provide cost effective technologies and services 
competition in the medical products industry  which includes our diagnostic instrumentation  reagent and consulting services businesses  is intense and expected to increase as new products  technologies and services become available and new competitors enter the market 
our competitors in the united states  europe and asia pacific are numerous and include  among others  large  multi national diagnostic testing and medical products companies 
our future success depends upon maintaining a competitive position in the development and distribution of products  technologies and services in its areas of focus in pols and smaller clinical laboratories 
in order to grow  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products  technologies and services  and invest in research and development

changes in foreign currency rates a portion of our balance sheet is denominated in euros  the functional currency of our dutch operations  and a minor portion of our balance sheet is denominated in australian dollars 
the effect of translation of these local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and have not been material to the financial statements 
the euro strengthened against the us dollar by during fiscal and during fiscal from the respective prior fiscal year s closing rates 
the results of our european operations can be significantly impacted by changes in these foreign exchange rates 
periodically we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the exposure to currency fluctuations on customer accounts receivable denominated in foreign currency 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating results 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
there were foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of  outstanding at march  the fair value of these instruments at march  was de minimis 
gains and losses related to these derivative instruments for fiscal and were not significant 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory  intangibles  goodwill  accrued expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenues from the sale of diagnostic equipment and consumables are recognized at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from maintenance services on equipment is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenue from maintenance services performed for customers who do not have a maintenance agreement is recognized using the completed contract method 
revenues from consulting services provided to pols are generally fixed fee arrangements and such revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the consulting contract as services are delivered 
along with the sale of products  training and installation services are provided to the end user customer  and such revenues are recognized as the products are delivered or as service are provided  with all revenue measured using objective fair value 
revenues from the molecular services segment are derived from licenses of intellectual property  commercial partnerships and government contracts and grants 
payments from commercial contracts are generally related to service fees  milestone achievements and deliveries of molecular services data or assays 
payments for service fees and milestone achievements are recognized as revenues on a progress to completion basis over the term of the respective contract  except with respect to refundable fees for which revenue recognition does not commence until the refund right expires 
revenues recognized under the progress to completion method are calculated based on applicable output measures  such as a comparison of the number of genes analyzed to the total number of genes to be analyzed  assessed on a contract by contract basis 
to the extent payments received exceed revenue recognized for each contract or grant  the excess portion of such payments is recorded as deferred revenues 
to the extent revenues recognized exceed payments received for each contract or grant  the excess revenues are recorded as accounts receivable 
revenue related to molecular services deliveries are recognized upon the later of delivery or  if applicable  customer acceptance 
payments received under the company s commercial contracts and government contracts and grants are generally non refundable regardless of the outcome of the future research and development activities to be performed by the company 
payments from government contracts and grants  which are typically cost plus arrangements  are recognized as revenues as related expenses are incurred over the term of each contract or grant 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances of million   and  at march   and  respectively  are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information known to us regarding customers credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory quantities are periodically reviewed and  when necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are provided 
on an ongoing basis  we review the carrying value of the inventory and record an inventory impairment 
table of contents charge at such time as it is believed that the carrying value exceeds the inventory s net realizable value 
such assessments are based upon historical sales  forecasted sales  market conditions and information derived from our sales and marketing professionals 
in addition  certain of our products are perishable  and in the event that the product is not sold before the expiration date  a full valuation reserve against such inventory is provided as soon as it is determined that the product is no longer marketable due to the expiration date 
the product is then disposed and written off 
valuation of intangibles as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we completed four business combinations during fiscal and three business combinations during fiscal in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  the transactions have been accounted for based on fair value 
as a result of the purchase price allocations  we recorded purchased total intangibles of million and goodwill totaling million in the molecular services segment  goodwill of million in clinics and small hospitals segment and purchased intangibles of million and goodwill totaling million in the pol segment 
the fair value of the purchased intangibles was determined by independent third party appraisal based on either discounted probable cash flows or replacement costs 
the interest rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on the company s weighted average cost of capital ranging from between and 
for a description of the purchased intangibles and their respective fair values  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our recorded intangibles can be impacted by economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill using december as our selected annual evaluation date 
changes in fair value could result in future impairment charges if the fair value of the reporting units or asset groups to which these long lived assets are associated are determined to be less than the carrying value of such assets 
as of december   the most recent evaluation date  there was no impairment of such goodwill 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when facts and circumstances suggest that there may be an impairment  we will assess the carrying value of amortizing intangibles  including purchased intangibles and capitalized software 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the assets present in that operations 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  such intangibles are written down to their respective fair values 
the results of these periodic impairment tests can be impacted by our future expected operating results and cash flows  economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which clinical data and its customers operate 
no impairment charges have been recognized for the periods presented in this annual report 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high  and revenue may be overstated or understated to the extent such expenses relate to collaborations accounted for using the progress to completion method 
the date on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our 
table of contents actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  after limitation for the change in ownership  of million  which expire starting in  federal research and development credit carryforwards of million and a net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of a change in ownership  this occurred when we purchased genaissance and icoria 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues consolidated revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  of which approximately million of the increase was generated by genaissance and icoria since their dates of acquisition 
product revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased sales in clinics and small hospitals 
services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues include million for molecular services due to inclusion of the genaissance and icoria operations 
service revenues in the pol segment decreased approximately  due primarily to a change in the market for such services 
gross profit gross profit on product sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to improved pricing and cost control 
gross profit from services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of genaissance s and icoria s services operations since acquisition 
service activities at genaissance and icoria generate lower gross margins than those in pols and clinics and small hospitals and clinics 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to i the inclusion of approximately million of sales and marketing expenses incurred by genaissance and icoria since their dates of acquisition and ii higher personnel costs and sales commissions related to increased sales in the clinics and small hospitals segment and the promotion of new products in the pol segment 
we expect the sales and marketing expenses to increase significantly over the next months as we integrate and build our sales and marketing function for molecular services 
research and development expense research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of approximately million of research and development expenses incurred by genaissance and icoria since their dates of acquisition 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of approximately million of general and administrative expenses incurred by genaissance and icoria since their dates of acquisition and to increased professional fees incurred primarily as a result of the recent mergers and other financing activities 
we expect the general and administrative expenses to decrease over the next months as we continue to integrate genaissance and icoria and increase operational efficiencies 
purchased research and development expense purchased research and development expenses of million in fiscal represents the fair value of the in process research and development projects at genaissance of million and at icoria of million at their dates of acquisition 
since the costs relate to projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative use at their dates of acquisition  the costs were expensed in fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest expense increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility  additional capital leases to fund fixed asset purchases  debt assumed in the acquisition of genaissance and icoria and to higher average interest rates 
interest income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to net proceeds of million received from the private equity placement in november and to higher average interest rates 
other income expense  net of  in fiscal and  in fiscal primarily represents foreign currency losses and gains 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal although we incurred a loss in fiscal  the in process research and development expense is not tax deductible in the united states and no tax benefit was recorded on the operating losses in the united states as the deferred tax asset may not be realized 
in addition  we recorded a tax provision for the income from our foreign operations 
the fiscal effective rate represents the federal statutory rate with adjustments for the foreign tax rate differentials and state taxes payable in the united states 
we expect that for the forseeable future that we will not be able to benefit from our losses in the us preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends of  represent dividends accrued and or paid during fiscal on the series a preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of genaissance 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues consolidated revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to a sales mix more heavily weighted to higher priced equipment and to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
service revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to offering in house field services to customers versus customers contracting with a third party for those services  and to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
gross profit gross profit on product sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a favorable sales mix of higher margin instruments and to an unusually low margin in 
table of contents fiscal the low margin in fiscal was primarily due to a million charge to cost of sales relating to the write up of the inventory acquired in the april mergers to fair value 
in accordance with purchase accounting  this charge was due to the elimination of the manufacturing profit on the acquired inventories 
gross profit from services revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to the absorption of certain fixed expenses  including the costs of quality control  service and associated overhead costs over a larger revenue base 
research and development expense research and development expenses increased approximately  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to i the amortization of prior years costs on certain projects in the clinics and small hospitals segment previously capitalized per sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  as the level of activity decreased in fiscal and ii an increase in activity associated with the development of new pol products 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the sales and marketing expenses in the clinics and small hospitals segment increased approximately  in fiscal due primarily to the retention of a sales agent in china and to increased marketing activities such as advertising 
sales and marketing costs decreased approximately  in fiscal in the pol segment due to lower advertising costs and fewer marketing programs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from million in fiscal to million in the general and administrative expenses in the clinics and small hospitals segment increased approximately  primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in bad debt expense as the allowance for doubtful accounts was increased to cover one customer whose financial condition was deteriorating 
sales and marketing costs increased approximately  in the pol segment in fiscal due to an increase in finance personnel and related employee benefit expenses and expenses incurred in preparation for sarbanes oxley section compliance 
interest and other income expense  net interest expense decreased  or  in fiscal due to a lower outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility  partially offset by an increase in the levels of long term debt and the capital lease obligations 
interest income in fiscal approximated the prior year s amount 
other income expense  net of  in fiscal and  in fiscal primarily represents foreign currency losses and gains 
provision for income taxes the effective rate was in fiscal versus in fiscal the effective rate in fiscal represents the federal statutory rate with adjustments for the foreign tax rate differentials and state taxes payable in the united states 
the effective rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of previously established valuation allowances on domestic net operating loss carryforwards as such net operating losses were deemed to be realizable beginning in as a result of the factors described above  net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at march  we generated net cash flow of million during as compared to million in fiscal the increased net cash flow in fiscal was primarily due to the issuance of common stock and other equity instruments and to borrowings under debt financing arrangements 

table of contents our acquisitions in fiscal were completed by the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of common stock   shares of preferred stock  the assumption of  common stock warrants  the assumption of  common stock options and approximately million in cash and loans 
in addition  on november   we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock  for million  net of associated costs of  to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors  including certain members of our board of directors 
the unit price was  which equaled the closing bid price of our common stock on nasdaq on the closing date  plus per share 
the exercise price of the warrants is  equaling a twenty percent premium on the closing bid price of the common stock on nasdaq on the closing date 
the warrants are exercisable beginning may  through the close of business on may  on february   we provided notice to the holders of the warrants that we were accelerating the initial exercise date of the warrants for a period limited to five days beginning at pm on february   and ending at pm on february  during this period  certain warrant holders exercised their right to purchase  shares of our common stock  resulting in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately million

on june   we closed a private placement of common stock in which we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  after transaction expenses of approximately  to certain institutional investors  including certain members of our board of directors 
the unit price was  which equaled the closing bid price of our common stock on nasdaq on the closing date  plus per share 
the exercise price of the warrants is  equaling a twenty percent premium on the closing bid price of the common stock on nasdaq on the closing date 
the warrants are exercisable beginning december  through the close of business on june  our sources of cash as of june   include our cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  existing lines of credit  cash flows from certain operations of certain divisions  and possible future equity and or debt financings 
our projected uses of cash include cash used in operations of certain operating divisions  capital expenditures  existing debt service costs and continued development of potential products through internal research  collaborations and  possibly through strategic acquisitions 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have completed four business combinations since october  as part of our strategy  we continually evaluate possible mergers  acquisitions and investments 
the financing of such activities is evaluated as part of our review of any opportunity 
at currently projected rates of expenditure  we believe that additional funding will be required to operate the company through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  including the funding of phase iii clinical trials for our lead drug candidate  vilazodone 
to reduce our cash utilization  we are working to accelerate the integration of genaissance and icoria into our operations 
we are considering several options for raising additional funds such as public or private offerings of equity or debt  or other financing arrangements 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing 
table of contents will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  including our efforts related to vilazodone  hap and other new technologies  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to minimize some of these risks by using foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks 
factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure  not for speculation 
interest rate risk we use a combination of fixed rate term loans  variable rate lines of credit and fixed rate leases to finance our activities 
our term loans and leases are all at fixed rates over their lives and carry no interest rate risk 
as a result of our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
as of march   we had million outstanding on our domestic line of credit carrying an interest rate of over prime and a convertible note with an outstanding balance of million carrying an interest rate of over prime 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense 
foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs  using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts  aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings 
we purchase short term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due to our international 
table of contents subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars  as we regard this as an accounting and not an economic exposure 
as of march   we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts aggregating  all of which related to intercompany debt 
the fair value of the forward contracts and the related gains and losses were not material as of and for the year ended march
