item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of emc insurance group inc and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
company overview emc insurance group inc  a percent owned subsidiary of employers mutual casualty company employers mutual  is an insurance holding company with operations in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance 
property and casualty insurance is the most significant segment  representing percent of consolidated premiums earned in for purposes of this discussion  the term company is used interchangeably to describe emc insurance group inc parent company only and emc insurance group inc 
and its subsidiaries 
employers mutual and all of its subsidiaries including the company and an affiliate are referred to as the emc insurance companies 
the company s four property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and two subsidiaries and an affiliate of employers mutual are parties to reinsurance pooling agreements with employers mutual collectively the pooling agreement 
under the terms of the pooling agreement  each company cedes to employers mutual all of its insurance business  with the exception of any voluntary reinsurance business assumed from nonaffiliated insurance companies  and assumes from employers mutual an amount equal to its participation in the pool 
all premiums  losses  settlement expenses  and other underwriting and administrative expenses  excluding the voluntary reinsurance business assumed by employers mutual from nonaffiliated insurance companies  are prorated among the parties on the basis of participation in the pool 
employers mutual negotiates reinsurance agreements that provide protection to the pool and each of its participants  including protection against losses arising from catastrophic events 
operations of the pool give rise to inter company balances with employers mutual  which are settled on a quarterly basis 
the investment and income tax activities of the pool participants are not subject to the pooling agreement 
the pooling agreement also provides that employers mutual will make up any shortfall or difference resulting from an error in its systems and or computation processes that would otherwise result in the required restatement of the pool participants financial statements 
the purpose of the pooling agreement is to spread the risk of an exposure insured by any of the pool participants among all the companies 
the pooling agreement produces a more uniform and stable underwriting result from year to year for all companies in the pool than might be experienced individually 
in addition  each company benefits from the capacity of the entire pool  rather than being limited to policy exposures of a size commensurate with its own assets  and from the wide range of policy forms  lines of insurance written  rate fillings and commission plans offered by each of the companies 
effective january   the company s aggregate participation in the pooling agreement increased from percent to percent 
in connection with this change in the pooling agreement  the company s liabilities increased  invested assets increased  and other assets increased  the company reimbursed employers mutual  for expenses that were incurred to generate the additional business assumed by the company  but this expense was offset by an increase in deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company also received  in interest income from employers mutual as the actual cash settlement did not occur until february  the company s reinsurance subsidiary assumes a percent quota share portion of employers mutual s assumed reinsurance business  exclusive of certain reinsurance contracts 
this includes all premiums and related losses  settlement expenses  and other underwriting and administrative expenses of this business  subject to a maximum loss of  per event 
the reinsurance subsidiary does not directly reinsure any of the insurance business written by employers mutual or the other pool participants  however  the reinsurance subsidiary assumes reinsurance business from the mutual reinsurance bureau mrb pool and this pool provides a small amount of reinsurance protection to the participants of the pooling agreement 
as a result  the reinsurance subsidiary s assumed exposures include a small portion of the direct business produced by the participants in the pooling agreement  after ceded reinsurance protections purchased by the mrb pool are applied 
in addition  the reinsurance subsidiary does not reinsure any involuntary facility or pool business that employers mutual assumes pursuant to state law 
operations of the quota share agreement give rise to inter company balances with employers mutual  which are settled on a quarterly basis 
the investment and income tax activities of the reinsurance subsidiary are not subject to the quota share agreement 
the reinsurance subsidiary pays an annual override commission to employers mutual in connection with the  cap on losses assumed per event 
the override commission rate is charged at percent of written premiums 
the reinsurance subsidiary also pays for percent of the outside reinsurance protection employers mutual purchases to protect itself from catastrophic losses on the assumed reinsurance business it retains in excess of the  cap per event  excluding reinstatement premiums 
this cost is recorded as a reduction to the premiums received by the reinsurance subsidiary 
under the terms of the quota share agreement  the reinsurance subsidiary receives reinstatement premium income that is collected by employers mutual from the ceding companies  but does not pay reinstatement premium expense for the reinsurance protection carried by employers mutual 
this produces unusual underwriting results for the reinsurance subsidiary when a large event occurs because the reinstatement premium income may approximate  or exceed  the  of assumed losses per event 
changes for effective january   the terms of the quota share agreement between employers mutual and the reinsurance subsidiary were revised 
the majority of the changes were prompted by the significant amount of hurricane losses retained by employers mutual during the severe hurricane season  however  other changes were made to simplify and clarify the terms and conditions of the quota share agreement 
the revised terms of the quota share agreement for are as follows the reinsurance subsidiary s maximum retention  or cap  on losses assumed per event increased from  to  the cost of the  cap on losses assumed per event will be treated as a reduction to written premiums rather than commission expense  the reinsurance subsidiary will no longer directly pay for the outside reinsurance protection that employers mutual purchases to protect itself from catastrophic losses on the assumed reinsurance business it retains in excess of the cap  and will instead pay a higher premium rate previously accounted for as commission  and the reinsurance subsidiary will assume all foreign currency exchange risk benefit associated with contracts incepting on january  and thereafter that are subject to the quota share agreement 
for  the premium rate paid by the reinsurance subsidiary to employers mutual will be percent of written premiums 
the corresponding rate for was approximately percent percent override commission rate plus approximately percent for the cost of the outside reinsurance protection 
based on historical data  the foreign currency exchange gains losses that will be assumed by the reinsurance subsidiary beginning in are not expected to be material 
industry overview an insurance company s underwriting results reflect the profitability of its insurance operations  excluding investment income 
underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and expenses incurred from premiums earned 
an underwriting profit indicates that a sufficient amount of premium income was received to cover the risks insured 
an underwriting loss indicates that premium income was not adequate 
the combined ratio is a measure utilized by insurance companies to gauge underwriting profitability and is calculated by dividing losses and expenses incurred by premiums earned 
a number less than generally indicates an underwriting gain  a number greater than generally indicates an underwriting loss 
insurance companies collect cash in the form of insurance premiums and pay out cash in the form of loss and settlement expense payments 
additional cash outflows occur through the payment of acquisition and underwriting costs such as commissions  premium taxes  salaries and general overhead 
during the loss settlement period  which varies by line of business and by the circumstances surrounding each claim and may cover several years  insurance companies invest the cash premiums and earn interest and dividend income 
this investment income supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings 
the weakening economy during the period through prompted the federal reserve bank to reduce interest rates several times  to the point of historic lows 
as a result  called and matured fixed maturity securities have been reissued at much lower interest rates  which has had a negative impact on the insurance industry s investment income 
although interest rates trended upward in and again in the fourth quarter of  they are still significantly below historic levels 
insurance pricing has historically been cyclical in nature 
periods of excess capital and increased competition encourage price cutting and liberal underwriting practices referred to as a soft market as insurance companies compete for market share  while attempting to cover the inevitable underwriting losses from these actions with investment income 
a prolonged soft market generally leads to a reduction in the adequacy of capital in the insurance industry 
to cure this condition  underwriting practices are tightened  premium pricing rises and competition subsides in the interest of strengthening the balance sheet referred to as a hard market 
during the late s  the insurance industry had hit the depths of an extremely long soft market 
high interest rates and a strong stock market allowed insurers to cover ever growing underwriting losses with investment income 
as the year approached  declining interest rates and a weakening stock market prompted the insurance industry to begin a movement toward increased pricing 
this movement was dramatically accelerated by the terrorist attacks of september   pushing the industry toward a hard market 
the ensuing plunge in the stock market  a further decline in interest rates  high profile bankruptcies and rising concerns about reserve deficiencies lead the insurance industry to implement large premium rate increases in an effort to improve capitalization 
this hard market continued through  but began to level off somewhat during as premium rate increases slowed  or even flattened  in most lines of business 
premium rates were fairly stable during  but moderated slightly in certain lines of business and select territories due to an increase in price competition 
premium rates continued to decline moderately in most areas of the country during  however  there were indications of moderate to significant rate increases in the gulf states and other hurricane exposed areas due to the severe hurricane season 
market conditions are expected to remain competitive in as insurance companies continue to compete for good business 
a substantial determinant of an insurance company s underwriting results is its loss and settlement expense reserving 
insurance companies must estimate the amount of losses and settlement expenses that will ultimately be paid to settle claims that have occurred to date loss and settlement expense reserves 
this estimation process is inherently subjective with the possibility of widely varying results  particularly for certain highly volatile types of claims asbestos  environmental and various casualty exposures  such as products liability  where the loss amount and the parties responsible are difficult to determine 
during a soft market  inadequate premium rates put pressure on insurance companies to under estimate their loss and settlement expense reserves in order to show a profit 
correspondingly  inadequate reserves play an integral part in bringing about a hard market  because increased profitability from higher premium rate levels can be used to strengthen an insurance company s loss and settlement expense reserves 
despite large reserve strengthening actions that have taken place in the insurance industry in recent years  there continues to be concern about the magnitude of potential reserve deficiencies  particularly for asbestos and environmental exposures 
accounting for finite reinsurance transactions became a topic of increased concern for the insurance industry during  forcing several companies to restate their financial results after performing a detailed review of these transactions 
at issue in these transactions is whether the reinsurance contract contains a transfer of risk 
to be considered a qualified reinsurance arrangement  the contract must contain a transfer of both underwriting risk possibility of loss from adverse events occurring outside the control of the parties to the contract and timing risk timely reimbursement of losses by the reinsurer to the cedant with no schedule of loss payments  and there must be a reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
finite reinsurance is a term given to reinsurance transactions that do not transfer one or both elements of underwriting risk or timing risk  or the possibility that the reinsurer could realize a significant loss is not present 
finite reinsurance transactions are not accounted for as reinsurance  but instead are given deposit accounting treatment  which can produce significantly different results 
management believes that all of its reinsurance contracts  both assumed and ceded  contain transfer of risk and thus are accounted for as reinsurance  and does not intend to enter into any finite reinsurance transactions in the future 
during  in response to increased scrutiny of finite reinsurance transactions  the national association of insurance commissioners naic quickly adopted amendments to its annual statement instructions to include interrogatories designed to capture more information about reinsurance  and in particular finite reinsurance 
in addition  ceos and cfos must attest  under penalty of perjury  that  as respects ceded reinsurance transactions  the company a has not entered into any side agreements affecting risk transfer  b has documents evidencing the economic purpose of certain transactions  and a risk transfer analysis of those transactions  c has complied with statement of statutory accounting principle ssap property and casualty reinsurance  and d has adequate internal controls to monitor the use of reinsurance and comply with ssap any exceptions to the certification must be disclosed and explained 
the company s ceo and cfo provided this attestation for indicating no exceptions 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is also currently reviewing the determination and accounting for finite reinsurance transactions 
management continues to monitor both the naic and the fasb for further developments on this issue 
the united states congress is currently studying  or has placed on their agenda  several issues of critical importance to the company and the insurance industry 
these issues include federal regulation on top of  or in place of  current state run regulation  tort and class action reform  the federal government s role in terrorism insurance  and asbestos liability determination and funding 
the company is closely monitoring activities by the united states congress on these issues through its membership in various trade organizations 
management issues and perspectives the company has devoted a substantial amount of time and resources during the last two years to improve the adequacy and consistency of its loss and settlement expense reserves 
case reserve adequacy was highly emphasized throughout and resulted in a significant  but unanticipated  increase in case reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment during the fourth quarter of during  management worked diligently with the branch offices to implement new claim management processes and automated claim system enhancements in order to achieve greater consistency and timeliness in the establishment and monitoring of case reserve estimates 
these initiatives have been successful and management believes that the company s loss and settlement expense reserves have been restored to their historically adequate level 
at december   the company s loss and settlement expense reserves are at the high end of the range of actuarial indications  which is very similar to the company s analysis of its reserve position at year end during  the company experienced favorable development on prior years reserves  which provides confirming evidence of the company s strong reserve position 
in addition  current analysis supports the conclusion that newly reported claims continue to be reserved at high levels of adequacy 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma produced a record amount of losses for the insurance and reinsurance industries in the company had exposure to these hurricanes in both the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment  however  net losses associated with these events were mitigated by a properly structured catastrophe reinsurance program protecting the pool participants  and the  cap on losses assumed per event under the reinsurance subsidiary s quota share agreement with employers mutual 
as previously noted  employers mutual retained a significant amount of hurricane losses under the quota share agreement in  which prompted changes in both the terms and pricing of the agreement for similarly  the catastrophe reinsurance program protecting the pool participants contains some modifications for while the pool participants were able to renew the first layer of the catastrophe reinsurance program percent of occurrence losses in excess of  up to  coverage was reduced for this layer through the addition of an annual aggregate deductible percent of 
in addition  the top cover of the program was increased from  to  and the price of the program increased approximately percent additional cost of approximately  for the company 
there was speculation in late that the severe hurricane season would spark sizable across the board rate increases for all types of reinsurance coverage during the january renewal period  and that these rate increases might halt  or at least slow  the momentum of declining premium rates in the direct insurance market 
reinsurance pricing has increased  in some cases significantly  for business with coastal exposures  but there has not been a large across the board increase in reinsurance rates and coverage is readily available 
reinsurance rates are expected to increase moderately during  but these increases are not expected to be large enough to influence the direct market 
as a result  rate competition is expected to continue in the direct market during and may intensify somewhat in the midwestern states  where the company does most of its business  as insurance companies attempt to reduce their coastal exposures and replace that business with non coastal exposures 
the company s net written premiums increased significantly in due to the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries increased participation in the pooling agreement  however  net written premiums for the pool declined percent in this decline reflects a decrease in new business  an increase in ceded premiums and a decline in the number of rate increases the company was able to implement due to increased competition in the marketplace and the company s current level of rate adequacy 
policy retention has remained at high levels over the last several years  but policy count has declined as a result of increased competition for good business and company initiatives to exit unprofitable business 
management is attempting to reverse this trend through improved product management initiatives and technology improvements that will make it easier for agents to do business with the company 
management has long recognized the importance of adequate capitalization for its insurance subsidiaries and has strived to maintain a strong capital position by investing their assets conservatively and  more importantly  maintaining a consistent level of loss and settlement expense reserve adequacy 
carried reserves are analyzed on a regular basis and adjustments  if necessary  are implemented on a timely basis 
this procedure not only assures a consistent level of reserve adequacy  it also minimizes the impact that any required adjustment will have on current operations 
in addition to an ongoing review of claim files in the normal course of business  the company has for many years required each of its branch offices to perform a complete inventory of its open claim files during the fourth quarter of each year and to review the adequacy of each carried reserve based on current information 
this fourth quarter review process has not historically resulted in a significant increase in carried reserves  however  because of the heightened emphasis placed on case reserve adequacy during  the review performed in the fourth quarter of generated a significant and unanticipated increase in carried reserves and a corresponding increase in settlement expense reserves 
in an effort to minimize the likelihood of this occurring in the future  the branch offices are now required to perform a complete inventory and review of their open claim files semi annually 
the first review is to be completed by the end of june and the second review is to be completed by the end of november each year 
this new procedure  which is designed to help assure that necessary reserve adjustments are implemented on a timely basis  did not result in any significant reserve adjustments in the participants in the emc insurance companies pooling agreement currently carry an a excellent rating from am best company 
management has worked diligently over the last several years to improve profitability through a combination of adequate pricing and focused underwriting practices 
maintaining a consistent level of profitability is a primary goal of management that will assist the company in its quest to achieve an even higher rating from am best company 
catastrophe and storm losses are unpredictable and can vary significantly from year to year 
management uses modeling software to help identify and estimate its potential loss exposure to a variety of events  both natural and manmade 
natural events that are modeled include hurricanes  tornados and windstorms  and earthquakes 
modeling activities for manmade events are primarily directed toward identifying concentrations of risk  such as workers compensation coverage for a business or property that is subject to a terrorist attack or other manmade event 
management purchases reinsurance protection to mitigate the company s loss potential to these types of exposures 
measurement of results the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of us generally accepted accounting principles also known as gaap 
the company also prepares financial statements for each of its insurance subsidiaries based on statutory accounting principles that are filed with insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which they do business 
statutory accounting principles are designed to address the concerns of state regulators and stress the measurement of the insurer s ability to satisfy its obligations to its policyholders and creditors 
management evaluates the company s operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
management measures the company s growth by examining direct premiums written and  perhaps more importantly  premiums written assumed from affiliates 
management generally measures the company s operating results by examining the company s net income  return on equity  and the loss and settlement expense  acquisition expense and combined ratios 
the following provides further explanation of the key measures management uses to evaluate the company s results direct premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of the total policy premiums  net of cancellations  associated with policies underwritten and issued by the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
these direct premiums written are transferred to employers mutual under the terms of the pooling agreement and are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements as premiums written ceded to affiliates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
premiums written assumed from affiliates 
premiums written assumed from affiliates reflects the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries aggregate participation interest in the total direct premiums written by all the participants in the pooling arrangement and the premiums written assumed by the company s reinsurance subsidiary from employers mutual under the quota share agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management uses premiums written assumed from affiliates and non affiliates  which excludes the impact of written premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of the company s insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of the premiums written assumed from affiliates plus premiums written assumed from non affiliates less premiums written ceded to non affiliates 
premiums written ceded to non affiliates is the portion of the company s direct and assumed premiums written that is transferred to reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and based upon the risks they accept 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management uses net premiums written to measure the amount of business retained after cessions to reinsurers 
loss and settlement expense ratio 
the loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and settlement expenses to premiums earned and measures the underwriting profitability of a company s insurance business 
the loss and settlement expense ratio is generally measured on both a gross direct and assumed and net gross less ceded basis 
management uses the gross loss and settlement expense ratio as a measure of the company s overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business it writes and to assess the adequacy of the company s pricing 
the net loss and settlement expense ratio is meaningful in evaluating the company s financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the loss and settlement expense ratios are generally calculated in the same way for gaap and statutory accounting purposes 
acquisition expense ratio 
the acquisition expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of net acquisition and other expenses to premiums earned and measures a company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
for statutory accounting purposes  acquisition and other expenses of an insurance company exclude investment expenses 
there is no such industry definition for determining an acquisition expense ratio for gaap purposes 
as a result  management applies the statutory definition to calculate the company s acquisition expense ratio on a gaap basis 
the net acquisition expense ratio is meaningful in evaluating the company s financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
gaap combined ratio 
the combined ratio expressed as a percentage is the sum of the loss and settlement expense ratio and the acquisition expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
management uses the gaap combined ratio in evaluating the company s overall underwriting profitability and as a measure for comparison of the company s profitability relative to the profitability of its competitors who prepare gaap basis financial statements 
statutory combined ratio 
the statutory combined ratio expressed as a percentage is calculated in the same manner as the gaap combined ratio  but is based on results determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules and regulations 
the statutory trade combined ratio differs from the statutory combined ratio in that the acquisition expense ratio is based on net premiums written rather than net premiums earned 
management uses the statutory trade combined ratio as a measure for comparison of the company s profitability relative to the profitability of its competitors  all of whom must file statutory basis financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered by management to be critically important in the preparation and understanding of the company s financial statements and related disclosures 
the assumptions utilized in the application of these accounting policies are complex and require subjective judgment 
loss and settlement expense reserves processes and assumptions for establishing loss and settlement expense reserves liabilities for losses are based upon case basis estimates of reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
for direct insurance business  the company s ibnr reserves are estimates of liability for accidents that have occurred  but have not yet been reported to the company 
for assumed reinsurance business  ibnr reserves are also used to record anticipated increases in reserves for claims that have previously been reported 
an estimate of the expected expenses to be incurred in the settlement of the claims provided for in the loss reserves is established as the liability for settlement expenses 
property and casualty insurance segment the company s claims department establishes case loss reserves for direct business 
branch claims personnel establish case reserves for individual claims  with mandatory home office claims department review of reserves that exceed a specified threshold 
the company s case loss reserve philosophy is exposure based and implicitly assumes a stable inflationary and legal environment 
when claims department personnel establish loss reserves they take into account various factors that influence the potential exposure  such as the types of injuries being claimed  whether the insured is a target defendant  the jurisdiction in which a potential court case would be litigated and negligence of other parties 
the goal of the claims department is to establish and maintain loss reserves that are sufficient  but not excessive 
most of the ibnr reserves for direct business are established through an actuarial analysis of ibnr claims that have emerged after the end of recent calendar years compared to the corresponding calendar year earned premiums adjusted for changes in rate level adequacy 
the methodology used in estimating these formula ibnr reserves assumes consistency in claims reporting patterns and immaterial changes in loss development patterns due to loss cost trends 
from this analysis  ibnr factors are derived for each line of business and are applied to the latest twelve months of earned premiums to generate the formula ibnr reserves 
ceded reserves are derived by applying the ceded contract terms to the direct reserves 
for excess of loss contracts excluding the catastrophe contract  this is accomplished by applying the ceded contract terms to the case reserves of the ceded claims 
for the catastrophe excess of loss contract  ceded reserves are calculated by applying the contract terms to both the aggregate case reserves on claims stemming from catastrophes and the estimate of ibnr reserves developed for each individual catastrophe 
for quota share contracts  ceded reserves are calculated as the quota share percentage multiplied by both case and ibnr reserves on the direct business 
the methodology used for reserving settlement expenses is based on an analysis of historical ratios of paid expenses to paid losses 
assumptions underlying this methodology include stability in the mix of business  consistent claims processing procedures  immaterial impact of loss cost trends on development patterns  and a consistent philosophy regarding the defense of lawsuits 
based on this actuarial analysis  factors are derived for each line of business  which are applied to loss reserves to generate the settlement expense reserves 
as of december   ibnr loss reserves accounted for  or percent  of the property and casualty insurance segment s total loss and settlement expense reserves  compared to  or percent at december  ibnr reserves are  by nature  less precise than case reserves 
a five percent change in ibnr reserves at december  would equate to a  change in loss reserves  which would represent percent of net income and percent of stockholders equity 
the company s direct ibnr reserves are established by applying factors to the latest twelve months premiums earned 
these factors are developed using a methodology that compares ibnr claims that have emerged after prior year ends to corresponding prior years premiums earned that have been adjusted to the current level of rate adequacy 
included in the rate adequacy adjustment is consideration of current frequency and severity trends compared to the trends underlying prior years calculations 
the selected trends are based on an analysis of industry and company loss data 
this methodology assumes that future emerged ibnr claims relative to ibnr claims that have emerged after prior year ends will reflect the change in frequency and severity trends underlying the rate adequacy adjustments 
if this projected relationship proves to be inaccurate  future ibnr claims may differ substantially from the estimated ibnr reserves 
following is a summary of the carried loss and settlement expense reserves for the property and casualty insurance segment at december  and the reserve amounts at december  reflect the company s percent participation in the pooling agreement  while the reserve amounts at december  reflect the prior percent participation in the pooling agreement 
december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands commercial lines automobile property workers compensation liability bonds total commercial lines personal lines automobile property total personal lines total property and casualty insurance segment december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands commercial lines automobile property workers compensation liability bonds total commercial lines personal lines automobile property total personal lines total property and casualty insurance segment internal actuarial evaluations of overall loss reserve levels are performed quarterly for all direct lines of business 
there is a certain amount of random variation in loss development patterns  which results in some uncertainty regarding projected ultimate losses  particularly for longer tail lines such as workers compensation  other liability and commercial auto liability 
therefore  the reasonability of the actuarial projections is regularly monitored through an examination of loss ratio and claims severity trends implied by these projections 
historically  individual case reserves established by the claims department have been adequate 
however  actuarial analyses performed during indicated that overall case reserves appeared to be somewhat inadequate 
this apparent inadequacy was driven by the workers compensation line of business  where adverse development more than offset the favorable development experienced on all other lines of business combined 
further analysis revealed that recent adverse development experienced in the workers compensation line of business was arising from both the indemnity and medical portion of the claims 
the underlying data indicated that the aggregate liability associated with time away from work was somewhat underestimated and that permanent injury awards were somewhat underestimated and or not anticipated when the reserves were established 
in response to these findings  the company established a bulk case reserve for the workers compensation line of business to supplement the individual case reserves 
beginning in  an actuarial evaluation of case reserve adequacy was performed each quarter  which resulted in additional increases in the bulk case reserve during to address the underlying cause of the indicated deficiency in case reserves  the home office claims department in early instructed each of the branch offices to review and carefully reevaluate all claim reserves for adequacy 
as a result of these reviews  case reserves were strengthened significantly in both the second and third quarters of and the third quarter actuarial review indicated that case reserves  as well as total loss and settlement expense reserves  were adequate 
however  during the required fourth quarter inventory and review process  the branch offices further strengthened their case reserves  generating a significant amount of adverse development on prior year s reserves 
with this additional strengthening  carried loss and settlement expense reserves were toward the high end of the range of actuarial reserve indications at december  during  the level of case reserve adequacy in the workers compensation line of business was carefully monitored 
available evidence suggests that claims adjusters continued to establish case reserves at appropriate levels  and that the indicated adequacy of individual case reserves at december  was maintained throughout consequently  a portion of the workers compensation bulk case reserve was reallocated to various components of the loss and settlement expense reserve for the other liability line of business ibnr  asbestos and settlement expense and the remaining amount was eliminated at the end of at year end  carried loss and settlement expense reserves were once again toward the high end of the range of actuarial indications 
one of the variables impacting the estimation of ibnr reserves is the assumption that the vast majority of future construction defect losses will continue to occur in those states in which most construction defect claims have historically arisen 
since the vast majority of these losses have been confined to a relatively small number of states  which is consistent with industry experience  there is no provision in the ibnr reserve for a significant spread of construction defect claims to other states 
it is also assumed that various underwriting initiatives implemented in recent years will gradually mitigate the amount of construction defect losses experienced 
these initiatives include exclusionary endorsements  increased care regarding additional insured endorsements  a general reduction in the amount of contractor business written relative to the total commercial lines book of business and underwriting restrictions on the writing of residential contractors 
the estimation of the company s ibnr reserves also does not contemplate substantial losses from potential mass torts such as methyl tertiary butyl ether a gasoline additive that reduces emissions  but causes pollution  tobacco  silicosis  cell phones and lead 
further  consistent with general industry practice  the ibnr reserve for all liability lines does not provide for any significant retroactive expansion of coverage through judicial interpretation 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  ultimate paid amounts on emerged ibnr claims may differ substantially from the carried ibnr reserves 
as previously noted  the estimation of settlement expense reserves assumes a consistent claims department philosophy regarding the defense of lawsuits 
if the company should in the future take a more aggressive defense posture  defense costs would increase and it is likely that carried settlement expense reserves would be deficient 
however  such a change in philosophy could be expected to reduce losses  generating some offsetting redundancy in the loss reserves 
an important assumption underlying aggregate reserve estimation methods is that the claims inflation trends implicitly built into the loss and settlement expense development patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  the actuarial department derived expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary trend of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
this additional unexpected claims inflation trend could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  social inflation and  especially for the workers compensation line of business  the introduction of new medical technologies and procedures  changes in the utilization of procedures and changes in life expectancy 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional unexpected one percent increase in the inflationary trend would have on the company s results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims is shown below 
after tax impact on line of business earnings in thousands personal auto liability commercial auto liability auto physical damage workers compensation other liability property homeowners the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposure to environmental and asbestos claims arising primarily from the other liability line of business 
this exposure is closely monitored by management  and the company has established ibnr reserves to cover estimated ultimate losses 
currently  asbestos reserves are based on the results of an independent consultant s ground up study of the company s asbestos exposures that was completed in early the company elected to strengthen asbestos reserves moderately in in consideration of the implied three year survival ratio ratio of loss reserves to the three year average of loss payments 
environmental reserves are also established with consideration of the implied three year survival ratio 
estimation of ultimate liabilities for these exposures is unusually difficult due to unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  the definition of an occurrence  the determination of ultimate damages and the allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties 
therefore  any estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty  and ultimate payments for losses and settlement expenses for these exposures may differ significantly from the carried reserves 
reinsurance segment the reinsurance book of business is comprised of two major components 
the first is home office reinsurance assumed department horad  which is the reinsurance business that is underwritten by employers mutual 
the second is the mrb pool  which is a voluntary reinsurance pool in which employers mutual participates with other unaffiliated insurers 
the primary actuarial methods used to project ultimate policy year losses on the assumed reinsurance business are paid development  incurred development and bornhuetter ferguson  a recognized actuarial methodology 
the assumptions underlying the various projection methods include stability in the mix of business  consistent claims processing procedures  immaterial impact of loss cost trends on development patterns  consistent case reserving practices and appropriate bornhuetter ferguson expected loss ratio selections 
for the horad component  employers mutual records the case and ibnr reserves reported by the ceding companies 
since many ceding companies in the horad book of business do not report ibnr reserves  employers mutual establishes a bulk ibnr reserve  which is based on an actuarial reserve analysis  to cover the lag in reporting 
for mrb  employers mutual records the case and ibnr reserves reported to it by the management of the pool  along with a relatively small ibnr reserve to cover a one month reporting lag 
to verify the adequacy of the reported reserves  an actuarial evaluation of mrb s reserves is performed at each year end 
settlement expense reserves for both the horad and mrb books of business are developed through the application of factors to carried loss reserves 
the factors are derived from an analysis of paid settlement expenses to paid losses 
the assumptions described for the property and casualty insurance segment also apply to the reinsurance segment settlement expense reserving process 
at december   the carried reserves for horad and mrb combined were in the upper quarter of the range of actuarial reserve indications 
this selection reflects the fact that there are inherent uncertainties involved in establishing reserves for assumed reinsurance business 
such uncertainties include the fact that a reinsurance company generally has less knowledge than the ceding company about the underlying book of business and the ceding company s reserving practices 
because of these uncertainties  there is a risk that the reinsurance segment s reserves for losses and settlement expenses could prove to be inadequate  with a consequent adverse impact on the company s future earnings and stockholders equity 
at december   there was no backlog in the processing of assumed reinsurance information 
approximately  or percent of the reinsurance segment s carried reserves were reported by the ceding companies 
employers mutual receives loss reserve and paid loss data from the ceding companies on individual excess of loss business 
if a claim involves a single or small group of claimants  a summary of the loss and claim outlook is normally provided 
summarized data is provided for catastrophe claims and pro rata business  which is subject to closer review if inconsistencies are suspected 
unearned premiums are generally reported on pro rata accounts  but are usually calculated by employers mutual on excess of loss business 
carried reserves established in addition to those reported by the ceding companies totaled approximately  at december  since many ceding companies in the horad book of business do not report ibnr reserves  employers mutual establishes a bulk ibnr reserve to cover the lag in reporting 
for the few ceding companies that do report ibnr reserves  employers mutual carries them as reported 
these reported ibnr reserves are subtracted from the total ibnr reserve calculated by employers mutual s actuaries  with the difference carried as bulk ibnr reserves 
except for a small ibnr reserve established to cover a one month lag in reporting  the mrb ibnr reserve is established by the management of mrb 
employers mutual rarely records additional case reserves 
assumed reinsurance losses tend to be reported later than direct losses 
this lag is reflected in loss projection factors for assumed reinsurance that tend to be higher than for direct business 
the result is that assumed reinsurance ibnr reserves as a percentage of total reserves tend to be higher than for direct reserves 
ibnr reserves totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  and for both years accounted for approximately percent of the reinsurance segment s total loss reserves 
ibnr reserves are  by nature  less precise than case reserves 
a five percent change in ibnr reserves at december  would equate to a  change in loss reserves  which would represent percent of net income and percent of stockholders equity 
following is a summary of the carried loss and settlement expense reserves for the reinsurance segment at december  and december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands pro rata reinsurance property and casualty property crop casualty marine aviation total pro rata reinsurance excess of loss reinsurance property casualty surety total excess of loss reinsurance total reinsurance segment december  settlement line of business case ibnr expense total in thousands pro rata reinsurance property and casualty property crop casualty marine aviation total pro rata reinsurance excess of loss reinsurance property casualty surety total excess of loss reinsurance total reinsurance segment to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information received from the ceding companies  the actuarial department carefully reviews the latest five horad policy years on a quarterly basis  and all policy years on an annual basis 
any significant departures from historical reporting patterns are brought to the attention of the reinsurance department staff who contact the ceding company or broker for clarification 
employers mutual s actuarial department annually reviews the mrb reserves for reasonableness 
these analyses use a variety of actuarial techniques  which are applied at a line of business level 
mrb staff supplies the reserve analysis data  which is verified for accuracy by employers mutual s actuaries 
this review process is replicated by certain other mrb member companies  using actuarial techniques they deem appropriate 
based on these reviews  employers mutual and the other mrb member companies have consistently found the mrb reserves to be appropriate 
for the horad book of business  paid and incurred loss development patterns for relatively short tail lines of business property and marine are based on data reported by the ceding companies 
employers mutual has determined that there is sufficient volume and stability in the reported losses to base projections of ultimate losses on these patterns 
for longer tail lines of business casualty  industry incurred development patterns are referenced due to the instability of development patterns based on reported historical losses 
for long tail lines of business  unreliable estimates of unreported losses can result from the application of loss projection factors to reported losses 
to some extent  this is also true for short tail lines of business in the early stages of a policy year s development 
therefore  in addition to loss based projections  employers mutual generates estimates of unreported losses based on earned premiums 
the latter estimates are sometimes more stable and reliable than projections based on losses 
disputes with ceding companies do not occur often 
employers mutual performs claims audits and reviews claim reports for accuracy  completeness and adequate reserving 
most reinsurance contracts contain arbitration clauses to resolve disputes  but such disputes are generally resolved without arbitration due to the long term and ongoing relationships that exist with those companies 
there were no matters in dispute at december  toxic tort primarily asbestos  environmental and other uncertain exposures toxic tort claims include those claims where the claimant seeks compensation for harm allegedly caused by exposure to a toxic substance or substance that increases the risk of contracting a serious disease  such as cancer 
typically the injury is caused by latent effects of direct or indirect exposure to a substance or combination of substances through absorption  contact  ingestion  inhalation  implantation or injection 
examples of toxic tort claims include injuries arising out of exposure to asbestos  silica  mold  drugs  carbon monoxide  chemicals or lead 
since  the company has included an asbestos exclusion in liability policies issued for most lines of business 
the exclusion prohibits liability coverage for bodily injury  personal injury or property damage including any associated clean up obligations arising out of the installation  existence  removal or disposal of asbestos or any substance containing asbestos fibers 
therefore  the company s present asbestos exposures are primarily limited to commercial policies issued prior to at present  the company is defending approximately asbestos bodily injury lawsuits  some of which involve multiple plaintiffs 
most of these defenses are subject to express reservation of rights based upon the lack of an injury within the company s policy periods  because many asbestos lawsuits do not specifically allege dates of asbestos exposure or dates of injury 
the company s policyholders that have been named as defendants in these asbestos lawsuits are peripheral defendants who have had little or no exposure and are routinely dismissed from asbestos litigation with nominal or no payment at all ie  small contractors  insulators  electrical welding supply  furnace manufacturers  gasket  and building supply companies 
during  as a direct result of proposed federal legislation in the areas of asbestos and class action reform  the company was presented with several hundred additional lawsuits filed against three former policyholders representing approximately  claims related to exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products 
these claims are based upon nonspecific asbestos exposure and nonspecific injuries 
as a result  management did not establish a significant amount of loss reserves associated with these claims 
the vast majority of the  claims are multi plaintiff suits filed in mississippi 
one lawsuit lists multiple named plaintiffs of approximately  individuals 
while the expense of handling these lawsuits is higher than what the company has averaged in the past  it is not proportional based upon the number of plaintiffs  and is mitigated to some extent through cost sharing agreements reached with other insurance companies 
the company believes its settlement expense reserve adequately accounts for these additional expenses 
the company has denied coverage to one of the former policyholders  representing approximately  claims  because of express asbestos exclusion language contained in the policy 
minimal expense payments have been made to date on the lawsuits related to the other two former policyholders and no payments have been made for either defense or indemnity 
four former policyholders and one current policyholder dominate the company s asbestos claims 
to date  actual losses paid have been minimal due to the plaintiffs failure to identify an asbestos containing product to which they were exposed that is associated with the company s policyholders 
defense costs  on the other hand  have typically increased due to the increased number of parties involved in the litigation and the length of time required to obtain a favorable judgment 
whenever possible  the company has participated in cost sharing agreements with other insurance companies to reduce overall asbestos claim expenses 
proposed federal asbestos legislation initially introduced in has thus far not been successful  yet plaintiffs attorneys have already altered their pleadings across the country to anticipate the enactment of federal legislation 
specifically  asbestos plaintiffs attorneys are pleading silica and pneumoconiosis dust exposure for new clients  as well as former asbestos plaintiffs 
the company is defending approximately such claims in texas and mississippi jurisdictions  some of which involve multiple plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs allege employment exposure to airborne respirable silica dust  causing serious and permanent lung injuries  ie  silicosis 
silicosis injuries are identified in the upper lobes of the lungs  while asbestos injuries are localized in the lower lobes 
the plaintiffs in the silicosis lawsuits are sandblasters  gravel and concrete workers  ceramic workers and road construction workers 
all of these lawsuits are subject to express reservation of rights based upon the lack of an injury within the company s policy periods because many silica lawsuits  like asbestos lawsuits  do not specifically allege dates of exposure or dates of injury 
the company s policyholders a refractory product manufacturer  small local concrete and gravel companies and a concrete cutting machine manufacturer that have been named as defendants in these silica lawsuits have had little or no exposure and are routinely dismissed from silica litigation with nominal  or no  payment 
while the expense of handling these lawsuits is high  it is not proportional based upon the number of plaintiffs  and is mitigated to some extent through cost sharing agreements reached with other insurance companies 
in texas  where the company has a considerable amount of asbestos and silica claims  the texas senate passed a measure that proposes to reduce the number of claims while protecting the rights of the afflicted 
senate bill addresses a number of problems associated with asbestos and silica litigation 
the bill requires that persons first be diagnosed with asbestos or silica related impairments 
it also stipulates that bundling or grouping various asbestos or silica related claims into a single trial will not be permitted  unless agreed to by the parties 
furthermore  these cases are being transferred to a state multi district litigation court mdl for screening 
in  the company developed  filed and attached pneumoconiosis dust exclusions in the majority of jurisdictions where such action was warranted 
mixed dust is defined as dust  or a mixture of dusts  composed of one or more of the following asbestos  silica  fiberglass  iron  tin  coal  cement  cadminium  carbon  mica  cobalt  barium  tungsten  kaolin  graphite  clay  ceramic  talc  vitallium  beryllium  zinc  cotton  hemp  flax or grain 
this exclusion precludes liability coverage for any injury  damage  expense  cost  loss  liability  defense or legal obligation arising out of  resulting from or in any way related to  in whole or in part mixed dust pneumoconiosis  pleural plaques  pleural effusion  mesothelioma  lung cancer  emphysema  bronchitis  tuberculosis or pleural thickening  or other pneumoconiosis related ailments such as arthritis  cancer other than lung  lupus  heart  kidney or gallbladder disease 
it is anticipated that this mixed dust exclusion will further limit the company s exposure in silica claims  and may be broad enough to limit exposure in other dust claims 
the company s environmental claims are defined as claims for bodily injury  personal injury  property damage  loss of use of property  diminution of property value  etc  allegedly due to contamination of air  and or contamination of surface soil or surface water  and or contamination of ground water  aquifers  wells  etc  or any all claims for remediation or clean up of hazardous waste sites by the united states environmental protection agency  or similar state and local environmental or government agencies  usually presented in conjunction with federal or local clean up statutes ie  cercla  rcra  ie examples include  but are not limited to chemical waste  hazardous waste treatment  storage and or disposal facilities  industrial waste disposal facilities  landfills  superfund sites  toxic waste spills  and underground storage tanks 
widespread use of pollution exclusions since in virtually all lines of business  except personal lines  has resulted in limited exposure to environmental claims 
absolute pollution exclusions have been used since the s 
the company s exposure to environmental claims is therefore limited primarily to accident years preceding the s 
the pre s exposures include municipality exposures for closed landfills  small commercial businesses involved with disposing waste at landfills  leaking underground storage tanks and contamination from dry cleaning operations 
in  the company was presented with eight contamination claims filed against four of its petroleum marketers in iowa and indiana 
these claims arise out of alleged contamination of municipal public water systems by the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe 
all mtbe lawsuits initiated in california  connecticut  florida  indiana  iowa  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey and new york were moved to their respective federal courts and were then transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york  where they were consolidated under the caption  in re methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe products liability litigation 
the company is defending these claims under commercial auto policies which afford broadened pollution liability coverage for overfills 
these claims are subject to express reservations of rights based upon the lack of property damage within the policy periods  because these lawsuits do not specifically allege dates of property damage or contamination or any contamination that is the result of an overfill 
the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims through assumed reinsurance is very limited due to the fact that the company s reinsurance subsidiary entered into the reinsurance marketplace in the early s after much attention had already been brought to these issues 
the company took action to commute one reinsurance contract during the first quarter of that had some asbestos and environmental reserves associated with it 
at december   the company carried asbestos and environmental reserves for direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business totaling  which represents percent of total loss and settlement expense reserves 
the asbestos and environmental reserves include  of case reserves   of ibnr reserves and  of bulk settlement expense reserves 
the company s non asbestos direct product liability claims are considered to be highly uncertain exposures due to the many uncertainties inherent in determining the loss  and the significant periods of time that can elapse between the occurrence of the loss and the ultimate settlement of the claim 
the majority of the company s product liability claims arise from small to medium sized manufacturers  contractors  petroleum distributors  and mobile home and auto dealerships 
no specific claim trends are evident from the company s manufacturer policies  as the claims activity on these policies is generally isolated and can be severe 
specific product coverage is provided to the company s mobile home and auto dealership policyholders  and the claims from these policies tend to be relatively small 
certain construction defect claims are reported under product liability coverage 
during  of these claims were reported to the company 
the company s assumed casualty excess reinsurance is also considered to be a highly uncertain exposure due to the significant periods of time that can elapse during the settlement of the underlying claims and the fact that a reinsurance company generally has less knowledge than the ceding company about the underlying book of business and the ceding company s reserving practices 
the company attempts to account for this uncertainty by establishing bulk ibnr reserves  using conservative assumed treaty limits and  to a much lesser extent  booking of individual treaty ibnr if reported by the ceding company or establishing additional case reserves if the reported case reserves appear inadequate on an individual claim 
while the company s reinsurance subsidiary is predominantly a property reinsurer  it does write casualty excess business oriented mainly towards shorter tail casualty lines of coverage 
the company avoids reinsuring large company working layer casualty risks  and does not write risks with heavy product liability exposures  risks with obvious latent injury manifestation  medical malpractice  and for profit directors and officers coverage 
a small amount of casualty excess business on large companies is written  but generally on a clash basis only layers above the limits written for any individual policyholder 
the company has exposure to construction defect claims arising from general liability policies issued to contractors 
most of the company s construction defect claims are concentrated in a limited number of states  and the company has taken steps to mitigate this exposure 
construction defect is a highly uncertain exposure due to such issues as whether coverage exists  definition of an occurrence  determination of ultimate damages  and allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties 
the company has recently implemented additional coding to identify and monitor construction defect claims 
newly reported construction defect claims numbered   and in   and  respectively  and produced incurred losses and paid settlement expenses of approximately   and  in each respective period 
incurred losses and paid settlement expenses on all construction defect claims totaled approximately  in at year end  the company carried case reserves of approximately  on open construction defect claims

however  at each year end an actuarially determined range of estimates is developed for the major components of the loss and settlement expense reserves 
all reserves are reviewed  except for the involuntary workers compensation pools  for which reliance is placed on a reserve opinion received from the national council on compensation insurance certifying the reasonableness of those reserves 
shown below are the actuarially determined ranges of reserve estimates as of december   along with the net carried reserves 
the last two columns display the estimated after tax impact on earnings if the reserves were moved to the high endpoint and the low endpoint of the ranges 
range of reserve estimates after tax impact on earnings reserves reserves in thousands high low carried at high at low property and casualty insurance segment reinsurance segment changes in loss and settlement expense reserve estimates of prior periods loss and settlement expense reserves are estimates at a given time of what an insurer expects to pay on incurred losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
during the loss settlement period  which may be many years  additional facts regarding individual claims become known  and accordingly  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim 
such changes in reserves for losses and settlement expenses are reflected in operating results in the year such changes are recorded 
during the year ended december   the company experienced favorable development in the provision for insured events of prior years  as compared to adverse development in this measure in each of the preceding two years 
the majority of the adverse development of the preceding two years came from the property and casualty insurance segment  primarily in the workers compensation and other liability lines of business 
following are the significant issues and trends that were identified as contributors to the development during the preceding two year period 
workers compensation claim severity increased significantly  with the projected ultimate average claim amount increasing approximately percent over the five year period ending in an increase of this magnitude made the establishment of adequate case reserves challenging 
a review of claim data indicated that claims adjusters had underestimated medical costs and the length of time injured workers are away from work 
in addition  partial disability benefits had been underestimated or unanticipated 
large increases in drug costs and the availability and utilization of new and costly medical procedures contributed to rapidly escalating medical costs 
construction defect claims arising from general liability policies issued to contractors contributed to adverse reserve development 
states with significant construction defect losses included alabama  arizona  california  colorado  nevada and texas 
large umbrella claims contributed to the adverse development experienced in the other liability line of business 
a pattern of increasing umbrella claims severity is believed to be generally consistent with industry umbrella severity trends 
also contributing to overall umbrella reserve development was an increase in claims arising from underlying general liability policies 
legal expenses for the other liability line of business increased rapidly over the three years ending in  with defense costs increasing at an average rate of approximately percent per year 
this increase in legal expenses occurred despite a reduction in the number of new lawsuits 
in response to an indicated deficiency in case reserves at december   the home office claims department in early instructed each of the branch offices to review and carefully reevaluate all claim reserves for adequacy 
as a result of these reviews  case reserves were strengthened in both the second and third quarters of however  during the required fourth quarter inventory and review process  the branch offices further strengthened their case reserves  generating a significant amount of adverse development on prior years reserves 
as a result of these reserving actions  carried loss and settlement expense reserves were toward the high end of the range of actuarial indications at december  this level of reserve adequacy was supported by the favorable development experienced in  which occurred in virtually all lines of business 
for a detailed discussion of the factors influencing the development of prior years reserves  see the discussion entitled loss and settlement expense reserves under the narrative description of business heading in the business section under item i of this form k 
deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization acquisition costs consisting of commissions  premiums taxes and other underwriting expenses that vary with and are directly related to the production of business are deferred and amortized as premium revenue is recognized 
this adjustment is necessary because statutory accounting principles require that expenses incurred in the production of insurance business be expensed immediately  while premium revenue is recognized ratably over the terms of the underlying insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization are calculated separately for the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to the estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
deferred policy acquisition costs were not subject to limitation at december   and management does not anticipate future limitations to be likely due to the improved premium rate environment in both the insurance and reinsurance marketplaces 
deferred income taxes the realization of the deferred income tax asset is based upon projections that indicate that a sufficient amount of future taxable income will be earned to utilize the tax deductions that will reverse in the future 
these projections are based on the company s history of producing significant amounts of taxable income  the improved premium rate environment for both the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment and loss and expense control initiatives that have been implemented in recent years 
in addition  management has formulated tax planning strategies that could be implemented to generate taxable income if needed 
should the projected taxable income and tax planning strategies not provide sufficient taxable income to recover the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance would be required 
benefit plans employers mutual sponsors two pension plans  including a defined benefit retirement plan pension and a supplemental retirement plan  and two postretirement benefit plans that provide retiree healthcare and life insurance coverage 
although the company has no employees of its own  it is responsible for its share of the expenses and related prepaid assets and liabilities of these plans under the terms of the pooling agreement and the cost allocation methodologies applicable to subsidiaries that do not participate in the pooling agreement 
the pension and postretirement benefit costs  as well as the prepaid assets and liabilities of these plans  are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases pension plans only  and health care cost trend rates healthcare postretirement plan only 
the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are updated annually 
material changes in the pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes in asset levels and changes in legislation or regulations 
the discount rate selected is based on an analysis using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds that produce cash flows matching the plans expected benefit payments 
this analysis is compared for reasonableness to interest rates of applicable published indices 
the discount rates used in the pension and postretirement benefit valuations were   and percent at december   and  respectively 
the percentage point decrease in the discount rate in increased the pension and postretirement benefit net periodic cost for by approximately  the company s share of this additional expense for is approximately  the expected long term rates of return on the plans assets are developed considering actual historical results  current and expected market conditions  the mix of plan assets and investment strategy 
the expected long term rates of return on the plans assets produced by this analysis and used for the pension valuations were   and percent at december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets used for the postretirement benefit valuations was percent for each of the three years ended december   and the actual rates of return on assets were approximately percent for the pension plans and percent for the postretirement benefit plans 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is subject to change with the general movement of the economy  but is generally less volatile than the discount rate assumption 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rates of return on the plans assets in would have increased the pension and postretirement benefit costs for by  the company s share of this additional expense would have been approximately  for detailed information regarding the plans asset allocations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the health care cost trend rates represent the assumption for the change in the cost of health care benefits due to factors outside of the plan 
these factors include health care inflation  change in health care utilization delivery patterns  technological advances and the status of the health of the plan participants 
the health care cost trend rates assumption is established based on published information and general economic conditions 
the health care cost trend rate assumption for was percent  and is assumed to decrease gradually to percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
the health care cost trend rate assumption for was percent  and was assumed to decrease gradually to percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
this change in assumption increased the postretirement benefit costs for by approximately  the company s share of this additional expense for is approximately in accordance with gaap  actuarial gains losses that result from actual experience that differs from that assumed  or a change in actuarial assumptions  is accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized to expense over future periods 
as of december   the pension and postretirement benefit plans had accumulated actuarial losses resulting from both experience and assumption changes that will be amortized to expense beginning in the company s share of this expense will amount to  and  for the pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
results of operations segment information and consolidated net income for the three years ended december  are as follows in thousands property and casualty insurance premiums earned losses and settlement expenses acquisition and other expenses underwriting gain loss loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year decrease increase in provision for insured events of prior years total losses and settlement expenses catastrophe and storm losses in thousands reinsurance premiums earned losses and settlement expenses acquisition and other expenses underwriting gain loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total losses and settlement expenses catastrophe and storm losses in thousands consolidated revenues premiums earned net investment income realized investment gains other income losses and expenses losses and settlement expenses acquisition and other expenses interest expense other expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net income per share loss and settlement expense ratio acquisition expense ratio combined ratio losses and settlement expenses insured events of current year increase decrease in provision for insured events of prior years total losses and settlement expenses catastrophe and storm losses year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company reported record net income of  per share in  an increase of percent from  per share reported in this large increase in net income is attributed to a significant improvement in underwriting results and a large increase in investment income stemming from an increase in invested assets 
in  the company generated an underwriting profit of  which includes  of favorable development on prior years reserves 
in  the company reported an underwriting loss of  which reflected  of adverse development on prior years reserves 
the company s invested assets increased substantially in due to the receipt of  in cash from employers mutual in connection with the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries increased participation in the pooling agreement 
net income for both and reflect a significant amount of hurricane losses 
the severe hurricane season  which produced hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  generated after tax losses of  per share  after factoring in reinstatement premium income net of related commission in the reinsurance segment and reinstatement premium expense in the property and casualty insurance segment 
the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in produced total after tax losses of  per share 
premium income premiums earned increased percent to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributed to the company s increased participation in the pooling agreement  but also reflects the impact of rate increases that were implemented in the property and casualty insurance business during on an overall basis  rate competition increased moderately in the property and casualty insurance marketplace during  however  there were indications of more intense competition in select territories and lines of business 
in response to the competitive market conditions  management implemented small premium rate decreases where deemed appropriate 
market conditions are expected to remain competitive in  particularly for non coastal business  as insurance companies seek to reduce their exposures to hurricane losses yet continue to grow their premiums 
management continues to emphasize its goal of achieving profitability over production 
achieving an underwriting profit is always stressed  but is even more critical in a lower interest rate environment 
premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased percent to  in from  in this increase is primarily the result of the change in pool participation 
to better understand the results of the property and casualty insurance segment for  it is helpful to look at the net pool numbers  which are not impacted by the change in pool participation 
for the pool  net premiums earned increased percent in  compared to an increase of percent in the small increase in the pool s earned premiums for reflects a transition from the implementation of moderate rate increases in to steady or declining premium rates in  as well as a continued decline in policy count 
increased rate competition during resulted in the implementation of some minor premium rate reductions in personal lines business and a slight increase in the use of discretionary credits in commercial lines business 
due to the timing of policy renewals and the earning of premiums ratably over the terms of the underlying policies  a time delay exists for implemented rate changes both increases and decreases to have a noticeable impact on premiums earned 
the company is attempting to address the loss of policy count through various measures  including programs geared towards small businesses and enhanced automation to make it easier and more efficient for agents to do business with the company 
during and  the pool participants ceded additional premiums totaling  and  respectively  to outside reinsurance companies to reinstate the pool s catastrophe reinsurance protection after the occurrence of large hurricane losses 
premiums written for the property and casualty insurance segment increased percent to  in from  in this increase is attributed to the change in pool participation and includes a portfolio adjustment of  which serves as an offset to the increase in the unearned premium reserve 
excluding this portfolio adjustment  premiums written increased percent in looking at the net pool numbers  which are not impacted by the change in pool participation  premiums written declined percent in during  commercial lines new business premium increased approximately percent and personal lines new business premium decreased approximately percent 
however  policy retention increased to percent in commercial lines and remained relatively steady in the personal lines at percent for property and percent for auto 
in light of current rate levels and the quality of the company s book of business  management is receptive to opportunities to write new business  but continues to stress profitability over production 
premiums earned for the reinsurance segment decreased percent to  in from  in this decline is attributed to the mrb pool  as the horad book of business produced a slight increase in earned premiums 
the amounts reported for and include reinstatement premium income of  and  respectively  received from ceding companies as a result of increased hurricane activity 
the large increase in reinstatement premium income in helped offset the loss of a significant account during while no significant new accounts were written during  employers mutual did add several new accounts during the january renewal season 
premium rate increases on excess of loss contracts remained relatively flat at both the january and july renewal periods  but the severe hurricane season spurred moderate rate increases during the january renewal period on contracts without significant catastrophe losses in  and large price increases and increased retention levels on contracts with significant catastrophe losses in many companies seeking reinsurance protection for sought higher coverage limits in response to the severe hurricane season  but the reinsurance subsidiary s overall exposure remained relatively constant as management continued to limit coastal area aggregate exposures 
premiums earned in reflect an increase in the estimate of earned but not reported premiums of  compared to decrease of  in as previously reported  the board of directors of the mrb pool  of which employers mutual is a member  has approved the admission of kentucky farm bureau mutual and country mutual insurance company as new assuming companies to the pool effective january  both of these companies carry an am best rating of a superior and their addition will enhance the financial strength of the pool 
these actions will provide increased diversification in the company s assumed reinsurance business and will reduce the company s exposure to catastrophe losses 
additionally  the company believes that the commitment of two highly rated  well capitalized companies to join the pool sends a strong message regarding the pool s future business prospects 
during and  the mrb pool consisted of three assuming companies who shared the reinsurance business equally 
the increase in the number of assuming companies in will have a short term negative impact on premiums earned for the company s reinsurance segment as the pool business will be split between more participants  however  the addition of these new companies will strengthen mrb s surplus base and should favorably impact future marketing efforts 
for calendar year  the reinsurance subsidiary s earned premiums from the mrb pool were approximately million 
based on preliminary production estimates from mrb  which do not include potential rate increases resulting from the severe hurricane season  the reinsurance subsidiary s earned premiums would have declined to approximately million in without the addition of the new assuming companies 
with the addition of the two new assuming companies  it is currently estimated that the reinsurance subsidiary s premiums earned from the mrb pool will decline to approximately million 
it is important to note that country mutual insurance company will only assume property exposures  casualty exposures will be shared among the other four participants 
as previously reported  employers mutual will no longer participate in a lloyd s of london marine syndicate effective january  due to a planned restructuring of that program 
the loss of this account will reduce the reinsurance subsidiary s premiums earned by approximately million in and an additional to million in employers mutual will attempt to replace this business through increased participation on other programs 
losses and settlement expenses losses and settlement expenses increased percent to  in from  in this increase is attributed to the company s increased participation in the pooling agreement 
the loss and settlement expense ratio declined to percent in from percent in this decline is primarily attributed to favorable development on prior years reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the property and casualty insurance segment decreased to percent in from percent in this improvement occurred despite a substantial increase in catastrophe and storm losses that was driven by the severe hurricane season 
losses from the hurricane season totaled  which compares to hurricane losses of  in the improvement in the loss and settlement expense ratio is primarily the result of  of favorable development experienced on prior years reserves  compared to  of adverse development experienced in the favorable development of is primarily attributed to downward development of individual case reserves and settlement expense reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated a bulk case reserve carried in the workers compensation line of business and reallocated a portion of this reserve to asbestos reserves and settlement expense reserves  resulting in  of favorable development 
the adverse development experienced in reflected a combination of newly reported claims in excess of carried ibnr reserves  development on case reserves of previously reported claims  bulk reserve strengthening  and settlement expense reserve increases resulting from increases in case reserves 
this adverse development was partially offset by  of reinsurance recoveries associated with the case reserve development and ibnr emergence 
substantial case reserve strengthening performed at the branch offices  primarily in the workers compensation and other liability lines of business  was the underlying reason for the adverse reserve development that occurred during as discussed further under the critical accounting policies heading of this discussion  the economic factors behind the case reserve strengthening included  most notably  an increase in workers compensation claim severity  increases in construction defect claim activity  the recent occurrence of several large umbrella claims  and increasing legal expenses in the other liability line of business 
claim frequency continued to decline during  but there are signs that it may be leveling out  especially in the workers compensation and homeowners lines of business 
claim severity increased in most lines of business with commercial auto liability being an exception 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment increased to percent in from percent in the increase in the ratio is attributed to a decline in the amount of favorable development experienced on prior years reserves  an increase in the severity of losses on working layer business and an increase in catastrophe and storm losses 
the favorable development experienced on prior years reserves in and is attributed to the horad book of business 
catastrophe and storm losses for amounted to  which reflects  from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma each capped at the  occurrence limit per event  approximately  from tropical storm erwin and  of adverse development from a hurricane 
catastrophe losses in amounted to  with three hurricanes being capped at the  occurrence limit per event 
as previously noted  employers mutual retained a significant amount of hurricane losses in excess of the  cap per event in this prompted changes to the terms and conditions of the quota share agreement for  including an increase in the cap on losses assumed per event from  to acquisition and other expenses acquisition and other expenses increased percent to  in from  in these increases are primarily attributed to the company s increased participation in the pooling agreement 
the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in this increase reflects higher salary expenses  hurricane related assessment costs and an increase in policyholder dividends 
for the property and casualty insurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in this increase is primarily attributed to higher salary expenses including bonus and contingent salary plan accruals  assessment costs associated with hurricane katrina from the louisiana citizens fair plan and the mississippi windstorm underwriting association and an increase in policyholder dividends 
the increase in the acquisition expense ratio was limited by a decline in contingent commission expense  which is attributed to changes in the agent profit sharing plan  and an increase in ceded contingent commission income 
the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries incurred  of commission expense in in connection with their increased participation in the pooling agreement 
this commission expense is used to reimburse employers mutual for the expenses it incurred to generate the additional insurance business that was transferred to the subsidiaries on january  however  due to the fact that acquisition expenses  including commissions  are deferred and amortized to expense as the related premiums are earned  all of the  of commission expense was capitalized as a deferred policy acquisition cost and is being amortized to expense as the unearned premiums become earned in order to provide a proper matching of acquisition expenses and premium revenue 
for the reinsurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio decreased to percent in from percent in the decline in the ratio is due to a large amount of contingent commission expense reported by mrb in commission expense for also includes  related to the increase in participation in the mrb pool from percent in to percent in  however  this expense was partially offset by an increase in the deferred policy acquisition costs asset 
investment results net investment income increased percent to  in from  in and is attributed to a significant increase in invested assets 
as previously discussed  the company received  in cash from employers mutual in february in connection with the percentage point increase in pool participation 
the company also received  of interest income from employers mutual as the actual cash settlement did not occur until february  the company reported net realized investment gains of  in compared to  in included in the realized investment gains of is  of gains recognized on the company s investment in mci communications corporation bonds in conjunction with a payout award received under a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
this gain was partially offset by  of other than temporary impairment losses recognized on the replacement bonds received in this settlement 
the company did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses in income tax income tax expense increased in in conjunction with an increase in pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased to percent in from percent in  reflecting a large growth in pre tax income relative to the amount of tax exempt interest income earned by the company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income decreased percent to  per share in from  per share in this decrease was attributed to a significant increase in the amount of adverse development experienced on prior years reserves 
the majority of this adverse development occurred during the fourth quarter and was attributed to a diligent review and re evaluation of the individual case reserves carried by the property and casualty insurance segment 
in addition to an ongoing review of claims files in the normal course of business  the company had for many years required each of its branch offices to perform a complete inventory of its open claim files during the fourth quarter of each year and to review the adequacy of each carried reserve based on current information 
this review process had not historically resulted in a significant increase in case reserves  however  because of heightened emphasis placed on case reserve adequacy during  the review performed in the fourth quarter of generated a significant and unanticipated increase in carried reserves and a corresponding increase in settlement expense reserves 
catastrophe and storm losses declined percent in  but remained at an unusually high level due to the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
the calculation of net income per share was impacted by the company s follow on stock offering in which million new shares of common stock were issued on october  the company earned approximately  of additional interest income on the net proceeds of the stock offering during the fourth quarter of  however  this additional interest income was not sufficient to avoid an approximate percent dilution in the net income per share calculation 
premium income premiums earned increased percent to  in from  in this increase was primarily attributed to rate increases implemented during the last few years in the property and casualty insurance business as well as moderate growth and improved pricing in the assumed reinsurance business 
the overall market for property and casualty insurance was stable during  but moderated slightly in certain lines of business and select territories due to an increase in price competition 
price competition was expected to increase for most lines of business in  but not to the extent seen in the last soft market 
the company will continue its efforts to maintain current pricing levels and will implement rate increases in those lines of business and or territories where such action is warranted  however  the overall impact of these rate increases will continue to dissipate as the increases become smaller and less frequent 
premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased percent to  in from  in this increase was primarily the result of rate increases that were implemented during the prior two years 
after the broad based rate increases implemented during the peak of the hard market in and  premium rate levels for most lines of business were considered to be at  or near  adequate levels at the end of accordingly  moderate and more targeted rate increases were implemented during and this fine tuning of the company s rate structure was directed toward specific accounts  territories and lines of business where additional rate increases were warranted 
due to the timing of policy renewals and the earning of premiums ratably over the terms of the underlying policies  a time delay exists for implemented rate increases to have a noticeable impact on premiums earned 
during  premiums written increased only percent due to a decline in policy count and an increase in ceded premiums 
the decline in policy count is attributed to several factors  including the non renewal of existing business that was under priced and or under performing  a reluctance to accept new risks in under priced lines of business and a decrease in new business associated with a moderate increase in price competition 
the increase in ceded premiums primarily reflects an increase in the cost of the company s reinsurance programs 
premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased percent to  in from  in due to increased participation in the mrb reinsurance pool 
for  employers mutual s participation in the mrb reinsurance pool which is ceded to the reinsurance segment under the terms of the quota share agreement increased to percent from percent in  producing  of additional premiums earned 
the increase in the mrb premiums earned was partially offset by a decline in the horad book of business because employers mutual was unsuccessful in its attempt to renew several accounts during the january and july  renewal seasons due to its a excellent am best rating 
following large across the board rate increases implemented in  premium rate increases on excess of loss contracts moderated during and due to the influx of new capital into the reinsurance marketplace  however  contracts with poor loss experience continued to receive large rate increases 
the rate increases implemented during the last several years were realized in conjunction with moderate declines in the related exposure base due to increased retention levels and coverage exclusions for terrorist activities 
in addition  both excess of loss and pro rata contracts benefited from improved industry wide rate levels at the primary company level 
premiums earned in reflect a decrease in the estimate of earned but not reported premiums of  compared to an increase of  in losses and settlement expenses losses and settlement expenses increased percent to  in from  in the loss and settlement expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the increase in the ratio is primarily attributed to a significant amount of adverse development on prior years reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment  but was partially offset by a decline in reported losses in the reinsurance segment 
catastrophe and storm losses declined percent in  but remained at an unusually high level 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the property and casualty insurance segment increased to percent in from percent in the increase in the ratio was primarily attributed to a significant increase in adverse development on prior years reserves 
the adverse development of reflects a combination of newly reported claims in excess of carried ibnr reserves  development on case reserves of previously reported claims  bulk reserve strengthening  and settlement expense reserve increases resulting from increases in case reserves 
this adverse development was partially offset by  of reinsurance recoveries associated with the case reserve development and ibnr emergence 
substantial case reserve strengthening performed at the branch offices  primarily in the workers compensation and other liability lines of business  was the underlying reason for the adverse reserve development that occurred during loss severity continued to trend upward during while overall loss frequency continued to trend downward  however  there were some indications that loss frequency might be leveling out 
catastrophe and storm losses for include  net of reinsurance from the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
the loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to percent in from percent in  despite an increase in catastrophe and storm losses 
the decline in the ratio reflects a decrease in the ratio of reported losses to premiums earned for policy year business  an increase in favorable development on prior years reserves and continued improvement in overall premium rate adequacy 
the favorable development experienced in was attributed to reported policy year losses for property  casualty and multi line classes that are below implicit projections 
catastrophe and storm losses for include  associated with the four hurricanes that hit the southern united states in august and september 
the reinsurance segment had exposure to all four hurricanes and reached its  cap on losses assumed per occurrence on three of them 
during  two events midwest storms in the month of may and hurricane isabel reached the  cap 
acquisition and other expenses acquisition and other expenses increased percent to  in from  in the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to increases in contingent commission and policyholder dividend expense 
for the property and casualty insurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the rise in this ratio was primarily attributed to an increase in contingent commission expense from the company s agent profit sharing plan and an increase in policyholder dividend expense 
the increase in contingent commission expense was partially offset by  of ceded contingent commission income recognized in the fourth quarter of related to a no claims bonus on the terrorism reinsurance contract for years and for the reinsurance segment  the acquisition expense ratio increased to percent in from percent in the increase was primarily attributed to a large amount of contingent commission expense reported by mrb during  but was reduced by a  increase in contingent commission income from a retrocession contract on the horad book of business 
both increases reflect recent favorable underwriting performance 
the asset for deferred acquisition costs increased in and in connection with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
these increases offset commission expense of  and  recorded for statutory purposes in those respective years with the increased participation in the mrb pool 
investment results net investment income remained relatively flat at  in compared to  in  despite an increase in invested assets 
this was primarily attributed to the lingering low interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted the rate of return earned on the company s investments 
during this prolonged period of low interest rates  many of the company s higher yielding securities have been called 
the proceeds from these called securities  and from maturing securities  have been reinvested at current lower interest rates  resulting in less investment income 
in addition  until the second quarter of the company had been reluctant to invest in long term securities due to the low interest rate environment  and had therefore accumulated a significant amount of short term and cash equivalent investments 
since these investments carry lower interest rates than long term securities  the decline in the company s rate of return was magnified 
however  during the second quarter of interest rates became more attractive and the company began investing in long term securities 
the company reported net realized investment gains of  in and  in the large amount of realized investment gains in includes  of net gain gross gain of  less an other than temporary loss of  recognized during the second quarter on the company s investment in mci communications corporation bonds in conjunction with a payout award received under a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
the mci bonds had previously been determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the second quarter of the new mci bonds were sold during the third quarter  resulting in an additional realized gain of  reflected in the gains of are  of other than temporary impairment losses recognized in the company s equity portfolio during the first quarter   of net losses recognized by the company s equity managers during the first quarter as they rebalanced the company s portfolios to enhance future returns  and  of losses recognized on the sale of american airlines and united airlines bonds during the first quarter 
these losses were more than offset by gains recognized on the sale of certain bond and equity investments during the remainder of all the impaired equity securities were sold before year end  generating gross realized gains of  and gross realized losses of  other information income tax expense decreased percent to  in from  in the effective tax rate declined to percent in from percent in  primarily due to an increase in tax exempt investment income and a decline in pre tax income 
effective april   the company was included in employers mutual s consolidated tax return due to the fact that employers mutual attained percent ownership of the company at the end of march 
the company filed a short period tax return with its subsidiaries for the period january through march  during october employers mutual s ownership of the company fell below percent upon successful completion of the follow on stock offering 
accordingly  the company was no longer included in employers mutual s consolidated tax return effective october   and the company filed a short period tax return for the period october  through december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet cash obligations as they come due 
the company generated positive cash flows from operations of  in   in and  in included in cash flows from operations in is  of cash received from employers mutual in connection with the change in pool participation 
excluding this amount  cash flows from operations for amounted to  the company typically generates substantial positive cash flows from operations because cash from premium payments is generally received in advance of cash payments made to settle claims 
these positive cash flows provide the foundation of the company s asset liability management program and are the primary drivers of the company s liquidity 
when investing funds made available from operations  the company invests in securities with maturities that approximate the anticipated payments of losses and settlement expenses of the underlying insurance policies 
in addition  the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid assets as a secondary source of liquidity should net cash flows from operating activities prove inadequate to fund current operating needs 
as of december   the company did not have any significant variations between the maturity dates of its investments and the expected payments of its loss and settlement expense reserves 
the company is a holding company whose principal assets are its investments in its insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company  the company is dependent upon cash dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 
state insurance regulations restrict the maximum amount of dividends insurance companies can pay without prior regulatory approval 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividend restrictions 
the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance company subsidiaries can pay to the company in without prior regulatory approval is approximately  the company received   and  of dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries and paid cash dividends to its stockholders totaling   and  in  and  respectively 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met  however  because of their participation in the pooling agreement and the quota share agreement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance or reinsurance company 
this is due to the fact that under the terms of the pooling and quota share agreements  employers mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the company s reinsurance subsidiary  and then settles the inter company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis 
at the insurance company subsidiary level  the primary sources of cash are premium income  investment income and maturing investments 
the principal outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt  and investment purchases 
cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses  either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  the insurance company subsidiaries maintain investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
the remainder of the investment portfolio  excluding investments in equity securities and other long term investments  is invested in securities with maturities that approximate the anticipated liabilities of the insurance written 
at december   approximately percent of the company s fixed maturity securities were in us government or us government agency issued securities 
a variety of maturities are maintained in the company s portfolio to assure adequate liquidity 
the maturity structure of the fixed maturity investments is also established by the relative attractiveness of yields on short  intermediate and long term securities 
the company does not invest in high yield  non investment grade debt securities  however  an exception was made to this policy in when non investment grade mci debt securities were sold and then repurchased in order to recognize a current income tax benefit 
the company considers itself to be a long term investor and generally purchases fixed maturity investments with the intent to hold them to maturity 
despite this intent  the company currently classifies purchases of fixed maturity investments as available for sale to provide flexibility in the management of the investment portfolio 
the company had unrealized holding gains  net of deferred taxes  on fixed maturity securities available for sale totaling  and  at december  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the market value of these investments is primarily due to changes in the interest rate environment during this time period 
since the company does not actively trade in the bond market  such fluctuations in the fair value of these investments are not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company  as forced liquidations of investments are not anticipated 
the company closely monitors the bond market and makes appropriate adjustments in its portfolio as changing conditions warrant 
the majority of the company s assets are invested in fixed maturity securities 
these investments provide a substantial amount of investment income that supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings 
as these investments mature  or are called  the proceeds will be reinvested at current rates  which may be higher or lower than those now being earned  therefore  more or less investment income may be available to contribute to net earnings depending on the interest rate level 
the company participates in a securities lending program administered by mellon bank  na whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
the company receives a fee for each security loaned out under this program and requires initial collateral  primarily cash  equal to percent of the market value of the loaned securities 
the cash collateral that secures the company s loaned securities is invested in a delaware statutory trust that is managed by mellon bank 
the earnings from this trust are used  in part  to pay the fee the company receives for each security loaned under the program 
the company held  and  in minority ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies at december  and  respectively 
the company does not hold any other unregistered securities 
the company s cash balance was  and  at december  and  respectively 
employers mutual contributed   and  to the pension plan in  and  respectively  and plans to contribute approximately  to the pension plan in the company reimbursed employers mutual   and  for its share of the pension contributions in  and  respectively 
employers mutual contributed   and  to the postretirement benefit plans in  and  respectively  and expects to contribute approximately  to the postretirement benefit plan in the company reimbursed employers mutual   and  for its share of the postretirement benefit plan contributions in  and  respectively 
in the company received reimbursement from employer mutual for a net  of pension assets and  of postretirement benefit liabilities transferred to it in connection with the change in pool participation 
capital resources capital resources consist of stockholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations 
for the company s insurance subsidiaries  capital resources are required to support premium writings 
regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to its statutory surplus should not exceed three to one 
all of the company s insurance subsidiaries were well under this guideline at december  the company s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum surplus on a statutory basis and are subject to regulations under which payment of dividends from statutory surplus is restricted and may require prior approval of their domiciliary insurance regulatory authorities 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to risk based capital rbc requirements that may further impact their ability to pay dividends 
rbc requirements attempt to measure minimum statutory capital needs based upon the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
at december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of  which is well in excess of the minimum rbc requirement of  the company had total cash and invested assets with a carrying value of million and million as of december  and  respectively

these surplus notes have an annual interest rate of percent effective april  upon their reissue and do not have a maturity date 
payment of interest and repayment of principal can only be made out of the applicable subsidiary s statutory surplus and is subject to prior approval by the insurance commissioner of the respective state of domicile 
the surplus notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all obligations or liabilities of the applicable insurance subsidiaries 
the company s subsidiaries incurred interest expense of   and  in  and  respectively  on these surplus notes 
at december   the company s subsidiaries had received approval for the payment of interest accrued on the surplus notes during as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements employers mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the reinsurance subsidiary and the insurance business produced by the pool participants  and then settles the inter company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis 
when settling the inter company balances  employers mutual provides the reinsurance subsidiary and the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by employers mutual and the expense is charged to the reinsurance subsidiary or allocated to the pool members on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  the company has an off balance sheet arrangement with an unconsolidated entity that results in a credit risk exposure that is not reflected in the company s financial statements 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
investment impairments and considerations the company did not record any other than temporary investment impairments during during the company had one fixed maturity security series mci communications corporation that was determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
mci communications corporation was owned by worldcom inc  whose corporate bonds were downgraded to junk status in may when it reported the detection of accounting irregularities 
on june  the company recognized  of realized loss when the carrying value of this investment was reduced from an aggregate book value of  to the then current fair value of  the fair value of the mci bonds then partially recovered  resulting in pre tax unrealized gains of  recognized during and  recognized during during the second quarter of the company received three new series of fixed maturity securities with impaired book values issued by mci communications corporation in conjunction with a payout award received under a bankruptcy court approved plan of reorganization 
this payout was recorded as a tax free exchange and the new bonds were assigned a book value equal to the book value of the defaulted bonds that were replaced 
the par value of the new bonds reflected the settlement amount of cents per dollar  and the fair value of the new bonds was  at the time of the payout 
based on these facts  a realized investment gain of  was recognized in the second quarter of to offset the other than temporary impairment loss previously recognized in the second quarter of and an other than temporary impairment loss of  was recognized to reduce the book value of the new bonds to fair value at the time of the payout 
the new bonds were sold during the third quarter of for income tax purposes  resulting in an additional realized gain of  at december   the company had unrealized losses on held to maturity and available for sale securities as presented in the table below 
the estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
none of these securities are considered to be in concentrations by either security type or industry 
the company uses several factors to determine whether the carrying value of an individual security has been other than temporarily impaired 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the security s value and performance in the context of the overall markets  length of time and extent the security s fair value has been below carrying value  key corporate events and collateralization of fixed maturity securities 
based on these factors  and the company s ability and intent to hold the fixed maturity securities until maturity  it was determined that the carrying value of these securities was not other than temporarily impaired at december  risks and uncertainties inherent in the methodology utilized in this evaluation process include interest rate risk  equity price risk and the overall performance of the economy  all of which have the potential to adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
should a determination be made at some point in the future that these unrealized losses are other than temporary  the company s earnings would be reduced by approximately  net of tax  however  the company s financial position would not be affected due to the fact that unrealized losses on available for sale securities are reflected in the company s financial statements as a component of stockholders equity  net of deferred taxes

the company does not purchase non investment grade securities 
any non investment grade securities held by the company are the result of rating downgrades that occurred subsequent to their purchase 
an exception was made to this policy in when the company sold  and then repurchased  non investment grade mci debt securities moody s bond rating of b in order to recognize a current income tax benefit 
following is a schedule of gross realized losses recognized in along with the associated book values and sales prices aged according to the length of time the underlying securities were in an unrealized loss position 
this schedule does not include realized losses stemming from corporate actions such as calls  pay downs  redemptions  etc 
the company s equity portfolio is managed on a tax aware basis  which generally results in sales of securities at a loss to offset sales of securities at a gain  thus minimizing the company s income tax expense

market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the company are to maximize after tax investment return while minimizing credit risks  in order to provide maximum support for the underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based upon many factors including underwriting results and the company s resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals and are supervised by the investment committees of the respective board of directors for each of the company s subsidiaries 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks of the financial instruments of the company relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to interest rate and equity price risk and  to a lesser extent  credit quality and prepayment risk 
monitoring systems and analytical tools are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk includes the price sensitivity of a fixed maturity security to changes in interest rates  and the affect on future earnings from short term investments and maturing long term investments given a change in interest rates 
the following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a corresponding pre tax decrease in the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio of approximately  or percent 
in addition  a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates at december  would result in a corresponding decrease in pre tax income over the next twelve months of approximately  assuming the current maturity and prepayment patterns 
the company monitors interest rate risk through the analysis of interest rate simulations  and adjusts the average duration of its fixed maturity portfolio by investing in either longer or shorter term instruments given the results of interest rate simulations and judgments of cash flow needs 
the effective duration of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  was years 
the valuation of the company s marketable equity portfolios is subject to equity price risk 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than bonds 
however  returns from equity securities have been consistently higher over longer time frames 
the company invests in a diversified portfolio of readily marketable equity securities 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the s p index as of december  would result in a corresponding pre tax decrease in the fair value of the company s equity portfolio of approximately  the company invests in high quality fixed maturity securities  thus minimizing credit quality risk 
at december   the portfolio of long term fixed maturity securities consisted of percent us treasury  percent government agency  percent mortgage backed  percent municipal  and percent corporate securities 
at december   the portfolio of long term fixed maturity securities consisted of percent us treasury  percent government agency  percent mortgage backed  percent municipal  and percent corporate securities 
fixed maturity securities held by the company generally have an investment quality rating of a or better by independent rating agencies 
the following table shows the composition of the company s fixed maturity securities  by rating  as of december  securities securities held to maturity available for sale at amortized cost at fair value in thousands amount percent amount percent rating aaa aa a baa ba total fixed maturities ratings for preferred stocks and fixed maturity securities with initial maturities greater than one year are assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations referred to generically as nrsros  which includes such organizations as moody s investor s services  inc  standard and poor  etc nrsros rating processes seek to evaluate the quality of a security by examining the factors that affect returns to investors 
nrsros ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative factors  as well as the economic  social and political environment in which the issuing entity exists 
the quantitative factors include debt coverage  sales and income growth  cash flows and liquidity ratios 
qualitative factors include management quality  access to capital markets and the quality of earnings and balance sheet items 
ratings for securities with initial maturities less than one year are based on ratings of nrsros or the credit rating of the issuer s parent company 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can shorten or lengthen the expected timing of principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
prepayment risk is monitored regularly through the analysis of interest rate simulations 
at december   the effective duration of the mortgage backed securities is years with an average life and current yield of years and percent  respectively 
at december   the effective duration of the mortgage backed securities was years with an average life and current yield of years and percent  respectively 
impact of inflation inflation has a widespread effect on the company s results of operations  primarily through increased losses and settlement expenses
