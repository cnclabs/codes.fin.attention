item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of a diversified portfolio of well recognized branded consumer products 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our sales from products in the number one or number two dollar market share position in the united states 
at december   our lines of business include feminine care  skin care and infant care products 
in late  we completed the sale of the remaining non core brand assets 
the divested brand assets included intellectual property  inventory  molds and equipment for the baby magic  mr 
bubble  ogilvie  binaca  dorothy gray  dentax  tek  tussy  chubs and better off brands see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
these non core brand assets accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our results include the impact of the non core brands sales and operating income through late including fees and expenses  we recorded a net loss of million on the sale of the non core brand assets on net proceeds of million 
in we acquired certain distribution rights associated with our banana boat product for million 
these acquisitions give us full control over the banana boat franchise and reduce complexity related to the management of third party distributorships 
in february  we announced a realignment of our business to improve focus on our core categories  reduce organizational complexity and obtain a more competitive cost structure 
this is a continuation of our operational restructuring which began in late some of the specific realignment initiatives include consolidation of the us international divisional structure in favor of a product category structure  realignment of the sales and marketing organizations and related support functions  rationalization of manufacturing  warehousing and office facilities  including the outsourcing of gloves production to malaysia  the closing of our manufacturing facility in canada  and a reduction in the corporate headquarters office space 
we estimate that annual savings related to the realignment will be approximately million  which will be fully realized in savings in  before restructuring and related costs of million  were approximately million 
during  we utilized available cash generated from the sale of non core brand assets and the net cash provided by operations to repurchase million principal of our senior secured notes due notes  at a premium of million 
in  we may continue to repurchase our notes and possibly call a portion of our senior subordinated notes due the notes  collectively  the notes  starting in june in accordance with the indentures for the notes

year ended december  december  december  net sales feminine care skin care infant care divested cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring  net loss on impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangibles total operating expenses loss gain on sale of assets operating income interest expense  net expenses related to retirement of debt  net other expenses income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our consolidated net sales decreased million  or  to million in this decrease was due to the impact of the divestiture of the non core brand assets 
net sales of the divested non core brands were down million versus the full year exclusive of the divestitures  net sales increased million  or  in as compared to the similar period in net sales in the feminine care segment increased million  or  to million in this increase is due to higher shipments of gentle glide due  in part  to the introduction of the count multi pack product and increased advertising and promotion for this key brand 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of a price reduction on beyond to position the product more competitively and lower beyond sales due to pipeline volume for the initial launch of the product in the first quarter of overall  our tampon dollar market share has remained relatively stable since the fourth quarter of at approximately 
net sales in the skin care segment increased million  or  to million in the increase in net sales is due primarily to increased shipments in wet ones and banana boat 
wet ones net sales were higher in fiscal as consumption in the pre moistened towelette category continued to show positive growth trends and improved distribution  including front end placement at certain key retailers 
shipments of banana boat were above year ago due to higher consumption in the us sun care category resulting in improved product sell through for the season and higher international shipments in versus net sales in the infant care segment increased million  or  to million in due primarily to higher shipments of hip hammock and pacifiers versus the comparable period in while shipments in hard bottles were up  this increase was offset by lower disposable bottle shipments as competitive activity  particularly in private label  continued in this area 
net sales in cups and diaper genie were up slightly year over year 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit decreased by only million to million in despite lower comparative net sales 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased basis points to in versus in the increased gross profit margin was due primarily to the restructuring and realignment savings  a lower sun care returns rate and the positive impacts from the acquisition of the remaining banana boat distribution rights 
these positive impacts were partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs versus the prior year 
operating income our consolidated operating income decreased million  or  to million in fiscal included in operating income in was a net loss of million associated with the sale of the remaining non core brands while had a net gain of million from the sale of the woolite assets 
exclusive of the impact of the gains losses from the sales of the divested brand assets in each period  operating income would have increased by million in fiscal versus fiscal this increase was due to an impairment charge of million in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of certain trademarks  lower restructuring charges of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to our realignment program and lower sg a expenses of million 
the net decrease in sg a of million as compared to fiscal was driven by restructuring and realignment savings  partially offset by equity compensation expenses from new compensation plans of million  higher net legal expenses  and increased advertising and promotion spending 
amortization of intangibles increased by million as compared to fiscal due primarily to a full year of amortization of the non compete agreement for the former ceo as compared to only one quarter in interest expense  net our consolidated interest expense  net decreased million to million in the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the repurchase on the open market of million principal amount of notes during and higher interest income in on available cash balances 
expenses related to retirement of debt in  we repurchased on the open market  and subsequently canceled  million principal amount of our notes at a premium of million 
in addition  we wrote off million of unamortized deferred financing fees  representing a pro rata portion of the unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the repurchased notes 
on february   we terminated our then outstanding credit facility and receivables facility 
as a result  we wrote off approximately million in unamortized deferred financing fees relating to these facilities 
in addition  we recorded a gain of million  which was partially offset by a write off of million of unamortized deferred financing fees  as a result of the repurchase on the open market of million principal of our notes see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
other expenses our consolidated other expenses in were primarily the costs associated with our receivables facility 
this facility was terminated as a result of our refinancing on february  provision benefit for income taxes our consolidated income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to a consolidated income tax benefit of million in fiscal included in is a tax benefit of million to reflect the reduced tax rate associated with the special repatriation of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under the american jobs creation act of in addition  we divested the remaining non core assets resulting in a million loss for financial reporting purposes 
this divestiture included million of non deductible goodwill and a million capital loss for tax reporting purposes 
the future tax benefit of the capital loss carryover that expires in was fully reserved due to the uncertainty of its future utilization 
the additional federal and state tax expense included in the provision for income taxes related to the non core asset sales noted above was million 
included in was a million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward 
we had established a valuation allowance because we did not believe that we would utilize this capital loss carryforward before its expiration in december however  as a result of the gain generated by the sale of certain woolite assets in november  we were able to utilize a portion of this capital loss carryforward resulting in a reversal of the valuation allowance noted 
in addition  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in as a result of the favorable outcome of certain tax audits 
our effective tax rate is for compared to in excluding the impact of the dividend received deduction  change in valuation allowance for capital loss carryforward and non deductible goodwill associated with sale of non core brands noted above our effective tax rate would have been  compared to in excluding the impact of the tax benefit from the utilization of the capital loss carryforward associated with the sale of assets of the woolite rug and upholstery brand and benefit of favorable foreign tax audit noted above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million in net sales in the feminine care segment increased million  or  to million in this increase is due primarily to higher shipment volume driven by the launch of beyond  our cardboard applicator tampon  in the first quarter of and stabilization of our overall tampon market share 
our tampon market share has been relatively flat since the fourth quarter of net sales in the skin care segment increased million  or  to million in the increase in net sales is due primarily to higher shipment volume in sun care related to improved weather versus the prior year 
in  poor weather conditions resulted in decreased consumption of banana boat 
we shifted product shipments closer to consumption in as a result  was positively impacted by the shift of approximately million of shipments from the fourth quarter of into the first quarter of this was a continuation of a trend noted in in addition  shipments of wet ones were higher in fiscal versus fiscal due to continued consumption growth in the category 
net sales in the infant care segment were essentially flat at approximately million in when compared to volume 
higher shipment volume versus the comparable period in disposable and reusable bottles was offset by lower shipments in cups as competitive activity continued in this category 
net sales in the divested segment inclusive of those brands divested in and amounted to million in as compared to million in this decrease in net sales was due primarily to the sale of the assets of the woolite rug and upholstery brand on november  and lower shipment volumes of our other recently divested non core brands  which was due primarily to declining category trends 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to million in as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased basis points to in versus the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in net sales  which accounted for approximately million 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due primarily to improved product costs due  in part  to the first phase of our operational restructuring efforts announced in operating income our consolidated operating income increased million  or  to million in fiscal this increase was driven by a gain on the sale of woolite assets of million partially offset by a loss on intangible asset impairment of million and net restructuring charges of million 
in fiscal  operating income was negatively impacted by a restructuring charge of million 
exclusive of these items  consolidated operating income increased million or as compared to fiscal this increase was due to higher gross profit of million driven by higher net sales partially offset by higher sg a of million as compared to fiscal the increase in sg a of million as compared to fiscal was driven by million of consulting and restructuring related costs as a result of our realignment initiatives  million of costs associated with implementation of the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and higher advertising and promotional expenses of million 
included in sg a for fiscal were million of tampon litigation costs  which were reduced to million in fiscal operating income in was also positively impacted by million of out of period adjustments related primarily to a reduction of our estimate for advertising and promotional costs 
amortization of intangibles increased by million as compared to fiscal due primarily to the commencement of amortization of the non compete agreement for the former ceo in the fourth quarter of interest expense  net our consolidated interest expense  net increased million to million in the increase in interest expense is the result of higher interest rates on outstanding debt driven by the refinancing of our then existing senior debt in february the refinancing changed the composition of our debt such that we have considerably less variable rate indebtedness  although at higher interest rates  and more fixed rate debt 
in  our weighted average interest rate for all debt was for the year ended december   up percentage points versus the prior year 
our average debt balances decreased by million in versus expenses related to retirement of debt on february   we refinanced our then outstanding credit facility and terminated our receivables facility 
we wrote off approximately million in unamortized deferred financing fees relating to our then outstanding term c loan  revolver  credit agreement and related amendments and million of an unamortized fee paid to originate the receivables facility in in addition  we recorded a net gain of million  which included a write off of million of unamortized deferred financing fees  as the result of the repurchase on the open market of the million principal of our notes see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
other expenses our consolidated other expenses were primarily the costs associated with our receivables facility 
since this facility was terminated as a result of our refinancing in february  costs associated with this facility decreased for fiscal  versus the prior year  by million 
provision benefit for income taxes our consolidated income tax benefit was million for fiscal compared to million of consolidated income tax expense in fiscal included in was a million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance on a capital loss carryforward 
we had established a valuation allowance because we did not believe that we would utilize this capital loss carryforward before its expiration in december however  as a result of the gain generated by the sale of certain woolite assets  we were able to utilize a portion of this capital loss carryforward resulting in a reversal of the valuation allowance noted 
in addition  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in as a result of the favorable outcome of certain tax audits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at december  this decrease in cash was primarily the result of the repurchase of million principal amount of notes on the open market during  at a premium of million 
the cash balance was positively impacted by the net proceeds from the sale of the remaining non core assets in late of million 
the remaining change in cash was due to the positive impact of net cash provided by operations and proceeds from stock issuance associated with the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the purchase of certain capital and intangible assets 
we invest our cash in highly liquid  us government or other highly rated investments  as stipulated by our credit agreement 
the cash on hand at december  may be used to repurchase bonds on the open market  depending upon availability and price  and we may call a portion of our notes in accordance with the indenture  to finance investments in our brands and to make scheduled bond interest payments 
in  during the period from january to march   we have repurchased and retired an additional million principal amount of our notes 
cash flows analysis in thousands year ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operations net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net cash provided by operations our net cash provided by operations decreased million to million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations was due primarily to higher cash payments for taxes of million due primarily to higher pre tax income in fiscal exclusive of the large pre tax gain on the sale of brand assets in fiscal  which was substantially excluded from taxes due to a capital loss carryforward  incremental cash payments of million as compared to fiscal for our operational restructuring and realignment program and higher cash interest payments of million due to timing of interest payment dates 
these increases in cash payments in fiscal were offset  in part  by an increase in cash operating income and continued improvement in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities our cash provided by investing activities of million was primarily driven by the net proceeds from the sale of the remaining non core brand assets of million 
this was partially offset by payments of million for intangible assets  of which million was for the purchase of certain banana boat distribution rights  million for certain licensing arrangements and million to our former ceo as part of a non compete agreement 
our capital expenditures to support new products  upgrade production equipment  invest in new technologies and improve our facilities were million in capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
net cash used for financing activities our cash used for financing activities of million in was the result of the repurchase on the open market and subsequent retirement of million principal amount of our notes plus related premiums of million 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
in addition  our canadian subsidiary drew down million from its revolving line of credit  established in  to finance its own working capital needs and shift a portion of our debt to the canadian balance sheet  which reduces taxable income in canada 
we intend to fund our operating cash  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolvers through fiscal however  we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to make either the million scheduled principal payment on the notes  as adjusted for note repurchases subsequent to year end  or the million notes  both due in fiscal accordingly  we may have to refinance our obligations  sell assets or raise equity capital to repay the principal amounts of these obligations 
historically  our cash from operations and refinancing activities have enabled us to meet all of our obligations 
however  we cannot guarantee that our operating results will continue to be sufficient or that future borrowing facilities will be available for the payment or refinancing of our debt on economically attractive terms 
we have a variable rate credit facility comprised of a million revolving credit facility for use in the united states and a million canadian revolving credit facility for use in canada collectively  the revolver 
the availability under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation  which is dependent upon the level of certain assets including eligible receivables  eligible inventory and eligible equipment  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   our availability under the revolver  based on our borrowing base calculation  is million  as reduced for our outstanding balance of million in canada and outstanding letters of credit  as defined in the credit agreement 
the rates of interest we have paid in the past  and will continue to pay in the future  on our revolver are  at our option  a function of various alternative short term borrowing rates  such as the prime rate or the london inter bank offer rate libor 
the vast majority of our indebtedness at december  is comprised of fixed rate notes 
as a result  at december   our exposure to changing interest rates is not significant 
a one percentage point change in our variable interest rate would not have a material impact on our consolidated interest expense 
due to the attributes of our debt portfolio  reductions of our outstanding debt may require that we repurchase bonds on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  under certain call provisions provided in the note indentures  or otherwise from time to time 
such repurchases may be subject to bond availability and may require substantial premiums depending on prices in the marketplace and the call provisions 
our credit agreements and the indentures to our notes contain various restrictions and limitations that may impact us 
these restrictions and limitations relate to incurrence of indebtedness  contingent obligations  liens  capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions  redemption or repurchase of equity interests  certain debt payments and modifications  loans and investments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control  payment of consulting and management fees  and compliance with laws and regulations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations and other total does not include interest 
includes open purchase orders primarily for the procurement of raw materials  packaging and supplies for use in the production process 
excludes severance payments under the strategic realignment plan see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses  the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could vary from our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results  assumptions that we make  as well as assumptions by third parties 
key areas where assumptions and estimates are used include sun care returns our practice is not to accept returned goods unless authorized by management of the sales organization 
returns result primarily from damage and shipping discrepancies 
exceptions to this policy include our sun care seasonal returns 
under certain circumstances  we allow customers to return sun care products that have not been sold by the end of the sun care season  which is normal practice in the sun care industry 
we record sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
the terms of these sales vary but  in all instances  the following conditions are met the sales arrangement is evidenced by purchase orders submitted by customers  the selling price is fixed or determinable  product has shipped and title transferred  there is an obligation to pay at a specified date or dates without any additional conditions or actions required by us  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
simultaneously with the time of the shipment  we reduce sales and cost of sales  and reserve amounts on our consolidated balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level  in accordance with gaap 
customers are required to pay for the sun care product purchased during the season under the required terms 
due to the seasonal nature of sun care  we offer a limited extension of terms to certain qualified customers 
this limited extension requires substantial cash payments prior to or during the summer sun care season 
we generally receive returns of our sun care products from september through march following the summer sun care season 
we estimate the level of sun care returns using a variety of inputs including historical experience  consumption trends during the sun care season and inventory positions at key retailers as we move through the sun care season 
we monitor shipment activity and inventory levels at key retailers during the season in an effort to gauge potential returns issues 
this allows us to manage shipment activity to our customers  especially in the latter stages of the sun care season  to reduce the potential for returned product 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels  and competitive conditions 
based on our sun care results  each percentage point change in our returns rate would have impacted our reported net sales by million and our reported operating income by million 
bad debt reserves the extension of trade credit carries with it the chance that the customer may not pay for the goods when payment is due 
we measure past due status based on the date the invoice is due 
we review our receivables portfolio and provide reserves for potential bad debts including those we know about and those that have not been identified but may exist due to the risk associated with the granting of credit 
the estimated reserves required to cover potential losses are developed using historical experience  analysis of our accounts receivable aging and the overall credit worthiness of our portfolio of customers 
reserve balances are based on the best information available to us and are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the adequacy of the estimated reserve may be impacted by the deterioration of a large customer and or significant weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings 
long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  are evaluated periodically for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow requires significant management judgment and requires  among other things  certain assumptions about future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and as such  may differ from actual cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments  similar to those noted above for long lived assets  and for the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we measure the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 for purposes of testing the appropriateness of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we do this by estimating the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill  to ensure no impairment is indicated 
we measure fair value for purposes of testing our trademarks for impairment using the relief from royalty method a discounted cash flow methodology 
our research indicates that this is the most widely used approach for valuing assets of this type 
we consider a number of factors in determining the relevant variables for this calculation including royalty rates for similar products licensed in the marketplace and the additional rights and obligations inherent in the ownership of a trademark as opposed to a licensing arrangement including product extension  geographical expansion opportunities  exclusivity of use and transferability 
in addition  we utilize a discount rate that reflects the rights and obligations of ownership  which results in an inherent premium as compared to a valuation of a licensing agreement since the discount rate of a licensee would reflect the additional risks of a license only arrangement 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
we use our judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired 
in  we reorganized our business segments as a result of our strategic realignment 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we reallocated goodwill to our new reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
promotion accruals we offer a variety of sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as cooperative advertising programs  feature price discounts  in store display incentives and consumer coupons 
the recognition of the costs for these programs  which are classified as a reduction of revenue  involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
we account for these programs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
issue  accounting for consideration by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s product 
settlement of associated liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to us 
as a result  the ultimate cost of certain trade promotion programs is dependent on the relative success of the events 
accruals for consumer coupons are made at the time the coupon is distributed 
these estimates are made utilizing the value of the coupon and the expected redemption rates 
expected redemption rates are determined using historical redemption experience for similar programs 
we monitor monthly redemption activity with the assistance of a third party  which tracks actual redemptions and provides updated estimates for future redemptions of the coupons 
actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates 
restructuring and related charges restructuring liabilities are recorded for estimated costs of facility closures  significant organizational adjustments  and measures undertaken by us to exit certain activities 
we estimate the costs of such activities after evaluating detailed analyses of the cost to be incurred 
such liabilities could include amounts for items such as severance costs and related benefits including settlements of pension plans  impairment of property and equipment or other assets  lease termination payments  plus any other items directly related to the exit activities 
while the actions are carried out as expeditiously as possible  restructuring and related charges are estimates 
changes in estimates resulting in an increase to or a reversal of a previously recorded liability may be required as we execute the restructuring plan 
during fiscal  we adopted the requirements of sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which impacts the timing of recognition of certain exit or disposal costs 
restructuring and related charges  which are reflected in operating expenses  include but are not limited to  termination and related costs  any asset impairments relating to the restructuring  and other costs directly related to the initiatives implemented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of restructuring initiatives and related costs 
pension and postretirement benefits included in our results of operations are pension and postretirement costs and credits  which are measured using actuarial valuations  with associated assets and or liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including assumptions about discount rates  expected return on plan assets  annualized increases in salaries and wages  the future number of participants and  in the case of postretirement health care benefits  the future cost of health care 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would change the sum of the service and interest cost components of the fiscal net periodic postretirement benefit expense by less than 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by less than 
a one percentage point change up or down in the discount rate or in the long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a significant impact on net periodic pension expense 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no

 we follow the intrinsic value approach of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
issued for determining compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options 
accordingly  we have not recorded any expense for our stock options that vested solely on continuous service 
in accordance with apb no 
 we have recorded million of compensation expense in fiscal related to the issuance of restricted stock  performance restricted stock and performance based stock options during the same period 
the expense for restricted stock awards was based upon the closing price of our stock on the date of the award amortized over the associated service period 
the expense for the performance restricted shares was based on management s estimation of the performance awards that will vest over the associated service period and the spread between the recipient s basis in the award  which is par value  and the closing stock price at the end of the fiscal period 
the expense for the performance stock options was based on management s estimation of the performance awards that will vest over the associated service period and the spread between the option grant price and the closing stock price at the end of the fiscal period 
there were no charges to income for stock based compensation plans in fiscal and as noted in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment in the first quarter of fiscal this new accounting pronouncement will require us to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed above  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion

r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from stock based payment arrangements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec indicated that it would not require companies to record any expense in accordance with sfas no 
r until the first annual period beginning after june   which is fiscal for us see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we have adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning january  for all share based payments granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on that date 
we estimate the charge to pre tax income for our stock based compensation plans in fiscal year will be in the range of to million 
the following factors and management assumptions may impact this estimate and other future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period the company s future stock based compensation strategy including the timing  size and composition of new equity grants  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures  employee stock option exercise behavior  and the attainment levels of associated performance criteria 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the company s stock at the time of exercise 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires such costs to be treated as a current period expense 
this statement is effective for our first quarter of fiscal we do not believe this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk substantially all of our indebtedness at december  is comprised of fixed rate notes see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we have in the past and may in the future use financial instruments  such as derivatives  to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our debt and its effect on our income and cash flows 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for the sole purpose of trading for profit on price fluctuations  or to enter into contracts  which intentionally increase our underlying interest rate exposure 
our indebtedness at december  was comprised of million of notes  million of notes and million of a variable rate revolving line of credit 
as such  at december   a one percentage point change in our variable interest rate would not have a material impact on our consolidated interest expense 
for the fiscal year ended december   we derived approximately of net sales in currencies denominated other than the us dollar  of which approximately was from our canadian subsidiary 
we conduct our international operations in a variety of countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar  as well as the us dollar 
our results may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
the majority of our products are manufactured in the us  but we do source some equipment  finished goods  componentry and raw materials from overseas  the majority of which is denominated in us dollars
