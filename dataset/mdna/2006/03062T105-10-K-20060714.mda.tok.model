overview america s car mart  inc  a texas corporation the company  is the largest publicly held automotive retailer in the united states focused exclusively on the buy here pay here segment of the used car market 
references to the company typically include the company s consolidated subsidiaries 
the company s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries  america s car mart  inc  an arkansas corporation car mart of arkansas  and colonial auto finance  inc colonial 
collectively  car mart of arkansas and colonial are referred to herein as car mart 
the company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers 
many of the company s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems 
as of april   the company operated stores located primarily in small cities throughout the south central united states 
car mart has been operating since car mart has grown its revenues between and per year over the last nine years 
historically  finance receivables have tended to grow slightly faster than revenues 
in fiscal finance receivables grew compared to revenue growth of 
the increase primarily relates to an increase in the average term for installment sales contracts to months  the timing of customer payments  particularly at year end  the purchase of finance receivables from dan s auto sales in lexington  ky in march  the increase in the percentage of day plus past due amounts at year end to  and an increase in the average interest rate charged resulting in a higher percentage of customer payments going to interest as opposed to principle reduction 
revenue growth results from same store revenue growth and the addition of new stores 
revenue growth in fiscal was slightly ahead of the company s growth expectations of to 
revenue growth in fiscal was assisted by a increase in the average retail sales price and a growth in retail unit sales 
typically  annual price increases are in the to range 
presently  the company expects that its average retail sales price will increase in fiscal  but at a rate slightly lower than its historical average annual price increase 
unit sales are expected to increase at a faster rate than resulting from new store additions and same store revenue growth 
as a result  revenue growth for fiscal is presently expected to be in the to range 
the company s primary focus is on collections 
each store is responsible for its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office 
over the last five fiscal years  car mart s credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged between approximately and average of 
for the last two fiscal years  credit losses as a percentage of sales have averaged 
credit losses in fiscal were higher than the company s average over the last five years 
credit losses in fiscal were negatively affected by higher losses experienced during the company s second quarter 
significant negative external economic issues  including higher fuel prices  were prevalent during fiscal year  concentrated to a large extent in the second quarter 
also during the second quarter  significant efforts were made by store management to identify  clean up and write off uncollectible accounts 
credit losses were  and for the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal in february  the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
historical data indicates that loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
lower priced vehicles tend to have more mechanical difficulties that often result in a higher level of repossessions 
the effects of the company s february decision to reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles is reflected in the lower provision for credit losses  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal when compared to fiscal the company s gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year 
over the last nine fiscal years  car mart s gross margins as a percentage of sales have ranged between approximately and 
gross margins as a percentage of sales for fiscal were for the fourth quarter 
this is down from for fiscal for the fourth quarter 
the company s gross margins are set based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased  with lower priced vehicles having higher gross margin percentages 
the company s gross margins have been negatively affected by the increase in the average retail sales price a function of a higher purchase price and to a lesser extent by higher operating costs  mostly related to increased vehicle repair costs and higher fuel and transport costs 
short term supply issues during fiscal  most prevalent during the final three quarters brought on by hurricanes katrina and rita and by the slow down in domestic new car sales  have resulted in higher purchase costs for vehicles 
the company expects that its gross margin percentage will not change significantly in the future from its current level 
hiring  training and retaining qualified associates are critical to the company s success 
the rate at which the company adds new stores is sometimes limited by the number of trained managers the company has at its disposal 
excessive turnover  particularly at the store manager level  could impact the company s ability to add new stores 
in fiscal and  the company added resources to train and develop personnel 
the company expects to continue to invest in the development of its workforce in fiscal and beyond

the decrease in compensation expense  as a percentage of sales  is partially the result of selling higher priced vehicles 
selling higher priced vehicles increases sales without necessarily increasing compensation expense 
the decrease in compensation expense was offset  to an extent  by other expense increases including utility and travel costs which increased as a result of the increase in fuel prices during the year  charges associated with the legal settlement with astoria entertainment  inc see note k to the consolidated financial statements  and increased costs in the information technology department and other corporate infrastructure areas to strengthen controls  improve efficiencies and allow for continued growth

revenues increased in fiscal as compared to revenue growth of in fiscal the increase in revenue growth is attributable to a much larger increase in the average retail sales price in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
as discussed in overview above  in february the company made the decision to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was principally the result of the company s decision to i substantially reduce the purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles which carry higher gross profit margin percentages  ii purchase slightly higher priced vehicles for sale which carry lower gross profit margin percentages  iii perform repairs of more vehicles in inventory without passing on the added cost  and iv assist in the repair of more customers vehicles 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  increased

financial condition the following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the company at april   and in thousands april  assets finance receivables  net inventory property and equipment  net liabilities accounts payable and accrued liabilities revolving credit facilities historically  finance receivables have tended to grow slightly faster than revenue growth 
this has historically been due  to a large extent  to an increasing average term necessitated by increases in the average retail sales price 
in fiscal  finance receivables  net grew as compared to revenue growth of 
in fiscal  finance receivables  net grew as compared to revenue growth of 
the percentage increase in finance receivables as compared to revenues during was greater than the historical average due to several factors  including an increase in the average note term 
the average note term at april  was months  which is up from months at april  and months at april  additionally  higher interest rates on finance receivables during resulted in a higher percentage of customer payments going to interest as opposed to principle reduction 
also  our day plus past due amounts were higher in fiscal than compared to and the company had an increase in past due dollars in the less than day category based on the timing of customer payments  particularly at year end 
also  finance receivables were up due to the acquisition of dan s auto sales in lexington  kentucky in mid march the company expects the historical relationship between net finance receivable growth and revenue growth to continue in the future but in an expected range between the and experience 
in fiscal  inventory grew by as compared to revenue growth of 
inventory grew at a faster pace than revenues as a result of the company s decision to i increase the level of inventory it carries at many of its stores to facilitate sales growth  and ii increase the average inventory cost per unit 
in fiscal  the average retail sales price increased over fiscal inventory increased million during fiscal as the company made the decision to carry more inventories per store 
property and equipment  net increased million in fiscal as the company purchased real estate for a number of new stores and relocated some existing stores to purchased property 
the company also refurbished and expanded a number of existing stores to facilitate revenue growth 
as a percentage of total assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities have been fairly consistent from year to year 
borrowings on the company s revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily based upon a number of factors including i net income  ii finance receivables growth  iii capital expenditures  and iv common stock repurchases 
historically  income from continuing operations  as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facility  have funded the finance receivables growth and capital asset purchases 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the company s statements of cash flows in thousands years ended april  operating activities income from continuing operations provision for credit losses finance receivable originations finance receivable collections inventory income taxes other receivables accounts payable and accrued liabilities other total investing activities purchase of property and equipment proceeds from sale of property and equipment payment for business acquired total financing activities revolving credit facility  net purchase of common stock exercise of stock options and warrants total cash provided by used in continuing operations the company generates cash flow from income from continuing operations 
most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth 
to the extent finance receivables growth exceeds income from continuing operations  generally the company increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
the majority of the company s growth is self funded 
the company has had a tendency to lease the majority of the properties where its stores are located 
as of april   the company leased approximately of its store properties 
the company expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its stores are located 
car mart s revolving credit facilities limit distributions from car mart to the company beyond i the repayment of an intercompany loan million at april   and ii dividends equal to of car mart of arkansas net income 
at april   the company s assets excluding its million equity investment in car mart consisted of  in cash  million in other assets and a million receivable from car mart 
thus  the company is limited in the amount of dividends or other distributions it can make to its shareholders without the consent of car mart s lender 
beginning in february  car mart assumed substantially all of the operating costs of the company 
at april   the company had 
million of cash on hand and an additional million of availability under its revolving credit facilities million upon the funding of the million term loan in may see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
on a short term basis  the company s principal sources of liquidity include income from continuing operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
on a longer term basis  the company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from continuing operations and borrowings under revolving credit facilities and or fixed interest term loans 
further  while the company has no specific plans to issue debt or equity securities  the company believes  if necessary  it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities 
the company expects to use cash to i grow its finance receivables portfolio by a percentage that is larger than the percentage that its revenues grow  ii purchase property and equipment of approximately to million in the next months in connection with opening new stores and refurbishing existing stores  and iii reduce debt  to the extent excess cash is available 
in addition  from time to time the company may use cash to repurchase its common stock 
the company s revolving credit facilities mature in april the company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facilities on or before the date they mature 
the company believes it will have adequate liquidity to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual payment obligations the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of april   including renewal periods under operating leases that are reasonably assured in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt operating leases total the million of lease commitments includes million of non cancelable lease commitments under the primary lease terms  and million of lease commitments for renewal periods at the company s option that are reasonably assured 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into operating leases for approximately of its store and office facilities 
generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options 
the company uses leasing arrangements to maintain flexibility in its store locations and to preserve capital 
the company expects to continue to lease the majority of its store and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past 
for the years ended april   and rent expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
other than its operating leases  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangement that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
related finance company contingency car mart of arkansas and colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax returns  as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns 
car mart of arkansas routinely sells its finance receivables to colonial at what the company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax deduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price 
these types of transactions  based upon facts and circumstances  have been permissible under the provisions of the internal revenue code irc as described in the treasury regulations 
for financial accounting purposes  these transactions are eliminated in consolidation  and a deferred tax liability has been recorded for this timing difference 
the sale of finance receivables from car mart of arkansas to colonial provides certain legal protection for the company s finance receivables and  principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of colonial  also has the effect of reducing the company s overall effective state income tax rate by approximately basis points 
the actual interpretation of the regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter 
the company believes it satisfies the material provisions of the regulations 
failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction at the time the receivables are sold  and have the effect of increasing the company s overall effective income tax rate as well as the timing of required tax payments 
currently  the internal revenue service irs is examining the company s tax returns for fiscal and certain items in subsequent years  and in particular is focusing on whether or not the company satisfies the provisions of the treasury regulations which would entitle car mart of arkansas to a tax deduction at the time it sells its finance receivables to colonial 
the company is unable to determine at this time the amount of adjustments  if any  that may result from this examination 
the assessment of a tax deficiency by the irs could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  at least in the near term  if the company were ultimately unsuccessful in contesting any such deficiency 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses  which is discussed below 
the company s accounting policies are discussed in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses in the collection of its finance receivables 
the allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience  with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics ie  average amount financed and term  delinquency levels  collateral values  economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices 
the allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations 
although it is at least reasonably possible that events or circumstances could occur in the future that are not presently foreseen which could cause actual credit losses to be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses  the company believes that it has given appropriate consideration to all relevant factors and has made reasonable assumptions in determining the allowance for credit losses 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  except that sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under sfas r 
sfas r was originally issued with implementation required for interim and annual periods beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed the required effective date of sfas r to the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june sfas r became effective for the company on may  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method under which it will record compensation expense for all share based awards granted after the effective date 
the company has no unvested awards granted prior to may  as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for the fair value of employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method could potentially have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it is not expected to impact the company s overall financial position 
the total impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas r will also require the company to estimate forfeitures of share based payments upon grant 
historically  forfeitures have not been significant 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
seasonality the company s automobile sales and finance business is seasonal in nature 
the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales  as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
further  the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its finance receivable credit losses 
as a percentage of sales  the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to have lower credit losses averaging over the last five years  while its second and third fiscal quarters tend to have higher credit losses averaging over the last five years 
impact of inflation inflation has not historically been a significant factor impacting the company s results 
recent purchase price increases for vehicles coupled with higher interest rates on finance receivables  however  have had a negative effect on the company s gross profit percentages as the company focuses on keeping payments affordable to its customer base 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
in particular  the company has exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and the prime interest rate of its lender 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
as described below  a decrease in market interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company s financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables  variable rate revolving notes payable and a million fixed rate term loan funded in may see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables generally have remaining maturities from one to months 
the company s revolving notes payable contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates ie  the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime interest rate of its lender 
however  interest rates charged on finance receivables originated in the state of arkansas are limited to the federal primary credit rate at april  plus 
typically  the company charges interest on its arkansas loans at or near the maximum rate allowed by law 
thus  while the interest rates charged on the company s loans do not fluctuate once established  new loans originated in arkansas are set at a spread above the federal primary credit rate which does fluctuate 
at april   approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
the remaining loan portfolio carries interest rates approximating 
assuming that these percentages are held constant for future loan originations  the long term effect of decreases in the federal primary credit rate would generally have a negative effect on the profitability of the company 
this is the case because the amount of interest income lost on arkansas originated loans would likely exceed the amount of interest expense saved on the company s variable rate borrowings assuming the prime interest rate of its lender decreases by the same percentage as the decrease in the federal primary credit rate 
the initial impact within the first few months on profitability resulting from a decrease in the federal primary credit rate and the rate charged on its variable interest rate borrowings would be positive  as the immediate interest expense savings would outweigh the loss of interest income on new loan originations 
however  as the amount of new loans originated at the lower interest rate increases to an amount in excess of the amount of variable interest rate borrowings  the effect on profitability would become negative 
the table below illustrates the estimated impact that hypothetical changes in the federal primary credit rate would have on the company s continuing pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate remains in effect for two years  ii the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate results in a like increase or decrease in the rate charged on the company s variable rate borrowings  iii the principal amount of finance receivables million and variable interest rate borrowings million  and the percentage of arkansas originated finance receivables  remain constant during the periods  and iv the company s historical collection and charge off experience continues throughout the periods
