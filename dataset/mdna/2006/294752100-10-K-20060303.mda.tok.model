item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
general 
we operate as a real estate investment trust  or reit  that principally acquires  renovates  develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers located predominantly in high growth markets in the southern and northeastern united states 
our shopping centers are primarily anchored by national and regional supermarket chains and other necessity oriented retailers  such as drug stores or discount retail stores 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  comprising supermarket anchored shopping centers  seven drug store anchored shopping centers  other retail anchored shopping centers  six development parcels  and five non retail properties  as well as a non controlling interest in one unconsolidated joint venture that owns a parcel of land 
we believe we distinguish ourselves by owning and operating shopping centers anchored by supermarkets and other necessity oriented retailers in high density areas that are experiencing higher than average population growth or that provide particularly strong barriers to additional competition 
our goal is to own and operate properties containing dominant supermarket operators and a diverse tenant mix 
we believe that these characteristics combine to reduce the vulnerability of our properties to economic downturns  enhance consumer traffic through our properties and generate more stable cash flows over time 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under existing leases at our properties 

table of contents our business is generally dependent on the performance of the economy in the areas in which we own properties and the cost of financing available to fund our growth 
changes in the economic environment tend to have a direct effect on our tenants businesses and  therefore  their ability to continue to pay us rent 
the markets in which we currently own properties have continued to show signs of economic and population growth during we had a occupancy rate at december  and we experienced rental growth in the average minimum rent per square foot on lease renewals during in our core retail properties 
this growth  as well as the relatively low interest rate environment  contributed to the growth in our cash flows 
notwithstanding the current interest rate environment  the federal reserve has consistently raised interest rates over the last months and if these increases continue in  our cost of capital will be higher and will adversely affect our operating results 
we will continue to evaluate our properties for possible sales or joint ventures to recycle and redeploy capital 
however  these conditions have made it more difficult to acquire properties at what we believe to be attractive yields 
given the current market conditions  we have focused more of our efforts on redevelopments and developments that generally yield higher returns  while presenting greater risk 
we are pursuing new development opportunities and alternative mixed use projects  as well as joint ventures with respect to development projects 
overview 
we focused on acquiring land for future development activities  redeveloping existing properties  and re leasing vacant anchor space in our centers  as well as exploring strategic opportunities for our texas portfolio 
our property acquisitions during were financed using our revolving lines of credit  proceeds from the sale of properties  issuance of public debt and assumed mortgages 
in the event we consummate future acquisitions  we anticipate using similar financing sources 
however  there can be no assurances that these sources will be available to us in the future at reasonable terms or at all 
the highlights of our activity include we acquired two retail properties  two non retail buildings  and three land parcels held for future development  for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we sold four non core properties for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
we completed the development of a supermarket anchored shopping center containing  square feet of gross leasable area located in homestead  fl  and added  square feet to an existing center  started development on two supermarket anchored centers and have other significant developments and redevelopments in various stages of construction 
in february  we entered into a joint venture that acquired a acre development parcel in pasco county  florida 
we have a percent controlling interest in the venture and expect to receive an eight percent preferred return on our capital investment 
we currently expect that upon completion  the project will include office  retail and residential components 
also  in january  we entered into a joint venture that acquired a supermarket anchored shopping center located in st 
pete beach  florida 
we have a percent interest in the venture and expect to receive an eight percent preferred return on our capital investment 
upon completion  we expect the project will be a mixed use of retail and residential components 
during september of  we raised million in an offering of unsecured senior notes with a stated interest rate of and matures in october we increased the base rental rate by on lease renewals aggregating  square feet to per square foot 
we executed new leases totaling million square feet at an average rate of per square foot 

table of contents at december   we directly and indirectly owned approximately million ordinary shares in dim vastgoed nv dim 
dim is a public company organized under the laws of the netherlands the shares of which are listed on the euronext amsterdam stock exchange  and which operates as a closed end investment company owning and operating a portfolio of shopping center properties aggregating million square feet in the southeastern united states 
as of february   we had increased our ownership of dim to approximately million shares  representing approximately of its total outstanding ordinary shares 
we have committed to buy an additional  ordinary shares of dim  in september  for total consideration of  in june  we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our texas portfolio  we are currently considering a possible joint venture transaction with a strategic partner 
business uncertainties 
our long term operating cash flow is dependent on the continued occupancy of our properties  the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
the main long term threat to our business is our dependence on the viability of our anchor and other tenants 
in  occupancy declined from to from resulting mainly from the closure by winn dixie of two of its stores and our decision to terminate other tenants leases  usually providing for a lease termination payment 
general economic downturns and competition from national and regional supercenters  such as wal mart and target or other discount retailers  may also have an increasingly adverse impact on the business of our tenants by taking customers or reducing operating margins 
for example  on february   winn dixie stores  inc  an anchor tenant at of our shopping centers occupying  square feet of gross leasable area and accounting for approximately million in annualized minimum rent  filed for bankruptcy protection 
winn dixie has rejected two leases at our centers in connection with its restructuring activities and closed the stores 
it is no longer liable for the payment of rent or other charges at these centers 
the two affected stores provided for approximately  in annualized minimum rent 
moreover  the period during which winn dixie may reject leases has not yet expired  and  therefore  it may reject additional leases at our centers 
if it elects to close additional stores and terminate those leases  it would adversely affect our operating results  including funds from operations and cash flows 
in addition  we own approximately million of principal of winn dixie s senior notes bearing interest at  upon which interest is not being paid 
in light of winn dixie s bankruptcy  there is no guarantee that we will receive any additional payments or any principal payment at maturity 
we believe  however  that our general operating risks are mitigated by concentrating on high density  urban areas  leasing to the dominant supermarket operators in the markets in which we own properties and maintaining a diverse tenant mix 
other than winn dixie  we are not currently aware of any pending tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect our rental revenues 
in addition  although we have enjoyed a low interest rate environment in recent years  the increase in interest rates over the last months has had  and anticipated future increases in the coming months will have  an adverse effect on the cost of our future borrowings  including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  which are based on variable interest rates  and the million of our senior notes that we have swapped to a variable rate 
as interest rates rise  the interest we incur on these loans will increase 
notwithstanding these business uncertainties  we are optimistic that we are well positioned to take advantage of the sustained growth of the economy and that growth in rents and occupancy will mitigate increases in operating or financing costs 

table of contents short term liquidity needs 
as of december   we had  in cash and million available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities 
we have drawn an additional million during the first two months of on this facility to fund acquisitions and additional investment in dim 
our cash flow from operations was million for the year ended december  our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties  general and administrative expenses including payroll and related costs  interest expense and scheduled principal and balloon payments on our outstanding debt  million in senior notes maturing in april  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  development and redevelopment activities  quarterly dividends paid to our common stockholders and distributions made to holders of operating partnership units 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements  however  there are risks inherent in our business  including those risks described in item a risk factors  that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  and  therefore  on our ability to meet these requirements 
certain of our mortgage loans involving an aggregate principal balance of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving the company s capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
to date  no lender has notified us that it intends to accelerate its mortgage 
in the event that the mortgage holders declare defaults under the mortgage documents  we will  if required  prepay the remaining mortgage from existing resources  refinancing of such mortgages  borrowings under our other lines of credit or other sources of financing 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the violations of these prohibitions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our current development plans include development and redevelopment projects  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects is expected to be approximately million and of which million remains unfunded based on our current plans 
we intend to fund these costs from our unsecured revolving credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
we are likely to initiate other projects over the course of which have undetermined costs 
we may incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
we expect to pay for re leasing and recurring capital expenditures out of cash from operations 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will be able to retain any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met with cash generated from current operations and external sources of capital 
during  we paid million of dividends on our common stock 
the continual payment of dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of directors  our ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements 

table of contents long term liquidity needs 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development and redevelopment projects that we undertake at our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties or other companies 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through what we believe to be the most advantageous source of capital available at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities  sales of common stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs  however  there are risks inherent in our business  including those risks described in item a risk factors  that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional unsecured debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have investment grade credit ratings for our unsecured senior debt from two major rating agencies standard poor s and moody s investors service 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rates currently payable under our existing credit facilities and certain of our debt securities  would likely increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing 
the indentures under which our publicly traded debt securities are issued also contain certain restrictions on our ability to incur debt and other financial covenants 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding future contractual obligations  excluding interest  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years mortgage notes payable scheduled amortization balloon payments total mortgage obligations unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured senior notes capital leases operating leases development and redevelopment total contractual obligations million of the outstanding balance has been swapped to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears  plus 
the contractual obligations for the unsecured senior notes do not reflect this interest rate swap 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain information regarding future interest obligations on outstanding debt as of december  in thousands payments due by period interest obligations total less than year years years more than years mortgage notes unsecured senior notes unsecured revolving credit facilities total interest obligations million of the outstanding principal balance has been swapped to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears  plus 
the interest obligations for the unsecured senior notes presented above assume that the rate that was in effect at december  remains the same for this interest rate swap 
interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility is variable  these amounts assume that the weighted average interest rate remains the same as the rate at december  we have entered into employment contracts with several of our key executives 
these contracts provide for base pay  bonuses based on our results of operations  options and restricted stock grants and reimbursement of other various expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an off balance sheet joint venture and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements were as follows letters of credit totaling million have been provided as security for certain performance requirements  we have committed to fund million  based on current plans and estimates  in order to complete pending development and redevelopment projects 
these obligations  comprised principally of construction contracts  are generally due as the work is performed and are expected to be financed by our available credit facilities  we have committed to buy  in september  an additional  shares of dim vastgoed nv ordinary shares for total consideration of  and we own interests in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns a parcel of land that is held for future development or sale 
we are obligated to fund of any working capital that is required as determined jointly by us and our joint venture partner 
the current obligations are a nominal amount to pay property taxes and other carrying costs 
the joint venture currently has no outstanding debt obligations or contractual commitments and we have not guaranteed any obligations or retained any contingent interest in any assets 
we expect to fund these obligations from working capital and availability under our revolving credit facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides additional information related to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and if necessary  adjusts its estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents real estate properties and development assets 
we capitalize acquisition and construction costs  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs that are directly identifiable with a project  from pre acquisition until the time that construction is complete and the development is ready for its intended use  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
we allocate the capitalized project costs to the various components of the project based on the components relative fair values 
our cost allocation method requires the use of management estimates regarding the fair market value of each project component 
management bases its estimates on current market appraisals  comparable sales  existing sale and purchase contracts  replacement cost  historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair market values of real estate assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates and anticipated returns on a project  as well as the gain or loss on disposition of the individual project components  could vary significantly from estimated amounts 
on a periodic basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  we assess whether the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if it is probable that management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the historical net carrying value of the property 
in management s estimate of cash flows  it considers factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
in addition  the undiscounted cash flows may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by management and considers the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact the company s net income 
to the extent that impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
when assets are identified as held for sale  management estimates the sales prices  net of selling costs  of such assets 
assets that will be sold together in a single transaction are aggregated in determining if the net sales proceeds of the group are expected to be less than the net book value of the assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales prices of the assets  which have been identified for sale  are expected to be less than the net book value of the assets  an impairment charge is recorded 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties and other investments 
the assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate charge to expense 
business combinations 
we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases  costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it is probable that we will not be successful in the acquisition 
the results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
fair value is defined as the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in order to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies and properties to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we identify and estimate the fair value of the land  buildings and improvements  review the leases to determine the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any contractual or other legal rights and investigates the existence of  and estimate the fair value of  any other identifiable intangibles 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangibles 

table of contents the cost approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of the buildings  improvements and other assets 
the cost approach is based upon the current costs to develop the particular asset in that geographic location  less an allowance for physical and functional depreciation 
the assigned value for buildings and improvements is based on an as if vacant basis 
the market value approach is used as the primary method to estimate the fair value of the land 
the determination of the fair value of contractual intangibles is based on the costs incurred to originate a lease  including commissions and legal costs  excluding any new leases negotiated in connection with the purchase of a property 
in place lease values are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease and our overall relationship with each tenant 
among the factors considered in the allocation of these values include the nature of the existing relationship with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  the expectation of lease renewals  the estimated carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease up period  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
estimated carrying costs include real estate taxes  insurance  other property operating costs and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods  given the specific market conditions 
above market  below market and in place lease values are determined based on the present value using a discount rate reflecting the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases negotiated and in place at the time of acquisition and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the property or equivalent property  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of contractual intangibles is amortized over the remaining term of each lease 
other than as discussed above  we have determined that our real estate properties do not have any other significant identifiable intangibles 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangibles and the assumptions of what marketplace participants would use in making estimates of fair value include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  estimated carrying costs  estimated origination costs  lease up periods and tenant risk attributes  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired lease will continue to be used in our portfolio and discount rates used in these calculations 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may not always reflect unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur 
in making such estimates  management uses a number of sources  including appraisals or other market data  as well as  information obtained in its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities 
securities 
we have investments that consist primarily of equity and debt securities 
the equity investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value based on current market prices 
changes in the fair value of the equity investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the debt securities are recorded at cost and are classified as held to maturity  with the related discount premium amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method 
for securities classified as held to maturity  we determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary decline in value requires significant estimates and assumptions by management and requires the consideration of expected outcomes that are out of management control 
subsequent changes in estimates  assumptions used or expected outcomes could impact the determination of whether a decline in value is more than temporary and whether the effects could materially impact our financial position or net income 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security will be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down will be included in earnings that is  accounted for as a realized loss 

table of contents goodwill 
we are required to perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill  and more frequently in certain circumstances 
goodwill is no longer amortized 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the key assumptions we made to determine the fair value of our reporting units each property is considered a reporting unit under sfas no 
included a net operating income  b cash flows  and c the estimated fair value  which was based on our experience in evaluating acquisitions and market conditions 
a variance in the net operating income or discount rate could have had a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded 
management cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our tenants  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant tenants 
revenue recognition 
as lessor  we retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income is recognized over the lease term on a straight line basis 
revenue from percentage rent is recognized when tenants reported sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period when the applicable costs are incurred 
termination fees are recognized when a tenant s lease is terminated 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit quality 
if our estimate of collectibility differs from the cash received the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we do not consider ourselves to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other managing equity owner 
accordingly  we account for the one joint venture in which we do not retain unilateral control under the equity method 
we calculate the equity in income or loss earned from our unconsolidated joint ventures based on each equity owners economic ownership  which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cash flows as they would be allocated to each equity owner based on how cash flow is distributed 
generally  under the terms of the respective joint venture agreements  net ordinary cash flow is distributed to each equity owner in accordance with such owner s equity ownership percentages 

table of contents options 
the adoption on january  of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate that the impact on our results of operations of adopting sfas r in  with respect to our prior year and unvested stock option grants only  will be approximately  however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact as presented in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note  stock options  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
there is no observable market for our options 
management must make critical estimates in determining the fair value at the grant date 
variations in the assumptions will have a direct impact on our net income 
critical estimates in valuing the fair value at the grant date and the assumptions that marketplace participants would use in making estimates of fair value include expected volatility  expected dividends  risk free interest rate and expected term of the option 
management s estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may not always reflect unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur 
results of operations our consolidated results of operations often are not comparable from period to period due to the impact of property acquisitions  dispositions  developments and redevelopments 
the results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition 
a large portion of the change in our statement of operations line items is related to these changes in our property portfolio 
on february   winn dixie stores  inc  an anchor tenant in of our shopping centers occupying  square feet of gross leasable area and accounting for approximately million in annualized minimum rent  filed for bankruptcy protection 
winn dixie has closed two of its winn dixie stores in connection with its restructuring activities 
the two affected stores provided for approximately  in annualized minimum rent 
if it elects to close more or all of their other stores at our centers and terminate those leases  it would adversely affect our operating results  including funds from operations and cash flows 
in addition  we own approximately million original principal amount of winn dixie s senior notes 
since it filed for bankruptcy  winn dixie has not paid any interest payment on these notes  therefore  there is no guarantee that we will receive any additional payments or any principal payment at maturity 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed base rents  recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants and percentage rents that are based on specified percentages of tenants revenues  in each case as provided in the particular leases 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  management expenses  insurance  utilities and other expenses  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage debt  unsecured senior debt and revolving credit facilities indebtedness 
in addition  we incur substantial non cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties 
we also capitalize certain expenses  such as taxes and interest  incurred in respect of property under development or redevelopment until the property is ready for its intended use 

table of contents in june  we announced our intention to consider strategic alternatives for the properties located in texas  including a possible sale or joint venture 
the classification of the operating results for these properties in previous reporting periods were included in discontinued operations 
in december  however  we decided to consider the possibility of a joint venture with a strategic partner through which we would retain an ownership interest in and continue to manage the properties 
as a result of our potential significant continuing involvement in these properties  we are required to include the operating results of properties located in texas in our consolidated income from continuing operations 
despite such treatment  upon completion of a possible joint venture transaction  in which we would have significant influence  the results of operations of the texas properties would not be consolidated with our results  but would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the effect on results of operations for the reporting periods is presented in footnote  dispositions  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summarizes items from our audited consolidated statements of operations that we think are important in understanding our results of operations and or those items which have significantly changed in compared to in thousands for the year ended december  change total rental revenue property operating expenses rental property depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses interest expense investment income discontinued operations total rental revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in the following factors accounted for this difference properties acquired during increased rental revenue by approximately million  the full year benefited from properties acquired during which increased rental revenue by approximately million  same property rental revenue increased by approximately million in due to higher termination fees  expense recovery revenue and increases in rental rates  and the completion of development and redevelopment properties increased rental revenue by approximately million

these increases were offset by a reduction of  in professional fees related to compliance costs incurred in to implement requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of and  less in abandoned pre acquisition due diligence costs

table of contents we sold four properties and at december   have one property held for sale that qualifies for discontinued operations 
the  operating results of these properties are reflected as gain on disposal of income producing properties 
the sales of the properties produced an aggregate gain of million for the income from rental properties held for sale of million reflects a reclassification of operations for properties sold during and and the one property held for sale that qualifies as discontinued operations 
we recognized gains of million in related to the sales of properties during during  the limited partners of irt partners lp elected to convert their partnership interest for our common stock 
this conversion resulted in a decrease in the minority interest

each of the existing mortgage loans is secured by a mortgage on one or more of our properties 
certain of the mortgage loans involving an aggregate principal balance of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving our capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
to date  no lender has notified us that it intends to accelerate its mortgage 
in the event that the mortgage holders declare defaults under the mortgage documents  we will  if required  prepay the remaining mortgage from existing resources  refinancing of such mortgages  borrowings under our other lines of credit or other sources of financing 
based on discussions with various lenders  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the violations of these prohibitions will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition

the indentures under which our unsecured senior notes were issued have several covenants which limit our ability to incur debt  require us to maintain an unencumbered assets ratio above a specified level and limit our ability to consolidate  sell  lease  or convey substantially all of our assets to  or merge with any other entity 
these notes have also been guaranteed by most of our subsidiaries 
the interest rate on the senior notes is subject to a basis point increase if we do not maintain an investment grade debt rating

in addition  the facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants regarding debt levels  total liabilities  interest coverage  ebitda coverage ratios  unencumbered properties and permitted investments 
the facility also prohibits stockholder distributions in excess of of funds from operations calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending 
notwithstanding this limitation  we can make stockholder distributions to avoid income taxes on asset sales 
if a default under the facility exists  our ability to pay dividends would be limited to the amount necessary to maintain the company s status as a reit unless the default is a payment default or bankruptcy event in which case we would be prohibited from paying any dividends

table of contents we also have a million unsecured credit facility with city national bank of florida  of which there was a  outstanding balance as of december  and no outstanding balance at december  this facility also provides collateral for million in outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the availability under the various credit facilities as revised in january  was approximately million  net of outstanding balances and letters of credit 
at december   our fully diluted market capitalization totaled billion  comprising million shares of common stock and billion of net debt excluding any unamortized fair market premium discount and net of cash 
our ratio of net debt to total market capitalization was  and our ratio of net debt to gross real estate cost and securities investments was 
our debt level could subject us to various risks  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and the risk that the resulting reduced financial flexibility could inhibit our ability to develop or improve our rental properties  withstand downturns in our rental income or take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  because we currently anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity  it is expected that it will be necessary to refinance the majority of our debt 
accordingly  there is a risk that such indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our current indebtedness

million of the outstanding balance has been swapped to a floating interest rate based on the month libor in arrears  plus 
the indicated rate and weighted average rate for the unsecured senior notes do not reflect this interest rate swap

table of contents secured debt unsecured debt year due scheduled amortization balloon payments revolving credit facilities senior notes total thereafter total excludes the fair value of the interest rate swap 
we may not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these balloon amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this indebtedness either through additional mortgage financing secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
our results of operations could be affected if the cost of new debt is greater or lesser than the cost of the maturing debt 
if new financing is not available  we could be required to sell assets and our business would be adversely affected 
development activity 
as of december   we had significant development and redevelopment projects underway or in the planning stage totaling approximately million of asset value which we anticipate will require million of additional investment to complete based on current plans and estimates 
the more significant of these include the development of two supermarket anchored shopping centers  in mcdonough  georgia and huntsville  alabama  shops at skylake in north miami beach  florida  where we are in the process of adding  square feet of additional retail space  belfair towne village in bluffton  south carolina  where we are adding  square feet of retail space  st

these developments and redevelopments are scheduled for completion starting early 
table of contents shelf registration 
we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission  which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statement provides us additional flexibility in accessing capital markets to fund future growth and for general corporate purposes 
equity 
for the year ended december   we issued  shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options at prices ranging from to per share 
we also issued million shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share pursuant to our divided reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
as of december   we have million shares remaining for sale under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
future capital requirements 
we believe  based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations  that our existing financial arrangements  together with cash generated from our operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for a period of at least twelve months 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing financing arrangements prove to be insufficient to fund our expansion and development efforts or to the extent we discover suitable acquisition targets the purchase price of which exceeds our existing liquidity  we would be required to seek additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all  and any future equity financing could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
distributions 
we believe that we currently qualify  and intend to continue to qualify in the future  as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
as distributions have exceeded taxable income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made 
while we intend to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders  we also will reserve such amounts of cash flow as we consider necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of our real estate and other corporate purposes while still maintaining our qualification as a reit 
our cash distributions for the year ended december  were million 
new accounting standards in march  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments 
the accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after june  in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp eitf 
fsp eitf delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph of eitf and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and we continued to apply relevant other than temporary guidance  as provided for in fsp eitf during fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of the guidance of fsp fas and fas will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
this standard will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award

public companies with calendar year ends would be required to adopt the provision of the standard effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption on january  of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
management has elected to apply the modified prospective transition method to all past awards outstanding and unvested as of the date of adoption 
we estimate that the impact of adopting sfas r in on our prior year and unvested stock option grants only will be approximately  however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact as presented in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note  stock options  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in december of  the fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
statement amends opinion by eliminating the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement shall be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this pronouncement is prospective and has no effect on our financial position or results of operations as of december  in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred  if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated

in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error correction sfas  which replaces apb opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  on the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effects of this proposed standard  but we do not expect it to materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf regarding eitf no 
 determining the amortization period of leasehold improvements 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination  or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease  be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or term that includes renewals that has been reasonably assured at the date of the business combination 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june  eitf did not impact our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning facilities at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we require that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in material compliance with current laws and regulations and we have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
several properties in our portfolio will require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation 
however  we have environmental insurance policies covering all of our properties 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity or operations 
inflation and recession considerations most of our leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
a small number of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which sales generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of our existing tenants to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
supermarkets  drugstores and other anchor tenants that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items anchor our existing properties 
these types of tenants  in our experience  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk interest rate risk 
the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates can affect our net income and cash flows 
as changes in market conditions occur and interest rates increase or decrease  interest expense on the variable component of our debt will move in the same direction 
we intend to utilize variable rate indebtedness available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities in order to initially fund future acquisitions  development costs and for other operating needs 
with respect to our fixed rate mortgage notes and fixed rate senior unsecured notes  changes in interest rates generally do not affect our interest expense as these notes are predominantly at fixed rates for extended terms 
because we have the intent to hold our existing fixed rate notes either to maturity or until the sale of the associated property  these fixed rate notes do not pose an interest rate risk to our results of operations or our working capital position  only upon the refinancing of that mortgage 
our possible risk is from increases in long term interest rates that may occur over a period of several years  as this may decrease the overall value of its real estate 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt  including million of fixed rate borrowings that we have converted to floating rate borrowings through the use of hedging agreements 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december   in relation to our billion of outstanding debt  billion of total assets and billion total equity market capitalization as of that date 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at approximately million including the million of fixed rate debt converted to floating rate debt through the use of hedging agreements  the balance as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt is million  which includes the mortgage notes and fixed rate portion of senior unsecured notes payable excluding the unamortized premium 
if interest rates increase by  the fair value of our total fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
this assumes that our total outstanding fixed rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december  hedging 
to manage  or hedge  our exposure to interest rate risk  we follow established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we require that the hedges or derivative financial instruments be effective in managing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential to qualify for hedge accounting 
hedges that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as such at the inception of the contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  resulting in some ineffectiveness  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be included in earnings 
additionally  any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market each period and would be charged to operations 
we are exposed to credit risk  in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the hedge agreements 
we believe that we mitigate our credit risk by entering into these agreements with major financial institutions 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are included in interest expense as incurred or earned 
during  we entered into a million notional principal variable rate interest swap with an estimated fair value of million as of december  this swap converted fixed rate debt to variable rate based on the month libor in arrears plus  and matures april  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts which fix the treasury rate for an anticipated financing in early at a weighted average interest rate of per annum on notional amounts aggregating million which expire in march the company entered into the interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the treasury rate in contemplation of obtaining fixed rate financing 
during  we unwound million of the swaps for total settlement proceeds to us of million 
the estimated fair value of our derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 

table of contents other market risks as of december   we had no material exposure to any other market risks including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk 
for purposes of the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  we have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments at december  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts as of december   future estimates of fair value and the amounts which may be paid or realized in the future may differ significantly from amounts presented
