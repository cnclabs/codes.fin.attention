item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook below 
in addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity  the company also holds intellectual property in the form of trademarks on products such as enfamil 
trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product  but are considered to have marketing value 
worldwide  all of the company s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance 
trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
specific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country 
the following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant company sales united states a company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the united states must file a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the fda 
the type of application filed depends on whether the drug is a chemical a small molecule or a biological product a large molecule 
if the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical  the company files a nda 
if the medicine is a biological product  a bla is filed 
the type of application filed affects regulatory exclusivity rights 
a competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the united states must file an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda 
in the anda  the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic substitute and the approved nda drug 
the anda relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its nda 
medicines approved under an nda can receive several types of regulatory data protection 
an innovative chemical pharmaceutical also known as a new chemical entity is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the us  during which an anda cannot be filed with the fda 
if an innovator s patent is challenged  as described below  the generic manufacturer may file its anda after the fourth year of the five year data protection period 
a pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an nda  but is approved in a new formulation or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical trials  receives three years of data protection 
finally  an nda that is designated as an orphan drug  which is a drug that gains an indication for treatment of a condition that occurs only rarely in the united states  can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication 
during this time period neither ndas nor andas for the same drug product can be approved for the same orphan use 
because a significant portion of patent life can be lost during the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval  the innovator can extend one patent to compensate the innovator for the lost patent term  at least in part 
more specifically  the innovator may identify one patent  which claims the product or its approved method of use  and  depending on a number of factors  may extend the expiration date of that patent 
there are two limits to these extensions 
first  the maximum term a patent can be extended is years  and second  the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than years from the date of nda approval 
a company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical trials are conducted at the written request of the fda to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients  and submission to the fda is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity 
this six month period extends most forms of exclusivity patent and regulatory that are listed with the fda at the time the studies are completed and submitted to the fda 
currently  generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under us law 
however  the law could change in the future 
even in the absence of new legislation  the fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 
competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data  and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing  which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
beyond the minimum period of regulatory exclusivity provided by us law  many but not all innovative drugs are also covered by patents held by the nda sponsor 
the innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the fda in what is commonly known as the orange book 
absent a successful patent challenge  the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator s listed patents expire 
however  after the innovator has marketed its product for four years  a generic manufacturer may file an anda and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the orange book under an innovator s nda is either invalid or not infringed 
this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification 
the innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer 
if one or more of the nda listed patents are successfully challenged  or if the innovator chooses not to sue  the first filer of a paragraph iv certification or first filers if more than one generic qualifies may be entitled to a day period of market exclusivity as against all other generic manufacturers 
from time to time andas  including paragraph iv certifications  are filed with respect to certain of the company s products 
the company evaluates these andas on a case by case basis and  where warranted  files suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patent rights 
several recent developments in the united states have increased the likelihood of generic challenges to innovators intellectual property  and thus  increased the risk of loss of innovators market exclusivity 
first  generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products
