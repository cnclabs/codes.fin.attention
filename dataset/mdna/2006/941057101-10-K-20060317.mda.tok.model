item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
we were founded by our chairman of the board of directors in we operate in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  mississippi  tennessee  georgia and florida  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  recycling facilities and landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  percentages of our total revenue attributable to services provided are as follows year ended december  collection residential commercial industrial disposal and transfer recycling service recycled commodity sales other total service revenue from through december   we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations  with being acquired in  nine being acquired in and six being acquired in ninety four of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
during the year ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring the presentation of the acquired company s historical or the combined company s pro forma financial statements 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase our revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 

table of contents executive summary in we continued to focus on our initiatives for achieving positive results and improving our performance 
they are strengthening our competitive position in desired markets  internalizing more of our waste volume  increasing revenues from our landfill operations  and employing best practices to deliver exceptional service 
our performance for was impacted by the business climate we operate within  which saw improving  but still relatively soft economic conditions in many of the secondary markets we serve  increased service delivery costs primarily due to higher fuel prices and costs to transfer waste  intense competitive pressures on pricing  and increased compliance costs primarily related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of despite these challenges  our revenues increased to million and our revenues per man hour improved by nearly 
we have continued to look for and find ways to improve our efficiency and productivity 
in  we rerouted for efficiency over  routes and plan on performing over  route reviews in in addition  we have increased employee training and centered our efforts on fleet maintenance  data management  and customer pricing 
in  we believe these efforts will better position our company as the economy continues its recovery 
service revenue growth of was comprised of internal growth and of net acquisition growth 
of that internal growth  approximately was due to pricing 
we implemented a pricing strategy to adjust pricing on accounts that were not meeting standards and  in some cases  we chose to give up accounts that refused reasonable price increases 
volume increases contributed to our internal growth for this growth was primarily the result of higher seasonal industrial volume  increased landfill tonnage  and strong national accounts growth for the year 
fuel surcharges contributed additional growth of in as we continued to adjust pricing to cover certain inflationary costs  as discussed below 
acquisition growth was during  in which we completed business acquisitions and three business dispositions  representing net annualized acquired revenues of million 
all acquisitions in were tuck ins and a continuation of our plan to expand in selected markets in order to achieve better route density and leverage our overhead cost structure 
we have experienced  as have others in our industry sector  increased operating costs which include higher fuel costs  third party disposal fees  and transfer costs 
most significantly  our total fuel costs increased approximately in we implemented a fuel surcharge program based upon a regional fuel index  which is designed to recover some of the fuel cost increases 
our capital expenditures of approximately million increased by million over the prior year  including million primarily related to cell construction at our landfills 
in  we paid million in dividends compared to million paid in despite higher capital spending and increased dividend payments  our debt to total capitalization ratio of at december  was lower than the prior year ratio of 
we are working to amend and extend our million revolving credit facility  currently scheduled to mature in february  to provide sufficient capital in combination with our cash flow from operating activities to fund our near term growth strategy and capital expenditures 
we expect this amendment and extension of our existing credit facility to be completed in the first quarter of general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized during the month in 
table of contents which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts provide consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 
our ability to pass on cost increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with nine counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned or operated landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the disposal compactors and containers that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects that meet stringent capitalization criteria 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations

total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to increases in residential collection revenue  million  commercial collection revenue  million  and disposal transfer revenue  million 
our service revenue growth of was comprised of of net acquisition growth and of internal growth 
we were more effective in initiating price increases in due to a disciplined approach towards customer profitability analysis and utilizing our pricing optimization software 
pricing increased  and energy related surcharges increased  versus we have implemented a fuel surcharge program based upon a regional fuel index  which is designed to recover some increases in fuel costs 
internal volume was up  primarily in the areas of residential  commercial  and disposal transfer

other intangible asset amortization expense increased approximately million due to amortization of customer lists 
gain on sale of collection and hauling operations 
we recognized a gain on sale of collection and hauling operations totaling approximately million in from the sale of operations in mississippi and tennessee 
this event occurred prior to the effective date of emerging issues task force issue no 
which generally requires such dispositions to be shown as a component of discontinued operations 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
gain on sale of property and equipment and other assets

the remaining million in and million in related to impairment of fixed assets temporarily taken out of service 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased in primarily due to interest capitalized in relation to ongoing construction projects  partially offset by increased borrowings to fund acquisitions as well as a higher average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in due primarily to higher pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased to in from a rate of in due primarily to an increase in our estimated deferred income tax liabilities 
discontinued operations 
net income from discontinued operations declined in due to poorer performing operations in a portion of the operations discontinued in became operational in late the higher losses in were partially offset by the gain recognized upon disposition of the assets of the discontinued operations 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the changes explained above  most notably from our increased revenue 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in of this decrease  million was related to decreased fleet depreciation due to fewer power units and maturity of depreciable lives on some assets 
landfill site and cell amortization expense was million higher due to increased landfill tonnage 
closure post closure amortization costs were million lower in due primarily to expansion permits obtained for our sampson facility  previously deemed at airspace capacity 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective january   landfill assets are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense as airspace is consumed over the life of the specific final capping event or the life of the landfill for closure and post closure 
gain on sale of collection and hauling operations 
we recognized a gain on sale of collection and hauling operations totaling approximately million in from the sale of operations in mississippi and tennessee 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately million on divestiture of assets in certain markets that did not meet our profitability goals 

table of contents asset impairment 
we recognized a million impairment charge in related to our determination that certain landfill permitting efforts had a less than probable chance of success 
the remaining million related to impairment of fixed assets temporarily taken out of service

discontinued operations 
the effect of operations discontinued in has been shown in the and results of operations 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
as a result  for the year ended december   we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million net of tax benefit of million 
for a discussion of sfas no 
 see critical accounting policies 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the changes explained above  most notably  million higher gains on disposal of operations  increased sales revenue  and a lower effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was a negative million and a negative million at december  the negative amounts were primarily the result of using cash generated from operations for capital expenditures and acquisitions  both long term assets 
our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in we have a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which bank of america acts as agent 
this credit facility provides up to million through february we are in the process of amending and extending this credit facility through september and believe it will be finalized by the end of the first quarter of the company also has a term loan facility with prudential 
the prudential term loan facility consists of three term loans of million each 
virtually all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the revolver 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with bank of america  prudential shares in the collateral pledged under the revolver 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the revolver bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a bank of america base rate or at the eurodollar rate libor plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on our leverage ratio  from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor rate borrowings 
the revolver requires us to maintain financial covenants and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits our capital expenditures and indebtedness 
it also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  and december  as of december   an aggregate of approximately million was outstanding under the revolver  with an average interest rate on outstanding borrowings of approximately 
availability under this facility was approximately million as of december  after consideration of outstanding letters of credit 
prior to  we had fully drawn upon our three million term facilities with prudential 
principal repayments are due annually on each of the million term facilities 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial covenants  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limit our capital expenditures and indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  and december  interest on the three prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the three facilities of  and  respectively 

table of contents on september   we entered into a million income tax exempt variable rate bond with sampson county  north carolina for the funding of expansion at our landfill in that county 
this bond payable was in addition to our existing million sampson facility 
both bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by wachovia bank na as a participating lender under our bank of america syndication 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under both sampson facilities was approximately and at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt expected landfill liabilities capital expenditures operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations includes amounts outstanding as of december  of million under our revolver  million under the prudential term facilities  and million under the sampson bond facilities 
our revolver allows us to borrow up to million provided we are in compliance with the facility s loan covenants 
includes projected interest assuming the various debt facilities are held to maturity at current rates 
as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into various interest rate swaps which fixed the interest rate for a portion of our debt through additionally  we have entered into commodity swap contracts to hedge our recycling revenue received for old corrugated cardboard 
the commodity swap contracts have a term of three years 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was an asset of approximately million 
the fair values of the commodity swap contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as an asset of approximately million as of december  the above table does not include any obligations for these interest rate swaps 
liabilities are based on current costs and include capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
these costs represent the expected landfill liabilities we will incur for final capping  closure and post closure for the airspace consumed to date 
we will recognize additional liabilities for these types of costs as airspace is consumed in each landfill 
we use financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees 
the two largest uses of financial surety bonds are for municipal contract performance guarantees and landfill closure and post closure financial assurance required under applicable environmental regulations 
environmental regulations require demonstrated financial assurance to meet closure and post closure requirements for landfills 
in addition to surety bonds  these requirements may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments  including insurance and letters of credit 

table of contents amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year to years over years in thousands standby letters of credit performance bonds total commercial commitments net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash adjustments eg depreciation and amortization  etc 
of million and net changes in assets liabilities of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions  offset by million provided from the sale of collection and hauling operations  and million was used for capital expenditures  of which million was for landfill expansion  with the balance primarily for investments in equipment  consisting primarily of trucks and containers 
cash inflows from investing activities included million received from the sale of property and equipment and other assets 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were million  compared to million in we currently expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million to million 
in  million of the expected capital expenditures are earmarked for landfill site and cell construction and million for landfill equipment and related facilities 
we have funded and expect to fund our capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any such newly acquired disposal facilities 
the amount of these expenditures cannot be currently determined because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses  to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock  and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities through borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care of disposal facilities that we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the epa s subtitle d regulations 
our estimate of capping  final closure of our operating facilities  and post closure monitoring costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for capping  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs  there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  which primarily included net borrowings of long term debt including capital leases of million  offset by dividends paid of million 
additionally  we received approximately million from stock option exercises 
cash flows from operations discontinued in have not been presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
included in our net cash used in investing activities is approximately million of cash pertaining to proceeds received from sale of discontinued operations 
the impact of these dispositions on prior year operating  financing  and other investing activities is insignificant 

table of contents at december   we had approximately million of long term and short term borrowings outstanding including capital leases and approximately million in letters of credit including performance bonds 
the ratio of our total debt including capital leases to total capitalization was at december   compared to as of december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a franchise agreement with camden county  north carolina  effective november  see item legal proceedings 
pursuant to the franchise agreement  we have agreed to indemnify the county  its officers  employees and agents  which would include the county commissioners  against all claims arising out of the franchise agreement 
as a result  we are liable for the expenses of  and any damages or other awards ultimately determined against  those defendants 
this arrangement has not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements for discussion of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the future allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical collection trends  type of customer  such as municipal or non municipal  the age of the outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
one customer  solid waste management authority of crisp county  represented approximately million and million of the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and  respectively 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more discussion regarding the authority 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
self insurance reserves we assume the risks for medical  dental  workers compensation  and casualty insurance exposures up to certain loss thresholds set forth in separate insurance contracts 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from third party experts 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 

table of contents adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the effect of applying the provisions of sfas no 
was a reduction in income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  of approximately million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
effective january   our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure  as well as landfill final capping  changed as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
does not change the basic landfill accounting that we and others in the industry have followed historically 
through december   the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed 
for further explanation  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
a brief explanation of final capping  closure and post closure is as follows final capping costs we are required to estimate the cost of each final capping event which involves covering the landfill with a flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liner  compacted soil layers and topsoil and provide drainage for the areas of the landfill where total airspace capacity has been consumed 
the estimates also consider when these costs would be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
for each final capping event we quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs and amortize it over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs closure costs include the last final capping event  the construction of the methane gas collection system  demobilization and routine maintenance costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
post closure activities  which include final landfill retirement activities once regulatory requirements are met  consist of routine maintenance of the landfill after it has closed  monitoring the ground and surface water  gas emissions and air quality 
estimates for future closure and post closure costs are based on costs that would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changes to legal and regulatory requirements makes our estimates and assumptions uncertain 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from closure and post closure obligations using our historical landfill accounting practices 
we amortize landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event covers 
we perform engineering studies using third party experts at least annually to estimate our remaining airspace capacity 
landfill accounting we have material financial commitments for final capping  closure and post closure obligations with respect to our landfills 
we develop our estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations using input from our third party engineers and internal accounting 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
absent quoted market prices  the estimate of fair value should be based on the best available information  including the results of present value techniques in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  or sfac  no 
 using cash flow and present value in accounting measurements 
in general  we rely on third parties to fulfill most of our obligations for final capping  closure and post closure 
accordingly  the fair market value of these obligations is based upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work 
we intend to perform some of these capping  closure and post closure obligations using internal resources 
where internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation  we have added a profit margin onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their fair market value as required by sfas no 
when we then perform these services internally  the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period earned 
sfac no 
further states that an estimate of fair value should include the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the uncertainties in cash flows 
however  when utilizing discounted cash flow techniques  reliable estimates of market premiums may not be obtainable 
in this situation  sfac no 
indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk premium in 
table of contents the determination of expected cash flows 
in the waste industry  there is not an active market that can be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities as there is no market that exists for selling the responsibility for final capping  closure and post closure obligations independent of selling the landfill in its entirety 
accordingly  we believe that it is not possible to develop a methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have excluded a market risk premium from our determination of expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfac no 
once we have determined the estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations  we then inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value 
we are currently inflating these costs in current dollars until expected time of payment using an inflation rate of and are discounting these costs to present value using a credit adjusted  risk free discount rate between and 
the credit adjusted  risk free rate is based on the risk free interest rate adjusted for our credit standing 
management reviews these estimates at least once per year 
significant changes in future final capping  closure and post closure cost estimates and inflation rates typically result in both a current adjustment to the recorded liability and corresponding adjustment to the landfill asset  based on the landfill s capacity that has been consumed  and a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
any change related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill asset is then recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
changes in our credit adjusted  risk free rate do not change recorded liabilities  but subsequently recognized obligations are measured using the revised credit adjusted risk free rate 
we record the estimated fair value of final capping  closure and post closure obligations for our landfills based on the landfills capacity that has been consumed through the current period 
this liability and corresponding asset is accrued on a per ton basis 
the estimated fair value of each final capping event will be fully accrued when the tons associated with such capping event have been disposed in the landfill 
additionally  the estimated fair value of total final capping  closure and post closure costs will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
closure and post closure accruals consider estimates for methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste  which is generally expected to be for a period of up to years after final site closure 
daily maintenance activities  which include many of these costs  are incurred during the operating life of the landfill and are expensed as incurred 
daily maintenance activities include leachate disposal  surface water  groundwater  and methane gas monitoring and maintenance  other pollution control activities  mowing and fertilizing the landfill cap  fence and road maintenance  and third party inspection and reporting costs 
for purchased disposal sites  we assess and record present value based final capping  closure and post closure obligations at the time we assume such responsibilities 
such liabilities are based on the estimated final capping  closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace consumed related to such obligations as of the date we assumed the responsibility 
thereafter  we account for the landfill and related final capping  closure and post closure obligations consistent with the policy described above 
interest accretion on final capping  closure and post closure obligations is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as final capping  closure and post closure expense  which is included in operating costs on the income statement 
in the united states  the closure and post closure obligations are established by the environmental protection agency s subtitles c and d regulations  as implemented and applied on a state by state basis 
the costs to comply with these obligations could increase in the future as a result of legislation or regulation 
we routinely review our investment in operating landfills to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate total landfill closure and post closure costs of approximately million for the airspace consumed to date 
our estimate of these costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we had accrued approximately million for such projected costs as of december  and subsequently paid approximately million in we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we utilize cash flow hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to fluctuation in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
the fair values of all derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
our derivative instruments generally qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  criteria must be met  including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 
allocation of acquisition purchase price acquisition purchase price is allocated to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
independent specialists are utilized to assist management in the determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets 
we accrue the payment of contingent purchase price if the events surrounding the contingency are deemed assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
the purchase price allocations are considered preliminary until we are no longer waiting for information that we have arranged to obtain and that is known to be available or obtainable 
although the time required to obtain the necessary information will vary with circumstances specific to an individual acquisition  the allocation period for finalizing purchase price allocations generally does not exceed one year from the consummation of a business combination 
we often consummate single acquisitions of solid waste collection or disposal operations 
for each separately identified solid waste collection or disposal operation acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation based on our relative fair value 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each solid waste collection or disposal operation based on our estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either remitted or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
in  we completed an exchange transaction in which we acquired operations of another solid waste company in georgia for operations in tennessee and mississippi  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in  we completed an exchange transaction in which we acquired operations of another solid waste company in georgia for operations in the same region  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued amortization of goodwill effective january  on an ongoing basis  we perform an annual impairment test 
at least quarterly  we also analyze whether an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce its enterprise fair value below its carrying amount and  if necessary  will perform a goodwill impairment test between annual dates 
impairment adjustment after adoption  if any  will be recognized as an operating expense 
we adopted july as our annual assessment date 
we completed our annual impairment test as of july  in the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment on a market by market basis whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the projected future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis attributable to each market would be compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets including an allocation of goodwill  if appropriate of that market 
if an impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the asset 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of such lives 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk quantitative disclosures 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective january  to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and designated the qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the agreement  the interest rate swap hedged notional debt values of million with a fixed rate of 
the agreement expired november in march  we entered into additional interest rate swaps to hedge notional debt values of million and million  respectively 
these swaps are effective for the period november through february with fixed rates of 
our results of operations are impacted by fluctuations in commodity pricing 
to reduce our risk to market fluctuations  we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge our recycling revenue received for old corrugated cardboard  or occ 
the notional amounts hedged under these agreements represent approximately of our current occ volume 
we have used heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuation in diesel fuel oil prices 
to date  such agreements have not been significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
on december   we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective january   to cap our exposure on million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon 
the hedge coverage represented approximately of our first quarter diesel fuel requirements  and expired on march  in november  we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective december   to cap our exposure on million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon through april the hedge coverage represents approximately of our diesel fuel requirements for this period 
we currently use approximately million gallons of fuel per year 
at this rate of consumption  a cost change of per gallon would have a  impact on our annual operating income  prior to any recoveries from fuel surcharges 
the following table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
fair values have been determined based on our incremental borrowing rate as of december  thereafter total carrying value total fair value in thousands fixed rate variable rate 
table of contents qualitative disclosures 
our primary exposure relates to interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
