item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding our plans  beliefs or current expectations  including those plans  beliefs and expectations of our officers and directors with respect to  among other things  the development of markets for our products  and the adequacy of our cash balances and liquidity to meet future operating needs 
important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements are listed above in part i  item a 
risk factors 
introduction we generate revenue from two principal activities research  development and application engineering services that are paid for by our customers  and the sale of motors  generators and electronic controls 
the sources of engineering revenue typically vary from year to year and individual projects may vary substantially in their periods of performance and aggregate dollar value 
our product sales consist of both prototype low volume sales  which are generally sold to a broad range of customers  and annually recurring higher volume production for two principal customers during the fiscal year ended march  invacare corporation and keith products  inc revenue from funded engineering activities for the fiscal year ended march  rose to million versus million last fiscal year and declined versus the million for the fiscal year ended march  product sales revenue for the fiscal year ended march  declined to million versus million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
in june  we completed a private placement of our common stock to two institutional investors  which generated net cash proceeds of million 
we expect to use our available cash balances to fund our business strategy to invest in selective customer projects that we believe will result in volume production and to expand our production engineering and business development groups in anticipation of the continued emergence of the market for hybrid electric vehicles 
hybrid electric vehicles require electric motors and generators of the type we design and manufacture  and we intend to aggressively pursue both this emerging market as well as conventional markets where electric motors and generators are currently in use 
although we allocated greater engineering resources to internally funded research and development and production engineering activities  our revenue from funded engineering activities increased by approximately percent to million this fiscal year versus last fiscal year due principally to improved productivity and a strong order backlog 
expenditures on production engineering activities for the fiscal year rose to million  versus million and zero  in each of the preceding two fiscal years reflecting continuing implementation of our business strategy 
the decrease in product sales revenue for the fiscal year is due to decreased shipments of production wheelchair motors offset by increased low volume prototype sales 
production of wheelchair motors for newly manufactured wheelchairs ceased in november  however  we expect to produce field service units for the foreseeable future 
in november we announced that we had received an order for  vehicle auxiliary motors from a new customer 
product shipments under this order commenced in march  since the launch of production we have received orders for an additional  units deliverable in fiscal as a result we expect product shipments to grow substantially throughout fiscal  which we expect will lead to substantial increases in product revenue  improved gross profit margin  and lower levels of operating losses 
loss from continuing operations for the current fiscal year rose to million  or per common share  versus million  or per common share last fiscal year and million  or per common share  for the preceding fiscal year 
the increase in losses versus last fiscal year is primarily attributable to our growing investment in production engineering activities research and development activities and higher levels of selling  general and administrative expense 
the increase in losses versus the fiscal year ended march   is generally attributable to declining product revenue  lower gross profit margins and increased investments in production engineering activities 
in may  we divested a contract electronics manufacturing business 
operating losses from this business for all periods presented have been reclassified to discontinued operations and contributed million  or nil per common share  million  or nil per common share  and million  or per common share  to our consolidated net loss for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe our existing cash and short term investments  which amounted to approximately million at fiscal year end  will be adequate to fund our business strategy described above  as well as the launch of new production products over the next several years 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at march  were  and working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was  compared with  and  respectively  at march  the increase in cash and short term investments and working capital is primarily attributable to proceeds from a private placement completed in june  which resulted in cash proceeds  net of placement costs  of  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and underwriter warrants which totaled  less reductions attributable to operating losses  higher levels of prepaid and other current assets  payments on trade accounts payable and debt  and investments in property and equipment  and cash used in discontinued operations 
accounts receivable decreased  to  at march  from  at march  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales and improved collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fiscal year ended march  a customer with an outstanding account receivable balance filed for bankruptcy protection resulting in a charge to bad debt expense of  despite the occurrence of this event  substantially all of our customers are large well established companies of high credit quality 
accordingly  we have not established an allowance for bad debts at march  and similarly  no allowance for bad debts was deemed necessary at march  costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased  to  at march  versus  at march  the increase is due to less favorable billing terms on contracts in process at march  versus march  estimated earnings on contracts in process increased to  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  compared to estimated earnings on contracts in process of  or percent of contracts in process of  at march  the increase in estimated margins on contracts in process is attributable to lower levels of anticipated cost overruns on engineering projects 
inventories decreased  to  at march  principally due to lower levels of raw material  work in process and finished goods inventories which decreased   and  respectively 
the decrease in raw materials is due to the cessation of production of new wheelchair propulsion motors in november the decrease in work in process inventories is attributable to lower production levels of wheelchair propulsion motors and lower production levels of low volume motors and controllers 
the decrease in finished goods inventories is attributable to reduced production levels for low volume motors and controllers at the end of the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year end 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to  at march  from  at march  primarily due to higher levels of prepaid software costs at the end of the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year end 
we invested  for the acquisition of property and equipment during the fiscal year compared to  last fiscal year 
the increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to purchases of warehousing and manufacturing equipment associated with the reconfiguration of our manufacturing floor space and the launch of a new product in march accounts payable decreased  to  at march  from  at march   primarily due to a contraction in payment terms for certain vendors  and the cessation of production of new wheelchair motors 
other current liabilities increased  to  at march  from  at march  the increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of accrued professional fees  accrued payroll  employee benefits  and property taxes 
current portion of long term debt decreased  to  at march  from  at march  reflecting scheduled principal repayments and a principal prepayment on the mortgage debt for our frederick  colorado facility 
liabilities and commitments of discontinued operations were  at march  compared to  at march  similarly  long term liabilities and commitments of discontinued operations was zero at march  compared to  at march  the decrease is attributable to a revision in our estimate of potential future obligations under our master lease on the facility previously occupied by our discontinued contract electronics business 
see also results of discontinued operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased  to  at march  from  at march  reflecting increased levels of billings on engineering contracts in process at the end of the fiscal year ended march  in advance of the performance of the associated work versus the prior fiscal year 
long term debt  less current portion decreased  to  at march  from  at march  reflecting scheduled principal repayments and a principal prepayment on the mortgage debt for our frederick  colorado facility 
long term deferred compensation under executive employment agreements increased to  from zero at march  reflecting our estimate of the potential liability for future severance payments under these contracts as of march  common stock and additional paid in capital increased to  and  respectively  at march  compared to  and  at march  the increases were primarily attributable to completion of a private placement of common stock to two institutional investors and the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
net cash proceeds to the company from these activities totaled  results of continuing operations continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march   resulted in a loss of  or per common share  compared to a loss from continuing operations of  or per common share  and  or per common share  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year loss from continuing operations is primarily attributable to higher expenditures for production engineering activities  and selling  general and administrative expenses  and the inclusion in the fiscal year ended march  of gain on sale of our taiwan joint venture of  or nil per common share  offset by higher interest income in the current year 
revenue from contract services increased  or percent  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase is primarily attributable to higher staff utilization on revenue generating programs versus the fiscal year ended march  revenue from contract services decreased  or percent  for the year ended march  compared to revenue for the year ended march  the decrease was attributable to lower staff utilization on revenue generating programs due to cost overruns on certain engineering projects and the application of certain engineering personnel that would typically be billed to revenue generating customer programs to internally funded production engineering activities 
product sales this fiscal year decreased percent to  compared to  for the year ended march  product sales revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased percent to  from  for the year ended march  power products segment revenue for the year ended march  decreased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to decreased shipments of wheelchair propulsion motors 
power products segment revenue for the year ended march  decreased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to decreased shipments of wheelchair propulsion motors 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to increased shipments of low volume prototype controllers 
technology segment product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or percent  to  compared to  for fiscal year ended march  due to increased shipments of propulsion systems for hybrid electric bus programs and the hybrid electric unmanned ground combat vehicle program 
gross profit margins for the fiscal year decreased to percent compared to and percent for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  primarily due to a decrease in gross profit margins on product sales for the current year  and a decrease in gross profit margins on contract services for the fiscal year ended march  gross profit on contract services was percent this fiscal year compared to a negative and percent for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in contract services margins for the current fiscal year versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to fewer cost overruns on engineering contracts this year versus the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in contract services margins for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to decreased overhead absorption and cost overruns on certain engineering contracts in fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 
gross profit margin on product sales this fiscal year was percent compared to percent and percent in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in margins on product sales for this fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year resulted from decreased overhead absorption associated with lower revenue levels in our power products segment 
the increase in margins on product sales for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is attributable to a more favorable product mix 
research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to higher levels of work applied to cost share type contracts and internally funded programs 
the decrease in research and development expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the completion of an internally funded development of a new microprocessor platform for our power electronic controls 
production engineering costs were  for the fiscal year ended march  versus  and zero for the prior two fiscal years 
the increase is attributable to our strategy to increase our manufacturing capability and infrastructure  and consists primarily of salary and overhead costs for newly hired manufacturing management  engineering and staff personnel 
selling  general and administrative expense this fiscal year was  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase for this fiscal year versus last fiscal year is primarily attributable to deferred compensation expense associated with executive employment agreements  higher levels of audit expenses associated with implementation of the sarbanes oxley act  selling expenses  and the write down of a receivable from a customer who filed for bankruptcy protection 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  versus the fiscal year ended march  is primarily attributable to lower insurance premium costs 
impairment of long lived assets for the fiscal year ended march  of  is primarily attributable to the impairment and disposal of obsolete equipment and abandoned patent applications 
the impairment of long lived assets for the fiscal years ended march  and march  were  and  respectively  and are attributable to the write down of costs associated with abandoned patent applications 
interest income rose to  for the current fiscal year compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to higher levels of invested cash and higher yields on invested balances during the fiscal year versus the two prior fiscal years 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended march  compared to  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to lower average mortgage borrowings outstanding throughout the fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
results of discontinued operations in january  we committed to a plan to exit our contract electronics manufacturing business whose results were reported as the electronic products segment 
in may  we completed the divestiture of equipment and inventory of this business for million in cash and a percent ownership interest in the purchaser 
we did not record any value for the common stock of the purchaser received in this transaction due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize economic value on the resale of our ownership interest 
in addition  the purchaser executed a sublease on our st 
charles  missouri manufacturing facility for the remaining term of our lease 
due to substantial doubt regarding the purchaser s financial capability to meet its obligation under the sublease  we recorded a liability  at that time  of  which represented our best estimate of the present value of future cash outflows that may arise if the purchaser defaulted on the sublease prior to the completion of its term 
during the quarter ended september   we wrote off uncollectible past due rent receivables from the sublessee in the amount of  and reduced the fair value estimate of our potential liability under the master lease at that time by  to reflect our expectations regarding our ability to identify a new tenant and complete a new sublease on the facility 
in december  the purchaser sold the assets of its business to another business at a price which rendered our equity investment worthless 
coincident with this transaction we received a promissory note in the amount of  from the original purchaser together with an assignment of future commission income to be earned under a commission agreement between the buyer and the original purchaser 
income assignments are to cease when the promissory note is paid in full 
due to substantial doubt regarding our ability to receive payments under the assignment agreement and promissory note  we have fully reserved the value of the promissory note on our books reducing its recorded value to zero 
the acquiring business entered into a sublease agreement on the facility with us for the remaining term of our master lease 
at this time we believe our currently recorded liabilities for discontinued operations are adequate to cover potential future obligations that may arise 
the operating results of this business for the year ended march   and  respectively  have been reported separately as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations includes interest expense on debt used to acquire manufacturing machinery and equipment but does not include allocations of general corporate overheads  which have been allocated to other business segments 
operating results of all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the contract electronics manufacturing as discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march  was  or nil per common share compared to a loss from discontinued operations of  or nil per common share  and  or per common share  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the current year loss represents legal fees incurred for litigation  and rent expense net of sublease payments on our missouri manufacturing facility 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balances and liquidity throughout the fiscal year ended march  were adequate to meet operating needs 
at march   we had working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities of  compared to  at march  the increase of  in working capital is primarily attributable to cash proceeds from a private placement and the exercise of employee stock options and underwriter warrants totaling  lower levels of accounts receivable and inventories  offset by operating losses and lower levels of accounts payable 
for the year ended march   net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to lower levels of accounts receivables and inventories offset by higher operating losses  and lower levels of accounts payable 
the increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended march  versus cash used in operating activities for year ended march  was primarily due to higher levels of operating losses  accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to  for the previous fiscal year 
the change this fiscal year versus last fiscal year was primarily due to cash used for the purchase of short term investment securities of  and investments in property and equipment of  the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  versus cash provided by investing activities for the year ended march  was primarily due to cash used for the purchase of short term investment securities of  net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was  for the fiscal year ended march  versus  for the preceding fiscal year 
the decrease is attributable to reduced cash proceeds from the sale of common stock this year versus last year 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal increased to  versus the fiscal level of  due to increased cash proceeds from the sale of common stock  partially offset by reduced proceeds from bank borrowings 
we expect to manage our operations and working capital requirements to minimize the future level of operating losses and working capital usage consistent with execution of our business plan  however  we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives 
we believe our available cash resources are sufficient to fund our expected level of operations for the next several years 
we have begun  and expect to continue  to make substantial investments from our available cash resources in human resources  manufacturing facilities and equipment  production and application engineering  among other things 
we expect to fund our operations over at least the next several years from existing cash and short term investment balances and from available bank financing  if any 
we can  however  not provide any assurance that our existing financial resources will be sufficient to execute our business plan 
if our existing financial resources are not sufficient to execute our business plan  we may issue equity or debt securities in the future 
in the event financing or equity capital to fund future growth is not available on terms acceptable to us  we will modify our strategy to align our operation with then available financial resources 
contractual obligations the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of march  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations executive employment agreements total includes future salary payments  potential retirement pay  and severance pay obligations of which  has been recorded as long term deferred compensation under executive employment agreements 
does not include sublease payments of  over the remaining term of a facility lease 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that effect the dollar values reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts receivables  costs to complete contracts  recoverability of inventories  and potential future lease obligations arising from discontinued operations 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable our trade accounts receivable are subject to credit risks associated with the financial condition of our customers and their liquidity 
we evaluate all customers periodically to assess their financial condition and liquidity and set appropriate credit limits based on this analysis 
as a result  the collectibility of accounts receivable may change due to changing general economic conditions and factors associated with each customer s particular business 
during fiscal a large  well established customer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result we charged off  owed to us by the customer as a bad debt expense 
because substantially all of our customers are large well established companies with excellent credit worthiness and our view that the bad debt expense associated with our customer s bankruptcy filing is an isolated  customer specific event  we have not established a reserve at march  for potentially uncollectible trade accounts receivable 
it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our trade accounts receivable to decline materially  resulting in material losses 
asset recovery and realization discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of equipment and inventory of our electronics product segment for million in cash and a percent ownership interest in the purchaser 
we did not record any value for the common stock of the purchaser received in this transaction due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize economic value on the resale of our ownership interest 
in addition  the purchaser executed a sublease on our st 
charles  missouri manufacturing facility for the remaining term of our lease 
due to substantial doubt regarding the purchaser s financial capability to meet its obligation under the sublease  we recorded a liability  at that time of  which represented our best estimate of the present value of future cash outflows that may arise if the purchaser defaulted on the sublease prior to the completion of its term 
during the quarter ended september   we wrote off uncollectible past due rent receivables from the sublessee in the amount of  and reduced the fair value estimate of our potential liability under the master lease  at that time  by  to reflect our expectations regarding our ability to identify a new tenant and complete a new sublease on the facility 
in december  the purchaser sold the assets of its business to another business at a price which rendered our equity investment worthless 
coincident with this transaction we received a promissory note in the amount of  from the original purchaser together with an assignment of future commission income to be earned under a commission agreement between the buyer and the original purchaser 
income assignments are to cease when the promissory note is paid in full 
due to substantial doubt regarding our ability to receive payments under the assignment agreement and promissory note  we have fully reserved the value of the promissory note on our books reducing its recorded value to zero 
the acquiring business entered into a sublease agreement on the facility with us for the remaining term of our master lease 
at this time we believe our currently recorded liabilities for discontinued operations are adequate to cover potential future obligations that may arise 
our assessments of the realizable value and collectability of the foregoing financial instruments together with our estimate of future sublease payments could change materially based on future developments and events 
any change in these estimates could result in a material change in our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories we maintain raw material inventories of electronic components  motor parts and other materials to meet our expected manufacturing needs for proprietary products and for products manufactured to the design specifications of our customers 
some of these components may become obsolete or impaired due to bulk purchases in excess of customer requirements 
accordingly  we periodically assesses our raw material inventory for potential impairment of value based on then available information  expectations and estimates and establish impairment reserves for estimated declines in the realizable value of our inventories 
the actual realizable value of our inventories may differ materially from these estimates based on future occurrences 
it is reasonably possible that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of our inventories to decline materially  resulting in additional material impairment losses 
percentage of completion revenue recognition on long term contracts costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts we recognize revenue on the development projects funded by our customers using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract services revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to management s best estimate of the total costs to be incurred to complete the project 
many of these contracts involve the application of our technology to customers products and other applications with demanding specifications 
management s best estimates have sometimes been adversely impacted by unexpected technical challenges requiring additional analysis and redesign  failure of electronic components to operate in accordance with manufacturers published performance specifications  unexpected prototype failures requiring the purchase of additional parts and a variety of other factors that may cause unforeseen delays and additional costs 
it is reasonably possible that total costs to be incurred on any of the projects in process at march  could be materially different from management s estimates  and any modification of management s estimate of total project costs to be incurred could result in material changes in the profitability of affected projects or result in material losses on any affected projects 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when implemented 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions sfas  which replaces the exception permitting non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets from measurement based on the fair value of the assets exchanged with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas will be effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements when implemented 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement over the period the services are deemed to be performed  which is generally the vesting period 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides additional implementation guidance for sfas r 
among other things  sab provides guidance on share based payment valuation  income statement classification and presentation  capitalization of costs and related income tax accounting 
in april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the compliance date for sfas r from the next reporting period after june  to the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  sfas r provides for adoption using either a modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we expect to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  the fair value of all employee stock option awards granted prior to april  and not vested prior to that date  as well as any stock options granted on or after that date  will be recognized as compensation cost in our statement of operations using the straight line method over the requisite service period to the extent such options are expected to vest 
prior to adopting sfas r  forfeitures were accounted for on the date of forfeiture 
estimated compensation cost arising from stock options granted prior to april   but not vested prior to that date under the modified prospective method that will be recognized in fiscal years beginning april  and later  is  we will continue to use the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risks and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
all of our product sales  and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are not subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations
