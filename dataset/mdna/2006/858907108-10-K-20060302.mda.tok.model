our success is highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates 
because we operate in the houston  dallas and san antonio metropolitan areas  the local economic conditions in each of these areas are particularly important 
all three of these local economies showed healthy economic trends during the economic outlook for houston  dallas  and san antonio remains positive  as local economists predict moderate job growth in we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in all three of the markets in which we operate 
for  we expect to generate loan growth in the low to mid teen percentages and deposit growth in the mid to high single digit percentages 
we also expect to be able to improve our asset quality from the current levels 
on an annualized basis  we expect to have net charge offs to average loans in the to basis point range  while reducing our nonperforming loan ratio over the long term 
in order to accomplish these growth initiatives  we plan to invest in our infrastructure and key bankers across all areas of the company 
we intend to control the growth of expenses and look for ways that we can be more productive and efficient 
for the year  we expect our efficiency ratio to be at or near current levels 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
each of these financial instruments reacts differently to interest rates 
from june to december   the federal reserve board increased overnight interest rates by basis points to 
on january   the federal reserve board increased overnight interest rates by an additional basis points to and further rate increases are possible 
in contrast  long term rates have remained mostly flat creating a flattening of the yield curve and  even recently  the yield curve has inverted at certain maturities 
while we are impacted significantly by the size and timing of short term rate increases  as well as the shape of the yield curve and other competitive factors  our balance sheet is generally positioned to benefit from a gradually rising interest rate environment 
during  we were able to show expansion in our net interest margin despite the challenging interest rate environment and expect it to continue to increase modestly during

index to financial statements in  our earnings per share increased compared to additionally  during our overall average earning assets grew by 
asset quality for both our net charge off ratio and our nonperforming loan ratios showed improvement in compared to we continue to look for fairly priced strategic acquisitions in houston  san antonio and dallas 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of dallas based prestonwood bancshares  inc and its subsidiary bank of the oaks bank trust company 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of south texas capital group  inc of san antonio and its subsidiary bank  plaza bank 
in and  we made several decisions designed to more clearly align our operations with our long term vision and strategy 
in  we divested scmc in order to better position us to focus our efforts on the commercial banking needs of small to mid sized businesses 
we have used the net proceeds of the sale to support our ongoing internal growth 
scmc s operations were reported previously as the company s mortgage banking segment  which is reported together with the net gain on sale as discontinued operations 
other areas of our financial statements affected by the sale of scmc are not as easily highlighted 
as a banking operation  the bank benefited by providing scmc with a warehouse line of credit which financed mortgage loans held for sale 
additionally  scmc maintained operating and escrow deposits with the bank reducing the bank s other borrowing needs 
due to decisions made by the buyer of scmc  the bank lost the benefit of these loans and deposit balances shortly after completing the sale of scmc in september during  we also closed one of our banking offices and merged its operations into another location 
we retained substantially all of the loans and deposits associated with this location 
in  we sold five banking offices acquired as part of previous acquisitions 
these five banking offices were sold because their locations  operations and growth potential did not align with our business banking strategy of serving small and mid sized businesses in major metropolitan areas 
critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is important to an understanding of our reported results 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
certain of our accounting policies are considered to be critical because they involve subjective judgment  estimation by management or are particularly complex in their nature 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans and binding commitments 
losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
stock based compensation 
historically  we have accounted for stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method 
because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the measurement date  compensation expense was not 
table of contents 
index to financial statements recognized on options granted 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards was based on the market price of the stock on the date of grant and was recognized ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we have made pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share assuming the fair value based accounting method in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards for stock based compensation have changed 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  on january  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting  and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
the grant date fair value of options will be determined using option pricing models based on subjective assumptions which materially affect the fair value estimate 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
disclosures of stock based compensation are also included note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations performance summary 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  earned for and million  or per diluted share  earned for income from continuing operations was equal to reported net income in and  while income from continuing operations totaled million  or per diluted share  for net income for included million of income from discontinued operations related to the sale of scmc 
income from continuing operations for increased million compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in noninterest expense of million  offset by a decrease in noninterest income of million and an increase in the provision income taxes or million 
net income for the fourth quarter of included a reduction in income tax expense of thousand  or per diluted share as a result of the expiration of previous tax contingencies 
income from continuing operations for decreased million compared to this decrease was primarily due to decreases during in both net interest income and other income of million and million  respectively  and an increase in total noninterest expense of million 
these changes were offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of million and lower provision for income taxes of million 
net income for included total after tax net gains on the sales of securities of million  or per diluted share  impairment charges on certain bank assets totaling million  or per diluted share  net of taxes  and contract termination charges of thousand  or per diluted share  net of taxes

a banking institution s return on average assets and return on average common equity are two commonly used industry measures of performance

index to financial statements net interest income 
net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including loans and securities  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
during the fourth quarter of  the company elected to reclassify loan origination fees  previously included in net interest income  and an offsetting amount of direct origination costs  previously included in salaries and employee benefits 
the company s net interest margin and efficiency ratio  including those in prior periods  decreased as a result of these reclassifications 
these reclassifications had no impact on net income or equity in any of the reported periods 
the federal reserve board significantly influences market interest rates  including rates offered for loans and deposits by many financial institutions 
generally  when the federal reserve board changes the target overnight interest rate charged by banks  the market responds with a similar change in the prime lending rate 
our loan portfolio is impacted significantly by changes in short term interest rates 
between and  the federal reserve board decreased overnight interest rates to 
during this period  market interest rates were near year lows 
this extended period of declining and then low interest rates negatively impacted our net interest margin and net interest income 
from june to december   the federal reserve board increased overnight interest rates by basis points to 
on january   the federal reserve board increased overnight interest rates by an additional basis points to and further rate increases are possible 
our net interest margin began to improve during the second half of continuing into following these increases in short term interest rates 
in contrast  long term interest rates  which are impacted by various forces including national and world wide economies and political and monetary policies  have not increased by the same amount 
at december   the market yield on year us treasury notes was compared with at december  and at december  this has resulted in a general flattening of the interest rate yield curve during since our balance sheet is asset sensitive  our interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities 
however  in the current interest rate environment  the benefit of the company s traditionally asset sensitive position has been impacted 
while we expect to benefit from additional increases in short term interest rates  the flattening of the yield curve and competition for both loans and deposits remain a challenge for the coming year 
in  we expect our net interest margin to continue to improve modestly from its current level with sequential improvements that will be influenced by loan growth  competition for core funding and the sizing and timing of increases in interest rates 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million or from million for our net interest margin was for compared to for overall  our net interest income and net interest margin were higher during  as compared with  because of higher earning asset volumes and higher interest rates 
net interest income for decreased million or compared to our net interest margin for was compared to for net interest income and margin during decreased compared to primarily due to the impact of the sale of scmc and the decrease in interest rates during and the first half of as discussed above 
changes in the mix of interest earning assets and liabilities influence our net interest income and net interest margin 
details of the changes of the various components of net interest income and net interest margin are discussed below 
average interest earning assets for increased million or compared to the average yield earned on interest earning assets increased basis points for the same time period 
these increases were due primarily to an increase in average loans held for investment of million or for compared to and the increases in interest rates as discussed above 
during  average loans held for investment were of interest earning assets compared to for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements average interest earning assets decreased million or in compared to the average yield earned on interest earning assets decreased basis points in compared to these decreases resulted  in part  from a decrease in average loans held for sale of million compared to average loans held for sale for included million related to the mortgage warehouse we financed for scmc 
on september   we completed the sale of scmc and we lost the benefit of the mortgage warehouse shortly after completing the sale when the buyer decided to pay off this credit facility 
the decrease in interest income resulting from lower loan volumes was offset somewhat by additional investments in securities with lower yields than that of the mortgage warehouse 
on average  the securities portfolio was higher by million or for compared to  and million or for compared to beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we increased the size of the investment portfolio for balance sheet liquidity purposes and to replace a portion of the earning assets related to our mortgage banking operation 
during the last six months of  we reduced the growth of our investment portfolio and reinvested some of our investment cash flows into the loan portfolio 
interest income on the securities portfolio increased million for compared to and million for compared to these increases were due primarily to changes in the size of the securities portfolio 
additionally  during we sold our lower yielding treasury securities and redeployed these funds into higher yielding mortgage backed securities with a profile similar to those in the existing investment portfolio 
average interest bearing liabilities for increased million or compared to the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points during these increases were due  in part  to an increase in average short term borrowings of million for the average cost of short term borrowings increased basis points for primarily in response to the increases in overnight interest rates noted above 
the increase in interest expense of million for compared to on short term borrowings was partially offset by increases in funding provided by both lower cost interest and noninterest bearing deposits 
interest and noninterest bearing demand deposits increased on average million and million  respectively  for compared to the average cost of interest bearing deposits increased basis points for compared to average interest bearing liabilities for were billion  a decrease of million or compared to the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased six basis points from for to for the average balance of short term borrowings and notes payable decreased million or compared to we repaid certain borrowings and notes payable immediately after the sale of our mortgage banking operations in the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was due primarily to decreases in market interest rates mentioned above 
the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities helped offset the impact of declining yields on interest earning assets 
competitive pressures often limit our ability to reduce rates on deposits by the same amount as that of loans during periods of declining rates

insufficient fund fees have decreased during and partially due to improvements in asset quality wherein certain marginal relationships exited the bank 

table of contents 
index to financial statements lower net gains on trading assets in and losses on trading assets in were attributable to a decrease in trading activity and the market conditions for these types of assets as compared to trading assets are carried at fair market value in our consolidated balance sheets 
net gains on the sale of securities for were not significant and were the result of routine portfolio management activities 
net gains on the sale of securities for were primarily the result of two separate securitization transactions during in which we sold million of certain interest only securities held in our available for sale portfolio 
we received proceeds of million which resulted in net gains totaling million during the company did not retain any interests in these securities  and neither the investors in the securitization trusts nor the trusts have any recourse other than for a breach of customary representations as to ownership and origination  but not for credit loss or default 
these gains were partially offset by a realized loss of thousand for the sale of lower yielding us treasury securities during the second quarter of net gains on the sale of loans increased thousand for compared to the increase for over was due primarily to an increase in the volume of loan sales 
net gains on the sale of loans increased slightly in to thousand from thousand in during the third quarter of  we sold million of performing commercial real estate loans as part of our wholesale capital markets operations

after a review by management and employees  numerous expense reduction and alignment projects were identified  including the consolidation of smaller offices  disposition of unprofitable initiatives  modification of certain perquisite benefit programs and continued reductions in staffing levels through attrition 
these projects have helped to reduce our current noninterest expense base and allowed for greater control of expense growth in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements salaries and employee benefits for decreased thousand compared to this decrease was due in part to a reduction in staffing levels through attrition and modification of certain perquisite benefit programs 
staffing levels increased from full time equivalent employees at december  to  at december the company added full time equivalent employees during the last six months of principally related to new offices acquired with the oaks bank acquisition and to support growth 
salaries and employee benefits for increased million or compared to this increase was primarily related to increased staffing levels  merit based and market driven salary increases and increases in incentive pay and profit sharing 
staffing levels increased in large part due to the three new offices we obtained in the plaza bank acquisition which occurred on october  we had full time equivalent employees at december  compared with  at december  the full time equivalent employee count decreased during the latter part of due to the expense management initiative previously discussed

these reductions were the result of the expiration of previous tax contingencies and refunds received  including the filing of various state and federal tax returns related to our mortgage banking segment

loans acquired in the acquisition of the oaks bank on september  totaled million 
we have experienced good growth in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and construction lending portfolios during during the third quarter of  we sold million of performing commercial real estate loans as a part of our wholesale capital markets operations 
our primary lending focus is commercial and industrial loans and owner occupied real estate loans to businesses with annual sales ranging from thousand to million 
typically  our customers have financing requirements between thousand and million 
the bank s legal lending limit was million at december  and was not exceeded by any single loan relationship 
we make commercial loans primarily to small and mid sized businesses and to professionals 
our commercial loan products include revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  working capital loans  loans to finance accounts receivable and inventory and equipment finance leases 
commercial loans typically have floating rates of interest and are for varying terms generally not exceeding three years 
in most instances  these loans are personally guaranteed by the business owner and are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or other business assets 
in addition to the commercial loans secured solely by non real estate business assets  we make commercial loans that are secured by owner occupied real estate  as well as other business assets 
commercial mortgage loans are often secured by first liens on real estate  typically have floating interest rates  and are most often amortized over a year period with balloon payments due at the end of three years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  we give consideration to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
our capital markets group originates  co originates or purchases first lien  commercial real estate mortgage loans referred by other financial institutions nationwide 
more than of these loans have variable interest rates and amortize over twenty to twenty five years 
these loans generally have low loan to value ratios below and many have a us small business administration second lien behind our first lien 
we utilize real estate appraisers familiar with the geographic region in which the property is located in evaluating potential loans 
these appraisals are reviewed by a third party appraisal review vendor for accuracy and compliance with our underwriting standards and banking regulations 
these loans supplement our growth in our niche market segment  small to medium sized businesses 
we also make loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties  such as retail shopping centers and commercial office buildings 
generally  construction loans are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates

the subordinated notes may not be redeemed or called prior to their maturity 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in which the bank swapped the fixed rate to a floating rate 
under the terms of the swap agreement  we receive a fixed coupon rate of and pay a variable interest rate equal to the three month libor that is reset on a quarterly basis  plus 
this swap is designated as a fair value hedge that qualifies for the shortcut method of accounting

our nonperforming and past due loans are substantially collateralized by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  we receive updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
potential problem loans are those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms 
management identifies these loans through its ongoing loan review process

interest foregone on nonaccrual loans was approximately million and million during and  respectively 
accruing loans past due days or more at december  totaled thousand compared to million at december  the balance at december  included loans to one borrower totaling million which were paid off in early allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses are determined based on the historical credit loss experience  changes in the loan portfolio  including size  mix and risk of the individual loans  and current economic conditions 
we monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  on past due amounts  on related collateral values  on the number and size of the non performing loans and on the resulting amount of charges offs for the period

we are vigorously pursuing recovery of this loan through the court system 
during the first quarter of  we sold million of nonperforming loans which increased charge offs by million 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation reserve consisting of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
it is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations  our history of credit experience and our ongoing internal credit reviews

we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall probability of collection 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
we are targeting a loan review penetration of at least annually of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectibility 
all doubtful and loss loans are considered impaired 
substandard loans are defined as impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  both interest and principal  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of impaired loan and its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur or that at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million all of which were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements  deficiencies that require attention in the short run  or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   watch list loans totaled million 
management assigns loan grades by individual loan and allocations are made within each loan grade 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based  in part  on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs

an interest sensitive asset or liability is one that experiences changes in cashflows as a direct result of changes in market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk  remaining mindful of the relationship between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies for the management of interest rate risk are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we measure interest rate risk using a variety of methodologies including  but not limited to  dynamic simulation analysis  gap analysis and static balance sheet rate shocks 
dynamic simulation analysis is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk and allow us to model the effects of non parallel movements in multiple yield curves  changes in borrower and depositor behaviors  changes in loan and deposit pricing  and changes in loan and deposit portfolio compositions and growth rates over a month horizon 
a gap analysis measures maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time 
a bank is considered asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a bank is considered liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period

this analysis estimates a percentage of change in these metrics from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change over a month horizon as of december  and changes in interest rates basis points increase decrease in net interest income december  base december  base these sensitivities are all within the thresholds set by our asset liability committee 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions

index to financial statements market rates will have on the company 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market factors 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
a number of factors have affected the change in the simulations from to among these are loan pricing assumptions that have resulted from the flattening of the yield curve as well as competitive pressures 
additionally  the increases in interest rates over the last months have restored much of the balance sheet s optionality in decreasing rate environments
