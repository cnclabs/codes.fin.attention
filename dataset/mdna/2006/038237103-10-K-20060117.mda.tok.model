item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog 
because of possible future changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period  and actual sales for t he year may not meet or exceed the backlog represented 
we may experience significant contract cancellations that were previously booked and included in backlog 
research and development we conduct r d pursuant to united states government r d contracts and as part of our own r d investment 
we believe that our investment in r d provides us with a significant competitive advantage 
research and development expenses incurred by us were approximately   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percent of revenue  r d equated to   and in fiscal years   and respectively 
in fiscal years  and  our r d program was funded entirely by the billing rates charged to our customers 
we seek to develop technology capable of addressing new global security signal processing requirements before our competitors 
in addition  we focus r d on developing products and services that can be used  with or without further modification  to satisfy various needs of a variety of customers  thereby permitting us to offer a prompt solution 
company technical operations the technical operations of ast consists of a communications systems group  a sensor signal processing group  an electronic systems division  and an operations division 
all of these organizations report to our chief operating officer 
because of the integral technologies and operations of our groups and divisions to date  we have determined that ast has only one corporate wide reporting entity 
the communications systems group provides our comint products and services  and research and development for comint collection and processing solutions 
within the communications systems group are two engineering divisions  the wireless communications systems division and the multichannel systems division 
the sensor signal processing group provides advanced sensor signal processing solutions for advanced space based  airborne  terrestrial  and undersea sensor technologies 
within the sensor signal processing group are two engineering divisions  the ocean systems division and the national security systems division 
the electronic systems division  an engineering division  provides research and development for solutions to elint requirements 
the operations division is primarily responsible for manufacturing multiple units of products for our divisions and groups 
the engineering and operations organizations work together to ensure that production related issues  such as reliability  maintenance  and the ability to manufacture  are addressed from initial product definition through the final product shipment 
as of december   there were employees in the engineering organizations and employees in the operations division 
see employees on page engineering the engineering organizations are responsible for all of our r d activities 
our r d activities include both united states government development contracts and our own r d projects 
the r d activities of the engineering organizations are directed toward developing products that will ultimately be produced by the operations division  and solutions that will be sold as software licenses or open architecture equipment 
the engineering organizations work in conjunction with the operations division to assure that the product development efforts will culminate in a product that can be manufactured efficiently in quantity 
operations the operations division is responsible for manufacturing multiple units of products 
by combining engineering and production expertise within the operations division  we are able to maximize manufacturing efficiency and  therefore  reduce overall production costs 
the operations division uses batch production methods to manufacture products 
the division s extensive cross training of personnel enables workers to participate in the manufacturing of all products  which helps to achieve labor efficiency 
the division is also responsible for managing purchases of goods and services  including third party manufacturing and assembly services 
competition the global security market is highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to increase in the future 
some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial  and marketing resources than we do 
our current competitors include l communications  bae systems  boeing  raytheon corporation  general dynamics  harris corporation  lockheed martin  northrop grumman  argon st  digital receiver technology  edo corporation  qinetiq  and sierra nevada corporation 
substantial competition could impose pricing pressure on sales of our products  develop and introduce new products meeting market demand more quickly than we can  and result in lower revenue and decreased sales  which would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
the competition for competitive bid contracts differs from the competition for sole source contracts 
companies competing for competitive bid contracts prepare bids and proposals in response to either commercial or government requests and typically compete on price 
potential suppliers compete informally for sole source contracts through r d investment and marketing efforts 
companies competing for sole source contracts attempt to identify the customer s requirements early and invest in solutions so that they can demonstrate a distinguishing expertise or technology promptly after the customer has identified a signal processing requirement 
the principal factors of competition for sole source contracts include investments in r d  the ability to respond promptly to government needs  and product price relative to performance  quality  and customer support 
we believe that we compete favorably on each of these factors 
proprietary rights the united states government has rights to most of the technology that we have developed under government contracts  including rights to permit other companies  including our competitors  to use this technology to develop products for the united states government 
to our knowledge  the united states government has not exercised these rights related to our products 
as of october   we had four issued patents 
we believe that  given the rapidly changing nature of signal collection and processing technology  our future success will depend primarily upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel  rather than the legal protection afforded by patents 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers  employees  and consultants  and through other security measures 
to the extent we wish to assert our patent rights  we cannot be sure that any claims of our patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  that any rights granted under these patents will provide us adequate protection  or that there will be sufficient resources to protect and enforce our rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countr ies may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
although we do not believe that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  it is possible that such a claim will be asserted against us in the future 
in the event any third party makes a claim against us for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party  such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation 
in addition  we could experience loss or cancellation of customer orders  product shipment delays  or could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if our products were found to infringe on a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to continue selling our products 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available under acceptable terms or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
our involvement in any pate nt dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and expertise could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
government regulations many of our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal  state  and municipal authorities  including regulations concerning employment obligations and affirmative action  workplace safety  and protection of the environment 
most importantly  we must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with united states government security regulations  certain of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations 
failure to comply with our government procurement or contracting obligations or security obligations could result in penalties imposed against us or suspension from government contracting  which would prevent us from selling our products to the united states government  severely limiting our ability to operate our business and generate revenue  resulting in a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
see item business customers  contracts  and marketing on page 
while compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected our operations in the past  we cannot be sure that we will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change  resulting in increased operational costs 
employees as of december   we had employees 
our business requires that a large number of our technical employees obtain security clearances from the united states government  which limits the available pool of eligible candidates for such positions to those who can satisfy the prerequisites to obtaining these clearances 
in particular  the personnel involved in marketing require the appropriate clearances to meet with government technical representatives and discuss the government s needs 
we have a united states government sanctioned security program that allows staff members to obtain appropriate clearances 
approximately of our staff has security clearances 
our success is dependent on attracting  retaining  and motivating qualified key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business materially 
we believe we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
item a risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we are subject to a number of special risks as a result of our acquisition of dynamics technology  inc on july   we acquired dti for approximately million  plus estimated transaction costs 
our future results of operations will be substantially influenced by the operations of the new business unit  and as a result of the acquisition  we will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following we continue to integrate the technologies and operations of dti  and if we do not complete this integration in a timely and efficient manner  management resources could be diverted and our business and operating results could suffer 
we are a larger  more geographically dispersed and complex organization  and if our management is unable to effectively manage the combined company  our operating results will suffer 
as a result of the acquisition  we are entering markets in which ast has no or limited prior experience 
we may not be successful in these markets  and we may be unable to retain all existing  or enter into new  contracts for dti s business lines 
in addition  we may not achieve the strategic objectives and other anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition 
our failure to achieve these strategic objectives could have a material  adverse effect on our revenues  expenses  and operating results 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition have been included as part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes 
in addition  we may incur charges to operations in amounts that are not currently estimable  in the quarters following the acquisition  to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies  and we will continue to record additional operating expenses associated with the amortization of other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition 
these costs could adversely affect our future liquidity and operating results 
both companies had as their largest customer the us government 
the contracts entered into by both companies with the us government are terminable by the us government 
it is still too early to determine whether the us government will maintain existing  or enter into new contracts with the combined company 
it is possible that  as a result of the acquisition  our customers may delay or defer contracting decisions  which could have a material  adverse effect on our business 
as a result of the acquisition  we incurred debt in the amount of million  and our failure to repay this debt when due would materially  adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisition will increase the cost and complexity of complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of with regard to the evaluation and attestation of our internal control systems 
we may also be assuming unknown liabilities  risk the incurrence of expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill  or the incurrence of other large write offs immediately or in the future 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our investments in new business opportunities and any such investments could have a negative  material impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we have formed the electronic systems division in order to expand our historical comint business into elint 
this diversification requires us to invest additional capital  open new facilities  and incur additional r d expenditures 
in addition  diversification results in diversion of management s attention from our core business 
although we believe that entering into these new business areas will be important to remaining competitive in the defense electronics marketplace  there can be no assurance that we will derive benefits from this diversification and we could incur significant unanticipated costs  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
any decrease in expected product sales during a period could adversely impact our revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
from time to time  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from product sales 
in recent periods  however  we have been focusing on sales of systems and software  and targeting larger programs 
in addition  we have experienced some seasonality in product sales to the us government  with more product sales occurring in the second half of the fiscal year than the first 
the amount and timing of government purchases of products is unpredictable  and fluctuates significantly from period to period  making it difficult for us to predict the amount of revenue we will generate from product sales in any particular period  and causing our revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
if we are not able to generate revenues from product sales as expected in a particular period  we may fai l to meet our revenue expectations and the expectations of industry analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we are unable to recruit  train  and retain key personnel with required security clearances  our ability to develop  introduce  and sell our products may be adversely impacted 
our ability to execute our business plan is contingent upon successfully attracting and retaining qualified employees who obtain  or are able to obtain  necessary government security clearances 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified employees who can obtain the necessary security clearances  our business could be significantly harmed 
the loss of the services of any of our qualified employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop  introduce  and sell our products 
in addition  employees may leave us and subsequently compete against us 
many of the personnel we hire will need us government security clearances in order to perform tasks required on our government contracts 
we have found that there is a shortage of qualified personnel possessing the necessary clearances  and new security clearances are taking longer to be granted 
if we are not able to obtain security clearances for our personnel where required  they will be unable to perform tasks requiring clearances  and we may be unable to satisfy the terms of our contracts  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and possible loss of current or future contracts 
stop work orders could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
almost all of our contracts contain stop work clauses that permit the other contracting party  at any time  by written order  to stop work on all or any part of the work called for by the contract for a period of ninety days 
within the ninety day period  the other contracting party may cancel the stop work order and resume work or terminate all or part of the work covered by the stop work order 
for example  during june  we received a stop work order instructing us to stop work on a portion of our largest single contract 
in accordance with the instructions received from the other contracting party  we prepared a proposal that detailed the tasks that were stopped and estimated the reduction in contract costs 
final negotiations were completed during the fourth quarter of new orders and backlog were reduced by approximately million 
as a result of the stop work order  we estimate that our opportunity to generate revenues from this contract was reduced by approximately to million in fiscal year  by approximately to million in fiscal year  and the balance in fiscal year there can be no assurance that stop work orders will not be received in future periods 
any reduction in government spending on global security could materially adversely impact our revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
historically  defense and intelligence agencies of the united states government have accounted for almost all of our revenues 
there are risks associated with programs that are subject to appropriation by congress  which could be potential targets for reductions in funding to pay for other programs 
future reductions in united states government spending on global security or future changes in the kind of products or services required by the united states government agencies could limit demand for our products and services  which would have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in the event there are shifts in responsibilities and functions within the defense and intelligence communities  it could result in a reduction of orders for global security by the defense and intelligence agencies that have historically been our major customers 
our relationships with other government agencies to whom responsibilities and functions for our contracts have been shifted may not be as strong as our relationships with current customer agencies 
accordingly  a reduction in contracts from our customer agencies may not be offset by contracts from other united states government agencies 
even if other agencies increase spending for global security  we may not secure the same amount of work from these agencies 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline  resulting in a decrease in revenues  and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition materially 
if we are unable to comply with complex government regulations governing security and contracting practices  we could be disqualified as a supplier to the united states government 
as a supplier to united states government defense and intelligence agencies  we must comply with numerous regulations  including those governing security and contracting practices 
failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts 
if we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies  we will lose most  if not all  of our customers  revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly  and our ability to continue operations would be seriously jeopardized 
among the causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes  including those related to proc urement integrity  export control  us government security regulations  employment practices  protection of the environment  accuracy of records in the recording of costs  and foreign corruption 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting 
depending on the results of these audits and investigations  the government may make claims against us  and if it prevails  certain incurred costs would not be recoverable 
we depend on revenues from a few significant contracts  and any loss  cancellation  reduction  or delay in these contracts could harm our business 
from time to time  including recent periods  we have derived a material portion of our revenue from one or more individual contracts that could be terminated by the customer at the customer s discretion 
we expect that in future periods we may again enter into individual contracts with significant revenue concentrations 
if such contracts were terminated or substantially reduced  revenues and net income could significantly decline  and we have in the past experienced a significant reduction on one of our contracts 
us government contracts are generally not fully funded at inception and funding may be terminated or reduced at any time 
we act as a prime contractor or subcontractor for many different us government programs 
department of defense and intelligence contracts typically involve long lead times for design and development and are subject to significant changes in contract scheduling 
congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
the termination or reduction of funding for a government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program 
many of our government contracts span one or more base years with multiple option terms 
government agencies generally have the right not to exercise these option terms 
if an option term on a contract is not exercised  we will not be able to recognize the full value of the contract awarded 
our backlog as of october  was approximately million 
we exclude from backlog unexercised options on contracts 
our backlog includes orders under awards that in some cases extend several years 
the actual receipt of revenues on awards included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change or the program could be canceled  or a contract could be reduced  modified  or terminated early 
our business depends upon our relationships with  and the performance of  our prime contractors 
we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a substantial portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
our business  prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or relationships with us  either because they choose to establish relationships with our competitors or because they choose to directly offer services that compete with our business  or if the government terminates or reduces these other contractors programs or does not award them new contracts 
in addition  on those contracts for which we are not the prime contractor  the us government could terminate a prime contract under which we are subcontractor  irrespective of the quality of our performance as a subcontractor 
a prime contractor s performance deficiencies could adversely affect our status as a subcontractor on the program  jeopardize our ability to collect award or incentive fees  cause customers to delay payments  and result in contract terminations 
we depend on revenues from a few significant customers  the loss of any significant customer could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers 
the markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of governmental agencies and allies of the united states government  thereby limiting the number of potential customers 
our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our largest customers  that we will be able to attract additional customers  or that our customers will continue to buy our products and services in the same amounts as in prior years 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers  any reduction or delay in sales to these customers  our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers  or future price concessions that we may have to make could significantly harm our business 
continued competition in global security may lead to a reduction in our revenues and market share 
the global security market is highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to increase in the future 
our current competitors have significantly greater technical  manufacturing  financial  and marketing resources than we do 
we expect that more companies will enter the market for global security  possibly resulting in pricing pressures on our products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in reduced revenue  lower margins  or loss of market share  any of which could significantly harm our business 
our competitors may introduce improved products with lower prices  and we will have to do the same to remain competitive 
unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture our products under fixed price contracts may cause us to experience unreimbursed cost overruns 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in materials costs  inefficiencies  or other factors  are borne by us 
we have experienced cost overruns in the past that have resulted in losses on certain contracts  and may experience additional cost overruns in the future 
such cost overruns would increase our operating expenses  reduce our net income and earnings per share  and could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
unexpected contract terminations could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
almost all of our contracts contain termination clauses that permit contract termination upon our default or for the convenience of the other contracting party 
in either case  termination could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
there were no such notifications in fiscal years or our future revenues are inherently unpredictable  our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline significantly 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are outside our control 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
some of the factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include conditions inherent in government contracting and our business such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts  the united states government contracting and budget cycles  and contract closeouts 
because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business 
fluctuations in quarterly results  competition  or announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation may cause earnings to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
in addition  there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained for our common stock 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock 
our market is subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively  we must continually introduce new signal processing solutions and create contractual obligations that achieve market acceptance 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we believe that we have been successful to date in identifying certain global security needs early  investing in research and development to meet these needs  and delivering products before our competitors 
we believe that our future success will depend upon continued development and timely introduction of products capable of satisfying emerging global security needs 
however  we expect that new requirements will continue to emerge 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction  and market acceptance of new and en hanced products that address these new requirements 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market new products successfully in the future or respond effectively to new requirements  or that new products introduced by others will not render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or to license these technologies from third parties 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations difficulties with contract manufacturers changing market or competitive product requirements unanticipated engineering complexities the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market  or support new or enhanced products successfully  or on a timely basis  if at all 
further  we cannot ensure that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes  or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to write off inventory deemed not saleable or usable 
some of our products or raw materials may become obsolete or unusable while in inventory 
this could be due to changing customer specifications  decreases in demand for existing products  or changes in government spending on signal intelligence 
work in process deemed not saleable is written off to contract costs in our statement of operations  while unusable raw materials are written off to general and administrative expenses 
we may lose sales if our suppliers fail to meet our needs 
although we procure most of our parts and components from multiple sources or believe that these components are readily available from numerous sources  certain components are available only from sole sources or from a limited number of sources 
while we believe that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained  use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require us to re engineer our products  or both  which could delay shipment of our products and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our headquarters and most of our operations are located in california where natural disasters may occur  resulting in disruption to our business 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations and production facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
a significant earthquake could materially affect operating results 
we are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind  and do not presently have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster 
in the event of such disaster  our business would suffer 
delays in the receipt of contracts could negatively impact our business 
during our history  the receipt of certain final contracts has periodically been delayed to periods later than originally expected 
while we work closely with our customers to try to capture what we believe to be sole source orders  delays in the receipt of such orders could result in revenues falling short of estimates 
on some of these contracts  we will make expenditures in advance of receipt of the final contract in anticipation of meeting the expected timetables  and will from time to time hire personnel in anticipation of receipt of the contract 
if the contract is delayed  these costs are not covered 
in addition  gross margins and net income will decrease if we elect to hold our cost structure in place while awaiting the award of delayed contracts 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we license certain of our proprietary technology to customers  and we rely largely on provisions of our licensing agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in this technology 
to date  we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know how to protect our intellectual property 
although we have filed applications for several patents  four of which we currently hold  we cannot ensure that any patents will be issued as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litiga tion costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation co uld result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  and could significantly harm our business 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
it is possible that from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark  and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adverse to us  could significantly harm our business 
any claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could significantly harm our business 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  our agreem ents with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
in the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology  or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
continued compliance with new regulatory and accounting requirements will be challenging and is likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations 
as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as changes to listing standards adopted by the nasdaq stock market  and the attestation and accounting changes required by the securities and exchange commission  we are required to implement additional internal controls  to improve our existing internal controls  and to comprehensively document and test our internal controls 
as a result  we are required to hire additional personnel and to obtain additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other requirements to account for employee st ock options as a compensation expense among others  are expected to materially increase the expenses that we report under generally accepted accounting principles  which may adversely affect our operating results 
changes in stock option accounting rules are expected to adversely impact our operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we have historically used broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
historically  we elected to apply apb and the disclosure provisions of sfas and accordingly we did not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options for periods up to and including october  as long as such options were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement r  share based payment  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value 
the sec has issued rules which allow companies to implement statement r at the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after june  consistent with the new rule  we will be required to adopt statement r in the first quarter of our fiscal year  and will implement the new standard on a prospective basis 
we are continuing to evaluate the effect that the adoption of statement r will have on our financial position and results of operations  we expect that our adoption of this standard will adversely affect our operating results in future periods

our business requires that we maintain a facility clearance  sponsored and approved by the united states government  at most of our offices 
this approval could be suspended or revoked if we are found not to have complied with security regulations applicable to such facilities 
any revocation or suspension of such approval that materially delayed delivery of our products to customers would have a material adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and sell our products and operate our business 
although we have adopted policies directed at assuring our compliance with relevant regulations  there can be no assurance that the approved status of our facilities will continue without interruption 
item legal proceedings we are subject to litigation  from time to time  in the ordinary course of business including  but not limited to  allegations of wrongful termination or discrimination or governmental agency investigations 
as a government contractor  we may also be subject to investigations by the united states government for alleged violations of procurement or other federal laws

cv sba nd nd the consolidated complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased our securities during a class period of august  through february  the complaint names us  our chief executive officer  and our chief financial officer as defendants  and alleges that false and misleading statements regarding us were issued during the class period 
we believe that there are meritorious defenses against this litigation and intend to vigorously defend it 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation 
any unfavorable outcom e of the litigation could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations

overview applied signal technology  inc  ast provides advanced digital signal processing products  systems  and services in support of intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr for global security 
we provide processing of both man made and non man made signals 
the man made signal processing is for both communications intelligence comint and electronic intelligence elint 
the non man made signal processing is applied to phenomenological sensors 
our primary customer is the united states government 
we develop and manufacture equipment for both the collection and processing of signals 
comint derives intelligence from telecommunications signals 
our comint signal collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan through potentially thousands of cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  and military transmissions in the radio frequency rf spectrum with the goal of collecting certain specific signals 
our comint signal processing equipment uses advanced software and hardware to evaluate characteristics of the collected signals and selects those most likely to contain relevant information 
at inception  our efforts were primarily focused on comint processing equipment 
over time  we have broadened our scope to add specialized collection equipment and complete signal processing systems and related services 
elint derives intelligence from signals associated with weapon systems 
our investment in elint is directed toward the development of equipment for the collection and processing of weapons systems signals 
this equipment will be able to scan the radar bands associated with weapons systems and determine the type of system and its precise location for battlefield characterization and force protection 
the equipment will also analyze the command and control signals associated with these weapons systems to provide information about battlefield readiness 
our elint initiatives are new and to date we have derived no revenue from the sale of elint products or services 
we believe that there continues to be an interest in intelligence by the us government to respond to the threat of terrorist activities and the war against terrorism  and that we are well positioned to benefit from the spending that might result 
we believe that our comint business has strong growth potential and that our move into the elint business provides us an opportunity to diversify into a complementary business 
as a result of this diversification  we expect to make additional investments of capital and management resources  including additional personnel and facilities 
we are investing research and development into developing elint collection and processing equipments  and expect to continue to grow this business during the coming quarters 
in order to diversify into phenomenological sensor signal processing  we acquired dynamics technology  inc dti on july  dti was a privately held california corporation headquartered in torrance  california with offices in anaheim  california and arlington  virginia 
dti was a provider of advanced sensor signal processing solutions for advanced space based  airborne  terrestrial  and undersea sensor technologies 
we acquired dti for million in cash and funded the purchase from our cash and investments and a term loan that we entered into with wells fargo bank  national association  in the principal amount of million 
ten percent of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account for twelve months from closing date to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of the dti shareholders 
in addition  we incurred an estimated million of related transaction costs 
we continue to focus our operations on assuring program performance  meeting staffing requirements  maintaining a competitive cost structure  and diversifying our marketplace 
while our customers continue to come to us with new requirements for intelligence solutions  weighted heavily toward new developments  we have experienced strong proposal activity in the current quarter 
we continue to face challenges meeting the execution requirements of the contracts in backlog and continue to emphasize increased hiring in order to meet all of our program commitments 
a significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated by cost reimbursable contracts that tend to be developmental in nature  and require highly specialized  technical skill sets 
we believe that this trend will continue through the end of fiscal year our contracts can be divided into two major types fixed price and cost reimbursement 
fixed price contracts are typically characterized by negotiated prices for efforts that involve little or no development risk 
cost risks associated with building and delivering products under fixed price contracts are borne solely by the contractor 
cost reimbursement types of contracts are characterized by negotiated target costs and fees  and are generally associated with engineering development work where there is a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
although risks associated with cost reimbursement contracts are borne by the customer  we cannot exceed contract ceilings without the approval of our customer 
cost reimbursement contracts typically do not return as high a profit margin as fixed price contracts  and accordingly  our profit margin will be affected by the mix of our orders by contract type 
four contracts represented an aggregate of of revenues for fiscal year  and three contracts represented an aggregate of and of revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
these contracts are all cost reimbursement contracts 
the following table represents our revenue concentration during the respective periods by contract type fy fy fy cost reimbursement contracts fixed price contracts we believe that the mix of contract types in fiscal year will be similar to fiscal year cost reimbursement contracts can include fixed fees  incentive fees  or award fees 
in the case of cost plus fixed fee contracts  the fee dollars are negotiated and fixed at the inception of the contract 
cost plus incentive fee contracts include a negotiated fee that may be adjusted during the performance of the contract by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs 
cost plus award fee contracts can include fees consisting of a base amount that is fixed at the inception of the contract and an award amount that is earned in whole or in part during the performance of the contract based upon the evaluation of the customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions  and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be critical accounting policies 
see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies  included elsewhere in this report for more information about these c ritical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our contracts are accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of opinion  accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are executed by using written contractual arrangements  most of which require us to design  develop  manufacture  and or modify our complex products  and perform related services according to specifications provided by the customer 
we account for cost reimbursement contracts by charging actual labor  materials  and other direct costs  plus estimated indirect costs of operations as incurred incurred costs 
indirect costs include overhead  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
indirect costs are not applied to subcontract costs that are in excess of  and that meet certain other predetermined criteria 
we recognize contract revenues and profits on cost reimbursement contracts by applying an estimated fee rate to all incurred costs on an individual contract basis 
fee calculations are based on either negotiated fee amounts or management s assessment of the fee amounts that are likely to be earned 
our policy for recognizing interim fees on our cost plus award fee contracts is based on management s assessment as to the likelihood that the award fee or an incremental portion of the award fee will be earned  on a contract by contract basis 
management s assessments are based on numerous factors including contract terms  nature of the work to be performed  our relationship and history with the customer  our history with similar types of projects  and our current and anticipated performance on the specific contract 
no award fee is recognized until management determines that it is probable that an award fee or a portion thereof will be earned 
historically  management s estimates have generally been consistent with actual fees awarded 
however  changes in facts and circumstances could arise within an award fee period causing management to either lower or raise the award fee estimate in the period in which it occurs 
our engineering services contracts are typically performed on a level of effort basis 
revenue is recognized in accordance with our policy regarding cost reimbursement contracts 
we account for fixed price contracts by using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  labor  materials  and other direct costs  plus estimated indirect costs of operations are charged as incurred incurred costs 
a portion of the contract revenue  based on estimated profits and the degree of completion of the contract as measured by a comparison of the actual and estimated costs  is recognized as revenue each period 
for those contracts in which all of the terms have not yet been finalized  revenue does not include an estimated fee rate on cost 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly 
revenues and profits are adjusted on all contracts in the period in which changes  including anticipated losses  become determinable 
unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies  or other factors  are borne by us on fixed price contracts  and could have a materially adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
unexpected cost increases in cost reimbursement contracts may be borne by us for purposes of maintaining customer relationships 
historically  the effect on operating results and financial condition from cost reimbursement losses has been minimal 
indirect rate variance adjustment to operations 
we record contract revenues and costs of operations for interim reporting purposes based on annual targeted indirect rates 
during our interim reporting periods  variances may accumulate between the actual indirect rates and the annual targeted rates 
timing related indirect spending variances are removed from contract costs  research and development  and general and administrative expenses and are included in inventory as part of work in process during these interim reporting periods 
these rates are reviewed regularly  and we record adjustments for any material  permanent variances in the period they become determinable 
we believe that this estimate is the preferred practice used within our industry 
at year end  the revenues and costs are adjusted for actual indirect rates 
our accounting policy for recording the indirect rate variance is based on management s belief that variances accumulated during interim reporting periods will be absorbed by expected contract activities during the remainder of the year 
we consider the rate variance to be unfavorable when our actual indirect rates are greater than our annual targeted rates 
in contrast  a favorable rate variance occurs when our actual indirect rates are lower than our annual targeted rates 
during interim reporting periods  unfavorable rate variances are recorded as reductions to operating expenses and increases to work in process inventory 
favorable rate variances are recorded as increases to operating expenses and decreases to work in process inventory 
if we anticipate that actual contract activities will be different than planned levels  there are alternatives we can utilize to reduce the variance we can adjust some of our planned indirect spending during the year  modify our billing rates to our customers  or record adjustments to expense based on estimates of future contract activities 
if our rate variance is unfavorable  the modification of our billing rates will likely increase revenue and operating expenses  and decrease inventory 
fee percentages on fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts will generally decline as a result of any increase to indirect costs 
if our rate variance is favorable  the modification of our billing rates will decrease revenue and operating expenses  and increase inventory 
in this event  fee percentages on fixed price contracts will generally increase 
fee percentages on cost reimbursable contracts will generally be unaffected as a result of any reduction to indirect costs  due to the fact that programs will typically expend all of the funds available 
any impact on operating income  however  depends on a number of other factors  including mix of contract types  contract terms  and anticipated performance on specific contracts  and anticipated changes in inventory 
during fiscal year  we absorbed an unfavorable indirect rate variance that accumulated during the fiscal year  by modifying our billing rates to our customers  which increased revenues by approximately  and operating expenses by approximately  at the end of fiscal year  we absorbed a favorable indirect rate variance that accumulated during the fiscal year  by modifying our billing rates to our customers  which reduced revenues by approximately  and operating expenses by approximately  at the end of fiscal year  there was a charge to profit of  for a bonus payment to our employees that was not recovered in our billing rates to our customers 
allowance for bad debt 
since the majority of our revenues are generated from the us government  we regard the credit risk of our business to be minimal 
we record allowances for bad debt as a reduction to accounts receivable and an increase to bad debt expense 
these allowances are recorded in the period a specific collection problem is identified 
once the receivable is deemed uncollectible  the allowance is reversed and the receivable is written off 
at october   and  there was no balance for the allowance for doubtful accounts 
there was no charge to bad debt expense during fiscal year and during fiscal year  we recorded approximately  to bad debt expense 
inventory valuation and disposal 
we provide advanced digital signal processing products and systems to the us government 
typical life cycles of our equipment are eight to ten years or more 
in addition  we maintain spare parts in order to repair the equipment 
we evaluate our inventory quarterly  at interim reporting periods  and assess our ability to sell our equipment  which includes raw materials 
historically  we have sold our inventory at full cost so there is limited decrement in valuation 
if it is determined that a product has reached the end of its life cycle or there is no longer a need for certain equipment  the remaining inventory is disposed 
historically  we dispose of inventory at approximately the same time that the reduction to inventory is recorded and we do not hold inventory reserves 
the charges associated with disposed work in process and finished goods are included in contract costs in our statement of operations 
disposed raw material represents a minor amount and is included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations due to the fact that raw materials could be used in a variety of situations other than contract costs  including r d 
inventory activities during fiscal year and fiscal year included disposing of approximately  and  respectively  of obsolete products 
the disposed items included units in various stages of completion 
income taxes 
our income tax expense at interim reporting periods is based on an estimated effective tax rate 
this estimated tax rate is calculated based on the projected net income at the end of the fiscal year  and is reviewed at each reporting period 
at the end of the fiscal year  income tax expense is adjusted for actual results 
our effective tax rate can differ from the statutory rate  due to items such as expected benefits from r d credits and the reversals of valuation allowances 
price redetermination 
as a government contractor  we are subject to price redetermination on certain fixed price contracts if it is determined that we did not price our products and services consistent with the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations 
we did not incur any price redeterminations on any of our contracts during fiscal years   or  although we did settle an outstanding contract dispute relating to older contracts with the us government for approximately  this settlement did not result in a negative impact to our fiscal year earnings because the amount paid by us in settlement was fully reserved in prior years 
business combination 
in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocated the purchase price of dti to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation required management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management made estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates were based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of dti and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets included but were not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships  existing technologies  non compete agreements  patents  and trade name 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
goodwill valuation 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the current carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and loss of key personnel 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance as well as estimating discount rates 
based on our analysis  we concluded no impairment existed 
long lived asset valuation property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets 
we will test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability will be assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts  and  at the end of each period indicated  our backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income backlog thousands of dollars results revenues for fiscal year were  up from revenues of  recorded during fiscal year the acquisition of dynamics technology  inc dti was completed on july  this acquisition increased our revenue for the remaining four months of fiscal year by approximately million

in fiscal year  new orders increased  revenues increased  and ending backlog increased compared to fiscal year operating income increased during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year as a percentage of revenues due  in part  to the growth in revenues  and  in part  to an increase in program profitability generated from the sale of certain products 
however  the increase in our effective tax rate during fiscal year caused net income to decrease as a percentage of revenues when compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  new orders increased approximately  revenues increased  and ending backlog increased  when compared to fiscal year in addition  our operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenues 
the growth in revenue  in conjunction with controlled spending  led to a increase in net income during fiscal year over fiscal year revenues revenues were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
revenues increased by during fiscal year over fiscal year and by during fiscal year over fiscal year in fiscal year  revenues increased due to an overall increase in our business  including the acquisition of dti 
in addition  we increased our indirect rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as a result of absorbing the indirect rate variance 
the primary reason for the continued increase in revenues in recent years is an increase in engineering development efforts designed to provide a variety of global security solutions to the us government 
these solutions have helped to support the us government s global security counterterrorism efforts 
the following table identifies the source of our revenues as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal years   and by customer type fy fy fy intelligence agencies military law enforcement foreign commercial within the customer types  contracts with two intelligence agencies and one branch of the military represented a significant portion of revenues 
the table below identifies the revenue concentration as a percentage of total revenues from all contracts with each significant customer 
fy fy fy first intelligence agency second intelligence agency one branch of the military revenues from the us government can also be categorized as direct purchases and subcontracts  where we are the supplier to another contractor 
the following table distinguishes revenue concentration as a percentage of total revenues between those two categories 
fy fy fy direct purchases subcontracts cost reimbursement contracts typically do not return as high a profit margin as fixed price contracts  and accordingly  our profit margin will be affected by the mix of our orders by contract type 
four contracts represented an aggregate of of revenues for fiscal year  and three contracts represented an aggregate of and of revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
these contracts are all cost reimbursement contracts 
the following table represents our revenue concentration as a percentage of total revenues during the respective periods by contract type fy fy fy cost reimbursement contracts fixed price contracts new orders and backlog we received new orders of approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
new orders for fiscal year included a reduction of approximately million because the company completed negotiations of a stop work order related to a portion of its largest contract 
we estimate that our opportunity to generate revenues from this contract was reduced by approximately to million in fiscal year  by approximately to million in fiscal year  with the balance decreasing revenues expected for fiscal year fiscal year orders were significantly higher than fiscal year orders due to an increase in orders in connection with our largest contract occurring in fiscal year our backlog consists of the uncompleted portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options 
at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was  congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
reported backlog includes both funded and unfunded portions of contract values 
there is no assurance or obligation that contracts will be fully funded 
to the extent that contracts are not fully funded  there will be a reduction to backlog in a future period 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we conformed the treatment regarding approximately million of acquired  unfunded dti contracts and  as a result  added this amount to our backlog in accordance with our standard policy 
the fiscal year backlog represent s a decrease to fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was  representing a increase to fiscal year contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs incurred in the performance of contracts  including labor  materials  and overhead costs 
contract costs were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year the increase in our contract costs  in absolute dollars  in fiscal year and fiscal year  was consistent with our revenue growth for those fiscal years 
as a percentage of revenues  contract costs fluctuated at insignificant rates between fiscal years and research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through billing rates and expenditures funded by us from operations 
research and development expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year r d expenses grew in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues due to management s decision to return r d spending as a percentage of projected revenues to levels comparable to our long term business model 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to marketing and proposal activities  costs related to product warranties  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year in fiscal year  general and administrative expenses increased due to costs associated with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  and additional staff needed to support our revenue growth 
the cost associated with the internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act was approximately million in fiscal year in fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as compared to fiscal year due to our ability to support sign ificant revenue growth without proportionately increasing general and administrative activities 
in fiscal year  we recorded approximately  of amortization expense related to the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dti 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net for fiscal year was approximately  compared to approximately  and  of interest income in fiscal years and  respectively 
fiscal year included an increase of interest income of approximately  due to the increase of cash and investment balances over the first nine months of fiscal year interest income in fiscal year was slightly higher than fiscal year due to increases in cash and investment balances 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal year was approximately  compared to approximately  and  of interest expense in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest expense increased in fiscal year primarily due to interest payments and accruals of approximately  related to our million term loan entered into in connection with the acquisition of dti 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal years and resulted in income tax expense of approximately  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal years and are approximately and  respectively 
the increase in our tax rate from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily related to the increase in our state effective tax rate 
as a result of our acquisition of dti  we incorporated dti s net deferred tax assets of approximately million which are related to dti s net operating loss nol 
the dti nol carried forward is limited each year as to its utilization against our taxable income pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
however  while there is a yearly limitation on utilization of the nol  there is no reduction in the total amount of the nol that may be recognized and eventually utilized in the carry forward years 
the nol acquired as of july  was generated as a result of the compensation expense incurred due to the acceleration of unvested common stock options by dti immediately prior to the acquisition 
the nol was approximately million and million for federal and state purposes  respectively 
the federal and state nol acquired from dti will be carried forward for up to twenty years to offset future taxable i ncome 
as of october   we have determined that our stated deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in future periods and  therefore  we have not provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
the future use of the net deferred tax asset will not result in effective tax rate benefits because the asset has been accounted for in the purchase of dti 
in addition  we acquired income tax receivables from dti of approximately  due to an approximately million carryback of dti net operating losses against previously taxed dti income 
our income tax expense included the reversal of our valuation allowance of approximately  on our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was originally recorded in fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal year  we concluded  based on our evaluation of all the criteria outlined in the applicable accounting literature  that our deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized 
therefore  the remainder of our valuation allowance was reversed in that period 
the effective tax rate at the end of fiscal year was and differs from the federal statutory rate due to the reduction of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was reduced in the fourth quarter due to the availability of potential carryback refunds for taxes paid in fiscal year analysis of liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during fiscal year were the cash flows generated from operations and the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plans 
cash by operating activities 
net cash from operating activities has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
net cash provided was approximately   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories held by us  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net income for fiscal year was approximately  a decrease of  from fiscal year that was due  primarily  to the decrease in operating income in fiscal year as well as an increase in income tax expense 
accounts receivable balances increased by approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the change in accounts receivable activity between the fiscal years reflects higher sales in fiscal year versus fiscal year and a growth in fiscal year revenue compared to fiscal year inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets increased by approximately  in fiscal year  decreased by approximately  in fiscal year  and increased by approximately  in fiscal year the increase in inventory activities from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily the result of writing off approximately  of obsolete products in fiscal year  offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets by approximately  during the same period 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances increased in fiscal years   and by approximately   and  respectively 
fiscal year accrued payroll liabilities increased by approximately  over fiscal year due  primarily  to the increase in staffing  offset by a lower bonus accrual in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year accrued bonus expense at the end of fiscal year was approximately  which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year fiscal year accrued bonus was approximately  other accrued liabilities decreased by approximately  in fiscal year primarily due to the payment of  to the us government in settlement of a contract dispute over certain older contracts 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal years   and was approximately   and  respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we acquired dti for approximately million in cash  plus an estimated million in transaction costs 
we acquired cash of approximately  from dti 
during fiscal year  we purchased approximately  in available for sale securities  while approximately  matured 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the board of directors approved a change in our investment policy to include tax exempt securities 
in addition  investing activities for fiscal year included property and equipment purchases of approximately  primarily to support the increase in our staff and facilities 
in fiscal year  we received proceeds of approximately  from our available for sale securities  which was partially offset by purchases of approximately  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we adopted an investment policy with a shorter average maturity date for our investment securities  resulting in the sale of longer term securities  and the purchase of shorter term securities and cash equivalents 
in addition  investing activities for fiscal year included property and equipment purchases of approximately  primarily to support the increase in our staff 
cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the source of cash from financing activities during fiscal year were the million term loan from wells fargo and the purchase of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the source of cash from financing activities during fiscal years and was from the purchase of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the primary fluctuation between financing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year is the million term loan that we obtained from wells fargo bank during the third quarter of fiscal year for the acquisition of dti 
the plan for dividend payments in fiscal year was the same as fiscal year  at per share per annum 
dividend payments in fiscal year were approximately  and fiscal year dividend payments were approximately  cash is generated primarily from operating activities  employee stock activities  and investing activities 
we believe the primary risk to liquidity is the potential decrease in demand for our products and services 
historically  this demand has been influenced by the needs of the united states intelligence community 
we believe that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and the amount available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
borrowing arrangements revolving line of credit 
at october  we had a revolving line of credit the line of credit under which wells fargo bank  national association the bank  will advance funds to us from time to time up to and including march   not to exceed at any time the maximum principal amount of million 
under the line of credit  we had three standby letters of credit totaling approximately  one letter of credit  related to our facilities lease  had an outstanding balance of approximately  at october  and october  the second letter of credit was a requirement of our workers compensation insurance  and the outstanding balance was approximately  at october  and october  the third letter of credit  obtained in may  as a requirement of one of our customers  had an outstanding balance of approximately  at october  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s reference rate at october  and interest on those borrowings are payable monthly 
no fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
as security for its indebtedness under the line of credit  we have granted to the bank a security interest in our cash and marketable securities maintained with an affiliate of the bank 
term loan and interest rate swap 
effective july   and in connection with the acquisition of dti  we entered into a term loan with wells fargo bank  national association the bank  in the principal amount of million  plus interest  the proceeds of which were used for acquisition financing the term loan 
the term loan bears interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to above the london inter bank offered rate libor at october  
our term loan is for a seven year term ending on july  payment terms of the loan agreement include monthly payments of principal and interest 
as security for our indebtedness under the term loan  we have granted to the bank a security interest in our accounts receivable  general intangibles  inventory  and equipment 
we are required to maintain certain financial covenants setting forth minimum ratios for quick ratio and fixed charge coverage and maximum ratios for total liabilities to tangible net worth 
as of october   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on the term loan  and manage this exposure through the use of an interest rate swap agreement with the bank  designated as a cash flow hedge 
by locking in a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan  this strategy decreases the variability of earnings and cash flows resulting from interest rate fluctuations and lowers the overall borrowing costs should interest rates rise 
the interest rate swap  is considered a cash flow hedge and is governed by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas at october  we had one interest rate swap agreement outstanding  with the bank  designated as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
related to the company s million term loan 
no losses on the agreement due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated 
under this swap  we pay a fixed interest rate of over the seven year term of the loan and receive an average floating rate of libor on the notional amount of the loan 
the combined interest amounts on the term loan and the swap reflect our total monthly interest obligation which is fixed at 
the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is reported as other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
at october   the effective portion of the cash flow hedge was a deferred gain of approximately  over the next twelve months  we expect to reclassify approximately  of the gain to interest expense as principle on the term loan is repaid and the related swap instrument notional amount is reduced 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss  if there is one  impacts earnings as it occurs 
there is no ineffective portion of the outstanding swap as of october  contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands 
payments due by period fiscal year total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations term loan obligations purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations consist of non cancelable lease agreements for our facilities  which expire at various dates between fiscal years and certain leases contain escalation clauses and requirements for the payment of property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
new lease obligations during fiscal year were entered into as a result of the dti acquisition  opening a new facility in texas  and expanding our office in utah 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we renewed the lease for our office in virginia  that expired in january this obligation is included in the table above 
product warranties 
our products are warranted against defective workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the original purchaser 
warranty costs were approximately    and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  and  accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas the statement requires us to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and to record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosures regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective for us beginning the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and statement of cash flows 
we estimate that operating income could decrease by approximately to in future periods as a result of recording this additional expense 
the two transition methods allowed are the retrospective transition or the prospective transition 
we intend to adopt the sfas r standard using the modified prospective method of transition  whereby compensation cost will be recognized for new awards granted and awards modified  repurchased  and cancelled after november   and for the unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding at november  at their respective grant date fair value as the remaining requisite service is rendered 
the two major model alternatives are the lattice model or the black scholes model 
we will be using the black scholes option pricing model in determining the fair value of the stock options for our stock based compensation disclosures 
key assumptions for this option pricing model include the expected term of the option  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of the option s fair value and  hence  the related compensation expense 
an increase in the expected term of the option  stock price volatility and or risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs  or sfas sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material  and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact for fiscal year on june   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of statement will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
