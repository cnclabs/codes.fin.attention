gross profit our gross profit does not include fulfillment costs and costs related to the distribution network which are included in selling  general and administrative costs  and may not be comparable to the gross profit of other entities which do include such costs 
some entities may classify such costs as a component of cost of sales

these increases were offset by a million decrease in margin related to higher product costs and disposal of perishable and low carb products 
gross profit for the beverage segment decreased million in fiscal primarily due to the incremental sales from tsi acquired in june that contributed approximately million of gross profit and were offset by negative gross margin at hnwc of million due to lower selling prices in an attempt to increase market share

at hnwc  a reporting unit in the beverage segment  goodwill  customer list  tradename and certain long lived assets were determined to be impaired in the amounts of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the goodwill and intangible impairments and impairment of certain long lived assets recorded in the beverage and retail segments were ultimately the result of projected shortfalls in operating cash flow necessary to support the reporting units carrying value  and in the case of the beverage segment  the need for additional capital resources that  after the termination of the letter of intent discussed in note  did not appear likely 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist using the expected present value of the discounted future cash flows and consideration of the net recoverable values 
the addition of tsi in june added an incremental million of additional operating expenses in fiscal  excluding the impairment charges previously discussed 
other increases where in the wholesale segment which experienced an increase of million in professional fees due to utilization of professional service firms to explore strategic alternatives for the retail and beverage segments  work towards sarbanes oxley compliance and restatement of the company s financial statements

the company experienced a reduction of expenses of million related to rent expense and professional fees incurred in fiscal associated with a warehouse formerly used by the discontinued health food distribution business when the subtenant of the warehouse defaulted on the rental agreement 
no corresponding expense was incurred in fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal year increased to million compared to million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increases in the prime lending rate during the periods which  under the terms of the amended and restated credit facility  is the rate at which the company primarily borrows 
on average  the company s borrowing rates on its variable rate debt were higher and average borrowings were million higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal borrowings were higher in fiscal in large part due to the million of debt related to the acquisition of tsi in june and nesco hawaii in july other during fiscal  other income decreased million as compared to fiscal because of the sale of available for sale securities in fiscal that did not recur in during fiscal  minority interest in loss  net of tax  due to the ownership of tsi that is not owned by amcon  remain unchanged compared to fiscal however  losses were not allocated after the remaining minority interest was reduced to zero in fiscal as a result of the cumulative losses of tsi 
the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to valuation allowances placed on state net operating losses and impairment of non deductible intangible assets in fiscal which reduced the income tax benefit and related effective tax rate 
in fiscal  impairment of non deductible intangible assets increased the effective income tax rate 
during fiscal  the company paid preferred dividends of million on its series a and b  cumulative  convertible preferred stock  compared to million in fiscal discontinued operations effective march   the company s subsidiary  the beverage group  inc  ceased on going operations due to recurring losses since its december inception 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million during fiscal a charge of million  before taxes  was included in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal representing the adjustment of accounts receivable and inventory to their net realizable values and to write off fixed assets

these increases were offset by a million decrease in cigarette sales related to a decrease in prices on philip morris and a permanent decrease on rj reynolds successor in merger to brown williamson brands which began in the second quarter of the million increase in sales of tobacco  confectionary and other products was attributable primarily to sales to new customers in our current market area 
sales from the retail health food segments new oklahoma city store  which opened in april  were million 
sales declined in the remaining stores by million primarily because of the extreme adverse weather in florida  a planned elimination of the deli operation in the florida stores  reduced supplement sales resulting from unfavorable media coverage related to the government ban on ephedra based products and a general softening of the low carb market coupled with continued expansion of low carb offerings and sales through mainstream grocery channels 
the beverage segment accounted for million of sales for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the improvement was due to increases in case volume of our hawaiian springs natural spring water  which was possible due to completion of plant construction and a change to a new distributor in the hawaii market in october in addition  the acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of trinity springs  ltd 
at the end of june contributed million of sales for fiscal hawaiian natural water company hnwc  also acquired a water bottling operation on the island of oahu that contributed million of sales in fiscal this acquisition enabled hnwc to more effectively differentiate the premium natural spring water from purified bottled water products and provides a more competitive price point in which to provide private label water 
additionally  there were no sales from our home and office bottling and delivery business in hawaii for fiscal because it was sold in october sales from the home and office bottling and delivery business totaled million in fiscal gross profit our gross profit does not include fulfillment costs and costs related to the distribution network which are included in selling  general and administrative costs  and may not be comparable to those of other entities 
some entities may classify such costs as a component of cost of sales

in the beverage segment  cost of sales includes the cost of the raw materials and related factory labor and manufacturing overhead costs required to convert raw materials into finished goods  including  labor  depreciation and utilities 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year compared to for fiscal gross profit by business segment is as follows dollars in millions incr decr wholesale distribution segment retail health food stores segment beverage segment gross profit of million was generated from our wholesale distribution business from cigarette price increases implemented during fiscal in response to the elimination of vendor program incentive payments that the company historically received 
because vendor program incentive payments are generally received and recognized by the company in the quarter following the period in which the related cigarette sales were made  as that is when it is estimable  gross profit for fiscal includes both the normal vendor program incentive payments relating to the fourth quarter but received during the first quarter of approximately million  and the amount earned from the price increases that were implemented to replace vendor program incentive payments 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of million in incentive payments received on our private label cigarettes  a decrease in incentive allowances received from manufacturers of approximately million net of amounts paid to customers  a decrease of million related to increases in cigarette excise taxes in certain states in fiscal and a million larger charge to cost of sales for fiscal as compared to the fiscal related to the change in the required lifo inventory reserve balance 
the remainder of the increase in gross profit of million was primarily due to increased sales in all other products to new customers 
gross profit from our retail health food segment decreased million to million primarily due to the decreased sales discussed above 
gross profit from our beverage segment was consistent with the prior year 
the increase in sales produced additional gross profit of million which was offset by a decrease of million in gross profit from our home and office bottling and delivery business in hawaii which was sold in october operating expense operating expense includes selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization and impairment charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs and cost of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most significant expenses relate to employee costs  facility and equipment leases  transportation costs  insurance and professional fees 
total operating expense  which includes selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and impairment charges increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  total operating expenses increased to from as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses in the beverage segment accounted for million of the increase  primarily due to impairment of intangibles of million discussed below and expenses associated with tsi which was acquired in june and the water bottling operation acquired by hnwc in july operating expense in the beverage segment in fiscal included million associated with writing down nonoperating assets held for sale to their fair market value 
the wholesale distribution segment reduced operating costs by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in the required allowance for bad debt reserve that is calculated based on historical collection trends 
total operating expenses in our retail segment increased million due to the opening of a new store in oklahoma city 
these expenses were partially offset by savings incurred as a result of a reduced emphasis on the deli operations in the florida stores 
in addition  the company incurred million of rent expense and professional fees associated with a warehouse formerly used by the discontinued health food distribution business when the subtenant of the warehouse defaulted on the rental agreement 
as a result of the company s annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment review as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company determined that certain intangible assets in the beverage segment were impaired by million 
due to competitive pressures in the natural spring water bottling business  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected for the year 
based on this trend  future expected cash flows were revised for this reporting unit and an impairment was recorded and is included in operating expenses 
as a result of the above  the operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million as compared to operating income of million in fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal year increased to million compared to million during the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to additional borrowings on the company s revolving line to support the beverage bottling operations 
the impact of the increased borrowings was somewhat offset by lower average interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal other other income for fiscal of million was generated primarily from gains on sales of available for sale securities  as well as  interest income  dividends and royalty payments 
other income for fiscal of million was generated primarily from million received from a settlement related to a former distribution facility  million from gains on sales of available for sale securities  and million in interest on income tax refunds  as well as  interest income and dividends on investment securities 
the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in net operating loss carryforwards which resulted from new irs guidance issued in december allowing additional carryover of net operating losses related to acquired companies 
in fiscal  minority interest net of tax totaled million and represented the allocation of the current years net loss of tsi to the minority shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources overview operating activities 
the company requires cash to pay its operating expenses  purchase inventory and make capital investments and acquisitions of businesses 
in general  the company finances these cash needs from the cash flow generated by its operating activities  issuance of preferred stock  and from borrowings  as necessary 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash from operating activities  primarily due to reduced cigarette inventory levels resulting from a reduced lifo buy in at year end and income tax refunds received 
our variability in cash flows from operating activities is heavily dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  in the circumstance where we are buying in to obtain favorable terms on particular products or to maintain our lifo layers  we may have to retain the inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates cash outflow from operating activities that we expect to reverse in a later period 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our busiest time of the year  we generally carry larger inventory back stock to ensure high fill rates to maintain customer satisfaction 
our inventory levels are usually at their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters but at any given month can vary based on the day of the week that month end occurs 
we generally experience reductions in inventory levels during the first fiscal quarter  as compared to our fiscal year end  and maintain these levels until the beginning of the third fiscal quarter when we begin building for increased warm weather business 
investing activities 
cash of million was utilized in investing activities during fiscal for capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of a building and the construction of an addition so that we could relocate one of our wholesale distribution facilities 
a significant portion of the cash flows used in investing activities were financed through the real estate term debt discussed below 
financing activities 
the company used net cash of million from financing activities during fiscal cash of million was used in financing activities during fiscal to pay down revolving lines of credit totaling million used to fund our beverage segment  million in subordinated debt in the retail segment and other long term debt totaling million 
during fiscal  million was used to pay dividends on preferred stock and million was used to pay for costs incurred to amend and restate our revolving credit facility 
these uses of cash from financing activities were offset by borrowings of million on bank credit agreements and other short and long term debt arrangements and receipt of million from the private placement of series b convertible preferred stock net of costs incurred to issue the securities 
cash on hand working capital 
as of september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million 
this compares to cash on hand of million and a working capital deficit of million as of september the evaluation of the company s working capital is significantly impacted by the classification of the revolving credit facility as a short term obligation in september and treatment as long term in fiscal this classification change is due to an amendment to the credit agreement which now includes a springing lockbox provision which results in accounting for the debt associated with the credit agreement as long term in fiscal  except for the portion expected to be paid off during the next twelve months 
the company s ratio of debt to equity increased significantly as a result of the significant net loss which decreased shareholder equity 
for purposes of this calculation  series a and series b preferred stock and other long term liabilities the water royalty are excluded 
the company s maximum revolving credit limit on the facility was million at september  however the amount available for use at any given time is subject to many factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances that are evaluated on a daily basis 
on september   the balance on the facility was million  excluding term note a  and the amount available to borrow based on our collateral and loan limit was approximately million 
excluding term note a  our peak borrowing was million  our average borrowing was million and our average availability was million in fiscal our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels go up because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on the collateralized assets 
additional demands for capital 
funds generated from operations  supplemented as necessary with funds available under the facility have historically provided sufficient liquidity for operation of the wholesale and retail businesses 
in april  management negotiated the inclusion of tsi into the company s revolving credit facility which has incrementally increased collateral by million 
however  tsi still required additional capital resources and as a result  had to look to alternative sources of financing 
this included subordinated loans of  issued on august  with a maturity of december   of which  was from aristide investment  lp  a california limited partnership of which  william f 
wright  the company s chairman of the board  chief executive officer and largest stockholder  is a partner 
the other  was from draupnir  llc  a delaware limited liability company of which  allen petersen and jeremy w 
hobbs  two of the company s directors  are members 
these temporary loans were made available to tsi to provide time for the special committee  composed of independent  disinterested members of the company s board of directors  to explore strategic alternatives and evaluate wright group s proposed acquisition 
one of the matters delegated by the board of directors to the special committee was to explore the feasibility of obtaining additional equity or mezzanine capital for investment in the healthy edge  inc which was planned to be an intermediate holding company for the subsidiaries conducting the retail health food and beverage segments 
the special committee considered a potential spin off of at least of the stock of the healthy edge  inc to the company s stockholders but additional capital was necessary to make that alternative viable 
because the additional capital did not materialize  the sale of some or all of the businesses constituting the retail health food and beverage segments became the only principal strategic alternative pursued by the special committee with assistance from its financial adviser 
because our credit agreement contains restrictions for funding of certain subsidiaries and the fact that the sale transaction of the retail health food and beverage subsidiaries was terminated in january due to complications associated with the tsi acquisition  the beverage subsidiaries were placed in dire need of additional capital in order to fund operations 
no such funding was received and as of march  the company discontinued tsi operations 
hnwc  which owns nesco  continues to manufacture product and is sustaining operations through operating cash flows  but continues to be strained in meeting its day to day obligations 
recent developments issuance of series c convertible preferred stock 
on march   the company issued and sold  shares of its series c convertible preferred stock at per share in a private placement under section of the securities act of the series c convertible preferred stock was issued and sold for the purpose of generating million to be applied as a repayment of principal under the company s secured credit facilities with lasalle bank national association 
cumulative cash dividends on the series c convertible preferred stock are payable in arrears at a rate of per annum when  as and if declared by our board of directors  on march  june  september and december of each year 
the series c convertible preferred stock is convertible by the holder at any time into shares of our company s common stock 
the series c convertible preferred stock currently is convertible into  shares of our company s common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments in the event of stock splits  stock dividends and certain other events with respect to our common stock 
dividend payments during the first quarter of fiscal  the board of directors suspended payment of cash dividends on our common shares for the foreseeable future 
the company will periodically revisit its dividend policy to determine whether it has adequate internally generated funds  together with other needed financing to fund its growth and operations in order to resume the payment of cash dividends on common stock 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations and commitments as of fiscal year end payments due by period contractual fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal obligations total thereafter credit facility    long term debt     related party debt   interest on long term and subordinated debt    operating leases        minimum water royalty   total        other commercial fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal commitments total thereafter lines of credit   lines of credit in use   lines of credit available   water source guarantee   letters of credit total    in october  the company s revolving credit facility was amended to increase the total facility to million and add the subsidiaries  except for trinity springs  inc  as borrowers

critical accounting estimates certain accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements require us to make judgments and estimates and the financial results we report may vary depending on how we make these judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a weekly basis and assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
for example  a customer in bankruptcy would indicate that an amount could be uncollectible 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that our current level of allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate at the balance sheet date and that our credit exposure is very low compared with the high volume of sales and the nature of our industry in which collections are generally made quickly 
however  for every percent of receivables deemed to require an additional reserve at september  the impact on the statement of operations would be to increase selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories consist primarily of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products that we carry to better serve our customers  there is a risk of impairment in inventory that is unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete or is discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
in addition  we may discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management s evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets that were acquired in business combinations 
fixed assets and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill is not amortized 
impairment of reporting units  which is measured in the company s fourth fiscal quarter in order to coincide with its budgeting process  is evaluated annually with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist 
the reporting units are valued using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
fiscal impairment during fiscal  based on valuations obtained from an independent valuation specialist  management determined that a portion of the tradenames and goodwill were impaired at both the retail and the beverage segments 
the impairments recorded in the beverage and retail segments were the result of projected shortfalls in operating cash flows necessary to support the reporting units carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist using the expected present value of the discounted future cash flows and consideration of the net recoverable values 
a summary of the impairment charges by entity for fiscal year are as follows in millions retail tsi hnwc total long lived assets goodwill water source customer list tradename the impairment charges are recorded in the company s statement of operations as a component of loss income from continuing operations 
fiscal impairment due to competitive pressures in the natural spring water bottling business  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected 
based on this trend  the future cash flow forecasts were revised for this reporting unit and an impairment of million to the hnwc tradename was recorded in the company s statement of operations as a component of income loss from operations 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist using the expected present value of the discounted future cash flows 
nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company s long lived assets 
in regard to the impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management s estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses used by the independent third party valuation specialist 
assumptions and approach used 
for fixed assets  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
in evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets we primarily use an income based approach discounted cash flow method and guideline public and private company information 
a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management s evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets and amortizable intangibles are appropriate 
if we shortened the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets by one year  the impact on the statement of operations for the current period would be to increase depreciation expense by approximately  a decrease in the estimate of future sales or increase of estimated expenses for reporting units evaluated for impairment could result in additional impairment of intangibles being recorded up to the amount of the carrying amount of the intangible assets which was approximately million as of september  insurance the company s insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on analysis and consultation with our third party administrator  our experience is such that we have a one month lag period in which claims are reported 
workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior year s loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we utilize the assistance of our insurance agent to trend and develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
our insurance agent uses standard insurance industry loss development models 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe that our current reserve for incurred but unreported insurance claims is adequate at the balance sheet date 
however  for every percent increase in claims  an additional reserve of approximately  would be required at september  the impact of which would increase selling  general and administrative expenses by that amount in the same period 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
during fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against state net operating loss carryforwards for the beverage and retail health companies in the consolidated group who have historically incurred losses and file separate state tax returns 
assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position historical financial information future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years tax planning strategies sensitivity analysis 
based on our analysis  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million was required at september the valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized and a corresponding reduction to net income resulted 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale and beverage segments when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when the products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts as part of our periodic evaluation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers based on volume 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 
sensitivity analysis 
based on the historical information used to estimate the reserves for sales discounts and volume sales incentives  we do not anticipate significant variances from the amounts reserved 
however  there could be significant variances from period to period based on customer make up and programs offered 
our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt 
at september  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding excluding million variable rate debt which is fixed through the swaps described below  with maturities through april the interest rate on this debt was at september we estimate that our annual cash flow exposure relating to interest rate risk based on our current borrowings is approximately million for each change in our lender s prime interest rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the libor interest rate borrowing option was removed  except for the portion of the loan that is related to the swap agreement as part of the revolving credit facility restructuring in october at september  the company has an interest rate swap agreement with a bank in order to mitigate the company s exposure to interest rate risk on this variable rate debt 
under the agreement  the company agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  fixed interest amounts for variable interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed upon notional principal amounts of million 
the interest rate swap effectively converts million of variable rate senior debt to fixed rate debt at a rate of on the million notional amount through the maturity of the swap agreements on june  this interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a hedge and is accounted for as such for financial accounting purposes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments other than the interest rate swap which could expose us to significant market risk
