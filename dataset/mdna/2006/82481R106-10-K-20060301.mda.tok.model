the targeted inventory strategy for xagrid is weeks of bulk  unlabeled or labeled supply 
replagal shire s hgt facility in cambridge  massachusetts is the single supplier of replagal 
duplication of this facility would be prohibitively expensive 
other shire s other products marketed in the us and canada are manufactured and packaged by third party contract manufacturers 
all products marketed by the international sales and marketing operation are either manufactured and supplied by the originator of the product under supply arrangements or are manufactured for shire by third parties under contract 
distribution shire s us distribution center  which includes a large vault to house dea regulated schedule ii products  is located in kentucky 
from there  the company distributes its products to all the wholesale distribution centers and the three major warehousing pharmacy chains that stock schedule ii drugs in the us  providing access to nearly all pharmacies in the us 
physical distribution in the uk  spain  italy  france  germany and the republic of ireland is contracted out to third parties and agency or distribution agreements are in place for other export territories where shire does not have local operations 
material customers the company s three largest trade customers are cardinal health inc  mckesson corp  and amerisource bergen corp  all of which are in the us 
in  these wholesale customers accounted for approximately   and of total product sales  respectively 
during  the company concluded new fee for service agreements with two of its three significant wholesale customers 
these agreements  which are commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry  change the way wholesalers are compensated 
under the agreements  the wholesalers receive a distribution fee from pharmaceutical suppliers 
these fee for service agreements eliminate wholesalers incentives to acquire and hold excess inventories 
the company believes this will reduce the significant impact of wholesaler stocking and de stocking on its product sales 
further  the wholesalers will provide data regarding their inventories of the company s products it has on hand 
the company is negotiating a fee for service agreement with its remaining significant wholesale customer 
fees for service are treated as a sales deduction  thus affecting revenues rather than cost of sales 
intellectual property an important part of the company s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents and trademarks  to the extent available 
the company also relies on trade secrets  unpatented know how  technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain and enhance its competitive position where it is unable to obtain patent protection or where marketed products are not covered by specific patents 
shire s commercial success will depend  in part  upon its ability to obtain and enforce strong patents  to maintain trade secret protection  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to comply with the terms of licenses granted to it 
the company s policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever possible in the us  canada  major european countries and japan 
where practicable  the company seeks patent protection in other countries on a selective basis 
in all cases the company endeavors to either obtain patent protection itself or support applications by its licensors 
in the regular course of business  shire s patents may be challenged by third parties 
shire is a party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
details of ongoing litigation are provided in item legal proceedings 
the degree of patent protection afforded to pharmaceutical inventions around the world is uncertain 
if patents are granted to other parties that contain claims having a scope that is interpreted by the relevant authorities to cover any of shire s products or technologies  there can be no guarantee that shire will be able to obtain licenses to such patents or make other arrangements at reasonable cost  if at all 
the existence  scope and duration of patent protection varies among the company s products and among the different countries where the company s products may be sold 
it may also change over the course of time as patents grant or expire  or become extended  modified or revoked 
the following list sets forth details of the granted us patents pertaining to the company s currently marketed products and major products under development  or technology relating to those products  which are owned by or licensed to the company and that are material to an understanding of the company s business taken as a whole 
the company also holds patents in other jurisdictions  such as the european union  canada and japan and has patent applications pending in such jurisdictions  as well as in the us

the company s sales of such product s may decrease in consequence 
in many cases  however  the company s products have more than one patent pertaining to them 
in such cases  or where the company enjoys trade secrets  manufacturing expertise  patient preference or regulatory exclusivity  the company may continue to market its own products without its commercial sales of those products being adversely affected by the loss of any given patent 
competition shire believes that competition in its markets is based on  among other things  product safety  efficacy  convenience of dosing  reliability  availability and price 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures than shire have a greater ability to fund the research and clinical trials necessary for regulatory applications  and consequently may have a better chance of obtaining approval of drugs that would then compete with shire s products 
other products now in use or being developed by others may be more effective or have fewer side effects than the company s current or future products 
the market share data provided below is sourced from ims 
adhd market competition in the us adhd market has continued to increase as several products that do or will compete with the company s products have been launched in recent years 
among the new entrants will be daytrana  the company s methylphenidate product  which is currently in registration 
many of these products contain methylphenidate 
in  johnson and johnson in conjunction with alza launched concerta  a once daily formulation of methylphenidate 
at december   concerta had a share of the us adhd market 
in  ucb pharma launched metadate cd  a once daily formulation of methylphenidate 
at december   metadate cd had a share of the us adhd market 
in  novartis in conjunction with elan launched ritalin la  an extended release formulation of methylphenidate  and in launched focalin xr in conjunction with celgene corporation celgene  a long acting formulation of dexmethylphenidate  the active ingredient of traditional methylphenidate preparations 
at december  ritalin and focalin xr had a and share  respectively  of the us adhd market 
in  barr laboratories inc barr launched a generic version of adderall ir 
subsequently  five additional generic companies have launched generic versions 
total adderall ir generic prescriptions account for about of the market as at december  in  eli lilly launched strattera  a non stimulant  non scheduled treatment for adhd 
at december   strattera had a share of the us adhd market 
the company s non stimulant product  spd  is in phase in  cephalon inc cephalon received an approvable letter from the fda to market sparlon for the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents aged cephalon has announced that it expects to launch sparlon during the second quarter of  subject to final fda approval 
also in  cephalon announced an agreement with the mcneil consumer and specialty pharmaceuticals division of mcneil ppc  inc  to co promote sparlon 
the company is also aware of clinical development efforts by gsk  gliatech inc  cortex pharmaceuticals inc  boehringer ingelheim  eisai inc  bristol myers squibb in collaboration with elan and abbott laboratories inc to develop additional indications and new non stimulant treatment options for adhd 
generic and other possible competition to the company s adhd franchise is separately discussed in intellectual property above  in risk factors below  and in item legal proceedings 
hiv market the hiv competitive landscape is becoming more crowded and complicated as treatment trends evolve 
tc epivir in the nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor nrti market of which tc epivir is a part  there are a number of anti hiv drugs which are currently sold 
of the branded drugs available  ziagen abacavir and retrovir zidovudine  each sold by gsk  zerit stavudine  dt and videx didanosine sold by bristol myers squibb bms  hivid zalcitabine sold by roche and viread tenofovir and emtriva emtricitabine  each sold by gilead sciences inc gilead  represent the most direct competition 
trizivir combivir epzicom in the combined nrti market of which trizivir  combivir and epzicom are a part  there is one major competitor truvada sold by gilead 
other hiv competition in addition to the two nrti hiv markets in which shire operates  there is competition from non nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis 
of the branded nnrtis available  sustiva efavirenz sold by bms and viramune nevirapine sold by boehringer ingelheim represent the most significant competition 
protease inhibitors pis 
of the branded pis available  agenerase amprenavir sold by gsk  reyataz atanavir sold by bms  citrivan indinavir sold by merck  kaletra iopinavir ritanaovir and norvir ritonovir sold by abbott  viracept nelfinavir sold by pfizer  fortovase saquinavir sold by roche and aptivus tipranavir sold by boehringer ingelheim represent the most significant competition 
fusion or entry inhibitors 
of the branded drugs available  fuzeon enfuvirtide  an injectable integrase inhibitor sold by roche trimeris  represents the most significant competition 
generic hiv competitors bms s videx ec didanosine became the first generic hiv product in the united states in gsk s retrovir azt came off patent in the us in september and its patent in europe expires in march although in september several generic formulations of zidovudine were approved by the fda  these generic competitors have yet to fully ramp up production and distribution 
as a result  the full effect of this on the overall market for hiv products is unknown  but price decreases for all hiv products may result 
government regulation the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of shire s products are subject to governmental regulation in the us  the eu and other territories 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act in the us  and numerous directives and guidelines in the eu govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of the company s products 
product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
regulatory approval is required in all the major markets in which shire  or its licensees  seek to test or market products 
at a minimum  such approval requires the evaluation of data relating to the quality  safety and efficacy of a product for its proposed use 
the specific types of data required and the regulations relating to this data will differ depending on the territory  the drug involved  the proposed indication and the stage of development 
in general  for a new chemical entity  the product needs to undergo rigorous preclinical testing 
clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical compound into healthy human volunteers  the emphasis is on testing for safety adverse effects  dosage tolerance  metabolism  distribution  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase ii involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical compound for specific targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks 
once a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii trials are undertaken to evaluate more fully clinical outcomes 
it is the company s responsibility to ensure that it conducts its business in accordance with the regulations of each relevant territory 
information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the approval process 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the quality  safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
there can be no assurance that  if clinical trials are completed  either the company or its collaborative partners will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and or market potential products including a marketing authorization application  nda or anda or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner  if at all 
in order to gain marketing approval the company must submit a dossier to the relevant regulatory authority for review 
the format is usually specific and laid out by each authority  although in general it will include information on the quality chemistry  manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non clinical and clinical data 
the fda undertakes the review for the us  in europe the review may be undertaken by members of the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp on behalf of the emea as part of a centralized procedure or by an individual country s agency  followed by mutual recognition of this review by a number of other countries agencies  depending on the process applicable to the drug in question 
approval can take from several months to several years  or be denied 
the approval process can be affected by a number of factors  additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs 
the agency may conduct an inspection of relevant facilities or review manufacturing procedures  operating systems and personnel qualifications 
in addition to obtaining approval for each product  in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved 
further inspections may occur over the life of the product 
an inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure 
as a condition of approval  the regulatory agency may require post marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects  or other additional studies as deemed appropriate 
after approval for the initial indication  further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications 
the terms of any approval  including labeling content  may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product 
in the us  the drug price competition and patent restoration term act of  known as the us hatch waxman act  established a period of marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs as well as abbreviated application procedures for generic versions of those drugs 
approval to manufacture these drugs is obtained by filing an anda 
as a substitute for conducting full scale pre clinical and clinical studies  the fda will accept data establishing that the drug formulation  which is the subject of an abbreviated application  is bio equivalent and has the same therapeutic effect as the previously approved drug  among other requirements 
european guidelines also allow for the submission of abridged applications using similar criteria to the us system 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
periodic marketing authorization renewals in europe may require additional data  which  if unfavorable  may result in an authoritization being withdrawn 
in the us  the fda has the authority to revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products  to prevent companies and individuals from participating in the drug approval process  to request recalls  to seize violative products  to obtain injunctions to close manufacturing plants not operating in conformity with regulatory requirements and to stop shipments of violative products 
the branch of the fda responsible for drug marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved products 
changes in government regulation could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
in recent years  in the us  various legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems 
some states have passed such legislation  and further federal and state proposals are possible 
such proposals and legislation include  and future proposals could include  price controls or patient access constraints on medicines and increases in required rebates or discounts 
similar issues exist in europe 
the company cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives  but will work to maintain patient access to its products and to oppose price constraints 
additionally  legislation is being debated at the federal level in the us that could allow patient access to drugs approved in other countries most notably canada 
this is generally referred to as drug re importation 
although there is substantial opposition to this potential legislation within areas of the federal government  including the fda  the company cannot predict the outcome of such legislative activities pertaining to drug re importation 
in the us  recent federal legislation has created substantial changes in the medicare program  including the december enactment of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act 
under this legislation  medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to obtain a medicare endorsed  drug discount card from a private sector provider through beginning in  medicare beneficiaries are able to purchase prescription drug coverage from a private sector provider 
it is difficult to predict the long term impact of this legislation on pharmaceutical companies 
usage of pharmaceutical products may increase as the result of expanded access to medications afforded by partial reimbursement under medicare 
however  such potential sales increases may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to enhanced purchasing power of the private sector that will negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries 
additionally  federal and state proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicaid program 
us law requires the company to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program 
rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without appreciable increases in shire s product sales volume as an offset 
the company must also give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
similar regulatory and legislative issues are encountered in europe and other international markets where governments regulate pharmaceutical prices and patient reimbursement levels 
the differing approach to price regulation has led to some third party trade in shire s products from markets with lower prices 
exploitation of price differences between countries in this way can impact sales in those markets with higher prices 
the us dea also controls the national production and distribution in the us of scheduled drugs ie those containing controlled substances by allocating production quotas based  in part  upon the dea s view of national demand 
as schedule ii drugs  the production and sale of shire s adhd products are strictly controlled 
new pharmaceutical legislation in the eu  enacted in november  has an impact on the procedures for authorization of pharmaceutical products in the eu 
a new decentralized drug review and authorization procedure has been added to the centralized and the mutual recognition procedures 
the new procedure provides an alternative authorization procedure to the mutual recognition procedure for those drugs that are ineligible for a centralized review 
requirements for the innovation in a drug therapy that must be present to be submitted under the centralized review procedure have been clarified as part of the revised regulation 
the new eu legislation also contains new data protection provisions 
all products will be subject to an exclusivity regime 
a generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product 
the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either ten or eleven years have elapsed from the date of grant of the initial marketing authorization 
the one year extension is available if the innovator obtains an additional indication during the first eight years of the marketing authorization that is of significant advancement in clinical benefit 
third party reimbursement the company s revenue depends  in part  upon the price third parties  such as health care providers and governmental organizations  are willing to reimburse patients for the cost of our  or our competitors  similar products and related treatment 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products and or seeking pharmaco economic data to justify their negotiated reimbursement prices 
in the us  several factors outside shire s control could significantly influence the sale prices of pharmaceutical products  including medicare part d  the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare  and the renewed focus on reducing costs in state medicaid and other government insurance programs 
for example  revisions or clarification from centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to state medicaid and other government reimbursement programs may have retroactive application which may result in changes to management s estimated rebate liability reported in a prior period 
at the time of sale  revenues from the company s products are reasonably estimable with the aid of historical trend analysis and consideration of any current period changes in pricing practices 
the rebates can be reasonably determinable at the time of sale to the initial customers 
these factors would not impact our revenue recognition policy under generally accepted accounting principles 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of established a voluntary drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries and created the new medicare part d 
medicare part d gives elderly and disabled people  already on medicare  access to prescription drug coverage starting in january the impact of part d on shire s portfolio is not expected to be material but will be monitored closely as the program evolves 
similar developments may take place in the eu markets  where the emphasis will likely be on price controls and non reimbursement for new and highly priced medicines for which the economic as well as the therapeutic rationales are not established 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available for any of shire s future product launches 
limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for the company s products 
price applications in europe have delayed product launches in some countries for up to two years and  as a consequence  dates for product launches and associated recognition of revenue cannot be predicted with accuracy 
corporate responsibility cr the company has further developed its approach to cr  with new members representing human resources  facilities  marketing  risk management and environmental health safety joining the cr committee

while the company aims to identify and manage such risks  no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss 
set out below are the key risk factors  generally associated with the business  that have been identified through the company s approach to risk management 
these risk factors apply equally to the company and  therefore  they should all be carefully considered before any investment is made in shire 
any decrease in the sales of adderall xr will significantly reduce revenues and earnings 
in  sales of adderall xr were million  representing approximately of the company s revenues 
any factors that decrease sales of adderall xr will significantly reduce revenues and earnings and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these include issues impacting the production of adderall xr or the supply of amphetamine salts  development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals  including generic versions  technological advances including the approval of new competing products for adhd treatments  loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent the company s patents see item of this form k for details of current patent litigation  changes in reimbursement policies of third party payers  government action intervention  marketing or pricing actions by competitors  public opinion towards adhd treatments  any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention  product liability claims  or changes in prescription writing practices 
any decrease in the sales of tc could significantly reduce revenues and earnings 
the company receives royalties from gsk on the worldwide sales of tc 
in  the company s royalty income for tc sales was million  representing approximately of total revenues 
this income stream generates a larger proportion of net income relative to the company s own product sales as there are minimal costs associated with this income 
any factors that decrease sales of tc by gsk could significantly reduce the company s revenues and earnings 
these include reduction in production of tc  development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals  technological advances  loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents  government action intervention  marketing or pricing actions by gsk s competitors  any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention  public opinion towards aids treatments  or product liability claims 
future revenues from product sales will be impacted by the commercial success of the company s new products 
the commercial success of the company s new products will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians  patients and other key decision makers  as well as the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals  the scope of marketing approval as reflected in the product s label  the countries in which such approvals are obtained  the acceptance of price in those countries where price is negotiated  and safety  efficacy  convenience  and cost effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products 
if the company is unable to commercialize these products successfully  there may be an adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues 
the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are large  well known pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications 
they may also be more successful than the company in licensing new products for development and commercialization 
further  they may also have an improved likelihood of obtaining approval of drugs that may compete with those marketed or under development by the company 
if any product that competes with one of the company s principal drugs is approved  the company s sales of that drug could fall 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change 
the company s products could  therefore  be rendered obsolete or uneconomical  through the development of new products  technological advances in manufacturing  or production by its competitors 
the failure to obtain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payers in a timely manner for certain of the company s products may impact future revenues 
the prices for certain of the company s products when commercialized  including  in particular  products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
the company may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for products likely to have a high annual cost of therapy 
the failure to obtain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect revenues 
a disruption to the product supply chain may result in the company being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the company being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis 
the company has its own manufacturing capability for certain products and has also entered into supply agreements with third party contract manufacturers 
in the event of either the company s failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards cgmp in the countries in which the company intends to sell or have its products sold  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop products 
the company dual sources certain key products and their active ingredients 
this has been a key goal of the company s supply chain function in recent years 
however  there is currently reliance on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of replagal  carbatrol  agrylin  xagrid  reminyl  dynepo  ga gcb and elaprase and reliance on a single active ingredient source for each of pentasa  replagal  fosrenol  agrylin and reminyl 
there is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms  or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements 
the company also has its own warehousing and distribution capability for certain products and has entered into distribution agreements with third party distributors for certain services 
the failure of either the company s or a third party s service could result in the company being unable to continue to distribute its products 
the development and approval of the company s products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities 
as the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications  regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the need to qualify a new supplier could delay the company s development and commercialization efforts 
the company uses bovine derived serum sourced from canada and the united states in some of its manufacturing processes 
the discovery of additional cattle in either canada or the united states with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or mad cow disease  could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on certain of the company s products  or prohibit the company from using its products at all in such countries 
fluctuations in wholesale buying patterns may influence net sales and growth comparisons 
a significant portion of product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the united states and europe 
consequently  product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions  or other factors 
in the event of financial failure of certain customers  the company may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues 
in the us  the company s significant trade customers include mckesson corp  cardinal health inc  and amerisource bergen corp 
for the fiscal year to december   the three largest trade customers  mckesson corp  cardinal health inc  and amerisource bergen corp  accounted for approximately   and of product sales  respectively 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the actions of certain customers can affect the company s ability to sell or market products profitably 
a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the us and uk markets 
in  for example  approximately of the company s product sales were attributable to three customers 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred 
consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels  or otherwise reduce purchases of the company s products 
such actions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the actions of governments  industry regulators and the economic environments in which it operates  may adversely affect the company s ability to develop and market its products profitably 
changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry  which are made in any country in which the company conducts its business  may adversely impact the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation 
changes in the general economic conditions in any of the company s major markets may also affect the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the company by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceuticals 
changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the cost of treatment established by health care providers  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this  in turn  could impact on the prices at which the company can sell its products 
the market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following  which could result in lower prices for the company s products and or a reduced demand for the company s products the ongoing trend toward managed health care  particularly in the united states  legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs in many of the company s markets  and price controls and non reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established 
in the united states  a law reform proposal currently under consideration by the us senate  the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of  would allow the re importation into the united states of prescription drugs from specified countries  including canada and countries in the european union  within a year of its enactment 
passage of this law reform proposal has the potential to increase greatly the rate of parallel importation into the united states 
parallel importation occurs when an importer finds a cheaper price for a product or equivalent product on the world market and imports that product from the lower price jurisdiction to the higher price jurisdiction 
if the parallel importation of lower priced drugs is permitted in the united states  it could have the effect of reducing sales of equivalent drugs in the united states 
to the extent that parallel importation increases  the company may receive less revenue from its commercialized products 
the enactment of the proposed legislation could accordingly have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in europe  the parallel importation of prescription drugs is permitted in some circumstances 
if the company s projects or clinical trials for the development of products are unsuccessful  its products will not receive authorization for manufacture and sale 
due to the complexity of the formulation and development of pharmaceuticals  the company cannot be certain that it will successfully complete the development of new products  or  if successful  that such products will be commercially viable 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development  the company must demonstrate through clinical and other studies that the product is of appropriate quality and is safe and effective for the claimed use 
clinical trials of any product under development may not demonstrate the quality  safety and efficacy required to result in an approvable or a marketable product 
failure to demonstrate adequately the quality  safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  regulatory authorities in europe  the united states  canada or other countries including the fda in the united states  the emea in the european union  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the uk and health canada in canada may require additional studies  which could result in a increased costs and significant development delays  or b termination of a project if it would no longer be economically viable 
the completion rate of clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  obtaining adequate clinical supplies and recruiting patients 
delays in patient enrolment in clinical trials may also result in increased costs and program delays 
additional delays can occur in instances in which the company shares control over the planning and execution of product development with collaborative partners 
the company cannot be certain that  if clinical trials are completed  either the company or its collaborative partners will file for  or receive  required authorizations to manufacture and or market potential products in a timely manner 
if the company is unable to meet the requirements of regulators in relation to a particular product  it may be unable to develop the product or obtain or retain the necessary marketing approvals 
drug companies are required to obtain regulatory approval before manufacturing and marketing most drug products 
regulatory approval is generally based on the results of quality testing chemistry  manufacturing and controls  non clinical testing  and clinical testing 
the clinical development  manufacture  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation  including separate regulation by each country in the european union  the european union itself and federal  state and local regulation in the united states 
unanticipated legislative and other regulatory actions and developments concerning various aspects of the company s operations and products may restrict its ability to sell one or more of its products or to sell those products at a profit 
the generation of data is regulated and any generated data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
required regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  other regulatory requirements for any such proposed products may not be met 
even if the company obtains regulatory approvals  the terms of any product approval  including labeling  may be more restrictive than desired and could affect the marketability of its products 
regulatory authorities have the power to  amongst other things revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products  require the recall of products that fail to meet regulatory requirements  and close manufacturing plants that do not operate in conformity with good manufacturing practices and or other regulatory requirements or approvals 
such delays or actions could affect the company s ability to manufacture and sell its products 
the failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue 
the company enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing 
in these partnerships  the company is dependent on its partner to deliver results 
while these partnerships are supported by contracts  the company does not exercise direct control 
if a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties  the company may suffer a reduction in sales or royalties or may experience delays in approval of products 
the failure to secure new products or compounds for development  either through in licensing  acquisition or internal research and development efforts  may have an adverse impact on the company s future results 
the company s future results will depend  to a significant extent  upon its ability to in license  acquire or develop new products or compounds for development 
the failure to in license or acquire new products or compounds  on a commercially viable basis  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company also expends significant resources on research and development 
the failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may fail to obtain  maintain  enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business 
the company s success depends upon its ability and the ability of its collaborators and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights 
where possible  the company s strategy is to register intellectual property rights  such as patents and trademarks 
the company also relies variously on trade secrets  unpatented know how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position 
patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the company have been granted  or are pending in various countries  including the united states  canada  major european countries and japan 
the company intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its collaborators intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the company 
however  patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing  using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company s products or technologies or processes for formulating or manufacturing similar or functionally equivalent products 
the company s patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn 
the company cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the company s products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged  revoked  invalidated  infringed or circumvented by third parties 
in the regular course of business  the company is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for further information 
additionally  the company s products  or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may  now  or in the future  infringe the patent rights of third parties 
it is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development  manufacture or sale of the company s products 
if third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology  it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the company or its strategic collaborators from developing  manufacturing or selling its products 
the company may need to obtain licences for intellectual property rights from others to develop  manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licences on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other un patented proprietary information  which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
if the company s employees  scientific consultants or collaborators develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the company s products under development  such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company s property  but may remain the property of those persons or their employers 
protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the company s proprietary rights 
the failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the company s product sales 
the company has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with pharmaceuticals and biologics in various countries including the united states and countries in europe and latin america and intends to trademark new product names as new pharmaceuticals and services are developed 
in addition  with respect to certain products  the company relies on the trademarks of third parties 
these trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the company or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks 
the company s inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the company s trademarks and dilute their value 
if a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects  this could result in damage to the company s reputation  the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the company 
the company s ability to sell any pharmaceutical products after the receipt of regulatory approval will depend on the acceptance of those products by physicians and patients 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of the company s products  or those of its competitors  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products 
future results of operations will also depend on continued market acceptance of current products and the lack of substitutes that are cheaper or more effective 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and selling of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims  product recalls  litigation and associated adverse publicity 
the cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited 
a successful product liability claim against the company could require the company to pay a substantial monetary award 
if  in the absence of insurance  the company does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim  it could become insolvent 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
although the company carries product liability insurance  this coverage may not be adequate 
in addition  it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will continue to be available 
moreover  an adverse judgment in a product liability suit  even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal  could generate substantial negative publicity about the company s products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products 
monitoring or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies in the highly regulated markets in which the company operates may result in the distraction of senior management  significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines 
the company engages in various marketing  promotional and educational activities pertaining to  as well the sale of  pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world 
the promotion  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants  such as the company  are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  including the fda  the us department of justice and the dea in the us 
any inquiries or investigations into the operations of  or enforcement or other regulatory action against  the company by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time  significant defense costs and substantial monetary penalties 
the outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third parties  the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the company s business and to develop and market products 
the company has entered into many agreements with third parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business 
if the third party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis  the company may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis 
additionally  it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers 
the company has also entered into licensing and co development agreements with a number of parties 
there is a risk that  upon expiration or termination of a third party agreement  the company may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party as commercial interests may no longer coincide 
in such circumstances  the company may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line 
loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the company subsequent financial loss 
the company faces intense competition for highly qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
it may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel 
the company has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less 
the loss of such personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for its activities  could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in the event of breakdown  failure or breach of security on any of the company s it systems  the company may be unable to maintain its business operations 
the company operates several complex information systems upon which it is dependent 
the company has backup procedures and disaster recovery plans in place to enable the business to continue its normal operations and to mitigate any loss in the event of a failure 
however  in the event of breakdown  failure or breach of security of any of these systems or the associated suppliers  the company may be unable to maintain its business operations 
this could lead to loss of revenue and delay in product development 
in addition  the company is in the process of installing enterprise wide information systems in its operations throughout the world 
any failure in the operation of this system could have an adverse effect on the company s business operations 
the company may incur unexpected expenditure in order to comply with us environmental laws 
the company s manufacturing sites are situated in the us and are subject to national  state and local environmental laws 
compliance with environmental laws requires ongoing expenditure and any spillage or contamination found to be caused by the company may result in clean up costs and financial penalties for the company which could adversely affect the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
contracts are used in all areas of operation of the business 
they may contain conditions that do not protect the company s position or with which it cannot comply 
contracts form the basis of agreement in many key activities such as mergers and acquisitions  arrangements with suppliers and outsourcing  or product licensing and marketing 
these contracts may contain conditions that impose duties on the parties involved or may fail to contain adequate conditions to protect the company s position 
the company may be unable to meet these conditions or may be unable to enforce other parties to comply and  therefore  may suffer financial loss or penalty 
the company has recently completed the acquisition of tkt 
if the company fails to integrate this acquisition successfully  it may impact on the company s future growth 
the company has recently completed the acquisition of tkt 
the benefits of this acquisition depend on the successful integration of tkt with the company 
if this integration is not successful  it may result in the products and or operations failing to deliver the anticipated benefits and could cause a diversion of management s time and resources

item legal proceedings general the company accounts for litigation losses and insurance claims and provisions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined in each accounting period in light of additional information becoming known 
in instances where the company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of loss  no litigation loss is recorded at that time 
as information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a reasonable estimate can be made 
the estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from the company s estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period 
phentermine shire us inc sus  a wholly owned subsidiary of shire  is a defendant in lawsuits still pending in both us federal and state courts which seek damages for  among other things  personal injury arising from phentermine products supplied for the treatment of obesity by sus and several other pharmaceutical companies 
sus  formerly known as shire richwood inc  has been sued as a manufacturer and distributor of phentermine  an anorectic used in the short term treatment of obesity and one of the products addressed by the lawsuits 
the suits relate to phentermine either alone or together with fenfluramine or dexenfluramine 
the lawsuits generally allege the following claims the defendants marketed phentermine and other products for the treatment of obesity and misled users about the products and dangers associated with them  the defendants failed adequately to test phentermine individually and when taken in combination with the other drugs  and the defendants knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs and should have informed the public about such risks and or failed to provide appropriate warning labels 
sus has been named as a defendant in a total of  such phentermine lawsuits  in respect of which sus has been dismissed as a defendant in  cases 
five of the remaining cases name shire as a defendant  but have not been served as required by state and federal rules of civil procedure 
it is expected that shire will be dismissed from the remaining cases based upon lack of product identification or agreement of the parties 
sus became involved with phentermine through its acquisition of certain assets of rexar pharmacal corporation rexar in january in addition to sus potentially incurring liability as a result of its own production of oby cap  a phentermine product  the plaintiffs may additionally seek to impose liability on sus as successor to rexar 
sus intends to defend vigorously all the lawsuits 
sus denies liability on a number of grounds including lack of scientific evidence that phentermine  properly prescribed  causes the alleged side effects and that sus did not promote phentermine for long term combined use as part of the fen phen diet 
accordingly  sus intends to defend vigorously any and all claims made against the company in respect of phentermine 
legal expenses to date have been paid by eon labs  inc eon  the supplier to sus  or eon s insurance carriers but such insurance is now exhausted 
eon has agreed to defend and indemnify sus in this litigation pursuant to an agreement dated november  between eon and sus

the lawsuit was dismissed in january dynepo in april  amgen inc amgen commenced a patent infringement action against tkt and sanofi aventis in the united states district court of massachusetts 
in january  the united states district court of massachusetts concluded that dynepo infringed eight of the claims of five patents that amgen had asserted 
amgen did not seek and was not awarded monetary damages 
this decision was subsequently appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in january  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the united states district court of massachusetts  remanded the action to the united states district court of massachusetts for further proceedings and instructed the united states district court of massachusetts to reconsider the validity of amgen s patents in the light of potentially invalidating prior art

appraisal rights in connection with shire s merger with tkt  former holders of approximately million shares of tkt common stock submitted written demands to the delaware court of chancery for appraisal of these shares and  as a result  elected not to accept the per share merger consideration 
on october   at the request of one of the holders to tender  shares at the merger price of per share  tkt filed a motion to dismiss the holder s demand 
on october   the delaware court of chancery granted this motion  and the holder tendered the shares at the merger consideration of per share 
therefore  as at december   former holders of approximately million shares of tkt common stock maintained written demands for appraisal of these shares and have elected not to accept the merger consideration 
in november  the delaware court of chancery approved a consolidation order filed by tkt whereby actions brought by all petitioners have been consolidated as one case 
to the extent that the remaining demands were validly asserted in accordance with the applicable requirements of delaware law and the former holders perfect their rights thereunder  such former holders will be entitled to receive the fair value of the shares as determined by the delaware court of chancery 
the determination of fair value will be made excluding any element of value arising from the transaction  such as cost savings or business synergies 
the delaware court of chancery may ascribe a valuation to the shares that is greater than  less than or equal to per share and may award interest on the amount determined in the appraisal process 
the total consideration for the acquisition of tkt  including amounts payable in respect of stock options and convertible securities  is approximately billion at the merger price of per share 
this could change if shire is required to pay a different amount of consideration in respect of the approximately million shares for which holders have asserted appraisal rights

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
overview shire s strategic goal is to become the leading specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
specifically  shire focuses its business on cns  gi  hgt and gp 
the structure is sufficiently flexible to allow shire to target new therapeutic areas to the extent opportunities arise through acquisitions 
shire believes that a carefully selected portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
shire s focused strategy is to develop and market products for specialist physicians 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in niche markets in the us or europe with strong intellectual property protection 
in accordance with this strategy  the company completed the acquisition of tkt on july  this acquisition added hgt to the company s existing business 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures  operating profits or losses and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments pharmaceutical products and royalties 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which is from adderall xr 
all product sales fall within the pharmaceutical products segment  of total revenues are derived from royalties 
all royalty income falls within the royalties segment 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
objectives are also set at the functional  market and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the group wide strategic objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management 
key performance indicators kpis are used to measure achievement of the objectives 
strategic objectives are categorised into fields financial  products markets  people capabilities and operational excellence 
for  shire s corporate objectives included defined levels of revenue and eps growth  forecasting accuracy to within defined margins  execution of defined therapeutic area and product plans  nda and emea filing targets for new products  maintenance of a stable and effective supply chain  effective leadership  team and individual development across functions  markets and therapeutic areas  effective recruitment and retention policy  implementation of global health and safety practices  implementation of defined it systems  maintenance of robust internal controls  and effective management of alliances and partnerships 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs as clinical studies are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection  and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty pharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets while the existing portfolio of approved products is heavily weighted towards the north american market  shire remains committed to diversifying the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market by continuing to expand its european operations 
shire s expansion in europe will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the north american and european markets wherever possible 
acquiring replagal which is presently sold only outside the us and dynepo to which the company has exclusive marketing rights outside the us as part of the acquisition of tkt  launching xagrid in the uk  germany  france and spain and launching fosrenol in ireland  sweden  denmark and austria during are examples of shire s execution of this strategy 
in addition  shire s late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with global rights  including elaprase  ga gcb both acquired as part of the tkt acquisition  mesavance and nrp the company intends to launch these products in both us and europe  thus furthering the company s european expansion 
the company will continue to pursue opportunities for its products in europe in and the first half of  including continuing the roll out of fosrenol  launching elaprase  launching dynepo  launching mesavance 
in the us in and the first half of  the company plans to launch daytrana  launch elaprase  launch mesavance  launch nrp  file spd and spd with the fda 
this program of new product launches will require significant investment at the outset causing sg a costs as a proportion of product sales to increase in the short term 
as a result of shire s strategic intent to focus on north america and europe  the company has sought out licensing partners to cover the japanese market for products in development 
in  the company successfully out licensed the japanese marketing and development rights for agrylin and fosrenol to two companies with an established presence in this market 
tkt is also party to an exclusive distribution agreement with sumitomo pharmaceutical co  ltd 
sumitomo  for the commercialization of replagal in japan  korea  taiwan  and china 
r d over the last two years shire has significantly refocused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas  which meet the needs of the specialist physician 
the company has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval of its later stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas 
evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the company s development pipeline over the last two years 
since january  five products have received regulatory approval in the us and two in europe and as at december   the company had five products in registration 
these actions are aimed at delivering the benefit of increased returns from the development of later stage product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
shire s acquisition of tkt was driven  in part  by the comparatively low risk profile of its product portfolio 
the hgt product portfolio is viewed by shire as relatively low risk as the diseases that the hgt products seek to treat are those caused by known human enzyme deficiencies 
using products with a known mechanism of action should reduce the risk of drug development 
r d costs in will be affected by shire s planned regulatory filings  phase b and phase studies to support new product launches  the commencement of phase trials on ga gcb  the transfer of two hgt projects into clinical development and the million milestone payment to new river paid upon acceptance of the nda by the fda 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and generally be able to sell the company s drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than shire s 
as adderall xr is  in revenue terms  shire s most significant product  representing of total revenues  the loss  expiration or circumvention of patent protection on this product in particular will be material to the company s revenues and earnings 
shire is engaged in legal proceedings with a generic manufacturer with respect to its adderall xr patents and the patents for certain other products 
these are discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings 
the potential impact of the introduction of generic products is illustrated by the approval of several generic versions of agrylin  which  as expected  adversely affected shire s sales of this product in in consequence of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and market exclusivity 
business development as part of its strategy of focusing on later stage and hence lower risk development projects  the company embarked on a disposal program of non core assets 
in  the company divested its us drug formulation business operated by shire laboratories  inc and out licensed spd  a pipeline product for the treatment of hiv 
in  the company sold its vaccines business and out licensed its oncology product troxatyl while in  the early stage research unit lead optimization was closed 
the company remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business model 
in january  the company in licensed nrp from new river and in july  completed the acquisition of tkt 
organization and structure during  the company completed its north american site consolidation  with the centralization of its us operations at the us headquarters in wayne  pennsylvania  and undertook a scheme of arrangement to establish shire as the holding company of the group  in place of spg 
as a result of the scheme  distributable reserves available to the holding company of the group increased to  million at december  million 
the distributable reserves will enable the group to pursue a long term dividend policy 
recent developments adderall xr patent litigation third notice letter from teva on january   shire received a third notice letter from teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc advising it of an amendment to teva s existing anda for generic versions of adderall xr 
the amendment is directed to an additional strength of mg 
as previously announced  teva s february notice letter was directed only to mg and mg dosages and teva s june notice letter was directed only to mg  mg and mg dosages 
shire is currently reviewing the details of teva s latest notice letter 
settlement of impax litigations on january   shire settled its adderall xr patent infringement lawsuits with impax 
the litigations involved shire us patents  nos 
 the patent   the patent and  the patent 
as part of the settlement  impax has confirmed that its proposed generic adderall xr product infringes shire s  and patents and that the three patents are valid and enforceable 
under the terms of the settlement  impax will be permitted to market generic versions of adderall xr in the us no later than january   and will pay shire a royalty from those sales 
in certain situations  such as the launch of another generic version of adderall xr  impax may be permitted to enter the market as shire s authorized generic 
no payments to impax are involved in the settlement agreement 
nrp on january   the fda accepted new river s nda for nrp for review 
this has triggered a million milestone payment by the company to new river 
mesavance spd the company has submitted applications for marketing approval to a number of european regulatory agencies and also filed a new drug submission for spd with health canada 
idb loan repayment on february   the company received notice from idb that it intended to repay in full all of its loan drawings for injectable flu development of million  together with accrued and capitalized interest of million see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
the company received the million outstanding on february  the amounts outstanding in respect of idb drawings for pipeline development principal drawings million  are unaffected by this repayment 
research and development shire focuses its development resources on late stage development projects within its core therapeutic areas of cns  gi  hgt and gp 
products in pre launch at december  fosrenol in november  the company received fda approval for mg and mg dosage strengths 
dynepo was approved in the eu in march and is indicated for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure 
shire expects to commence a staged launch in europe of the product in the first half of products in registration at december  elaprase on november   the company submitted a bla with the fda for idursulfase 
in january the filing was accepted for priority review by the fda 
the expected prescription drug user fee act date is may elaprase on december   the company submitted a maa to the emea for idursulfase for the treatment of hunter syndrome

the following discussion includes references to prescription and market share data for key products 
the source of this data is ims health  december during  the company concluded new fee for service agreements with two of its three significant wholesale customers 
these agreements  which are commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry  change the way wholesalers are compensated 
under the agreements  the wholesalers receive a distribution fee from pharmaceutical suppliers 
these fee for service agreements eliminate wholesalers incentives to acquire and hold excess inventories 
the company believes this will reduce the significant impact of wholesaler stocking and de stocking on its product sales 
further  the wholesalers will provide data regarding their inventories of the company s products it has on hand 
the company is negotiating a fee for service agreement with its remaining significant wholesale customer 
fees for service are treated as a sales deduction  thus affecting revenues rather than cost of sales 
adderall xr us prescriptions for adderall xr for the year to december   were up 
adderall xr  further strengthened its position as the leading brand in the us adhd market with a increase in market share to an all time high of in december december 
in addition  the us adhd market grew overall compared to the same period in product sales growth was higher than prescription growth for the year due mainly to the impact of price increases in december and august  partially offset by a decrease in pipeline inventory and higher sales deductions 
fda approval of the adolescent indication for adderall xr was received on july  on february   shire announced that it had suspended sales of adderall xr in canada at the request of health canada 
on august   shire announced that health canada would reinstate the marketing authorization of adderall xr in canada effective august  this reinstatement follows the acceptance by health canada of the recommendations from the new drug committee  which was appointed by health canada at shire s request to review the suspension of adderall xr in canada 
during october  shire filed a citizen petition with the fda requesting that the fda require more rigorous bioequivalence testing or additional clinical testing for generic or follow on drug products that reference adderall xr before they can be approved 
shire believes that these requested criteria will ensure that generic formulations of adderall xr or follow on drug products will be clinically effective and safe 
in january  shire chose to file a supplemental amendment to its original citizen petition  which included additional clinical data in support of the original filing 
the fda has six months to respond to shire s petition and while this petition is under review it will not grant final approval of generic or follow on drug products referencing adderall xr 
on february   an fda advisory committee recommended to the fda that risk information about cardiovascular events be included in a black box warning for all stimulant medicines used to treat adhd 
in making its recommendation  the advisory committee recognized that the reported incidence rates of the rare serious cardiovascular adverse events that were discussed by the committee are generally within the rates that would be expected from the untreated general population 
adderall xr and adderall already include a black box warning in their labels for safety concerns related to amphetamine abuse or misuse and also warn of the risk of sudden death in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities 
shire stands behind the current labeling and believes that further action is unwarranted 
it is too early to tell at the time of filing of this annual report on form k what impact the actions of the fda will have on consumer sentiment in the us adhd market or on adderall xr s us market share 
in january  shire settled its adderall xr patent infringement lawsuits with impax 
the litigations involved shire us patents  nos 
 the patent   the patent and  the patent 
as part of the settlement  impax has confirmed that its proposed generic adderall xr product infringes shire s  and patents and that the three patents are valid and enforceable 
under the terms of the settlement  impax will be permitted to market generic versions of adderall xr in the us no later than january   and will pay shire a royalty from those sales 
in certain situations  such as the launch of another generic version of adderall xr  impax may be permitted to enter the market as shire s authorized generic 
shire s adderall xr patent infringement lawsuits with barr continue 
shire is seeking a ruling that barr s abbreviated new drug application anda seeking permission to market its generic versions of adderall xr infringes the  and patents 
barr s month stay under the hatch waxman act expired on february  following the expiry of the month stay  the fda may approve barr s anda 
a final pre trial conference in the and patent cases is set for march  no trial date has been set 
shire is continuing its discussions with barr in connection with these lawsuits and the discussions are progressing 
for further information see item legal proceedings 
if the company does not prevail in the lawsuits  the company s sales of adderall xr will decrease 
any decrease in the sales of adderall xr would significantly reduce revenues and earnings 
carbatrol us prescriptions for the year to december   were down compared to the previous year 
this was due primarily to supply constraints  a decrease in shire s market share of the total us extended release carbamazepine prescription market to in december december and a decrease in that market as a whole 
the supply constraints have now been resolved 
product sales for the year to december   were up compared to the previous year 
the difference between sales growth and the lower level of prescriptions is due to price increases in august and october and to lower sales deductions than in patent litigation proceedings with nostrum relating to carbatrol are in progress 
for further information see item legal proceedings 
pentasa us prescriptions for the year to december  were up compared to the previous year 
the increase was due to the success of the co promotional agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals inc  the impact of the mg dosage form launched in the third quarter of and a increase in the total us oral mesalamine prescription market 
product sales for the year to december  were up  compared to the previous year 
the difference between sales growth and prescription growth is due to the impact of the september price increase and a normalization of pipeline inventories compared to lower levels in pentasa had an share of the total us oral mesalamine prescription market in december december 
agrylin xagrid agrylin xagrid sales worldwide for the year to december  were million  down compared to the previous year million 
north american sales were million  down compared to the previous year million 
this reduction was expected following the approval of generic versions of agrylin in the us market in april rest of the world sales all sales outside north america were million  up  compared to the previous year million 
this was primarily due to the successful launch of xagrid in the uk  germany and france in the first quarter of and spain in the third quarter of in accordance with current orphan drug legislation in the eu  xagrid will have up to years of marketing exclusivity in the eu 
fosrenol fosrenol was launched in the us in january product sales for the year to december  were million  with us prescriptions for the year totaling  fosrenol had an share of the total us phosphate binding market in december on november  the fda approved new  higher dose formulations of fosrenol 
new  higher dose strengths of milligrams and milligrams were shipped to wholesalers in the us in december higher dose strengths should help to reduce the number of pills that end stage renal disease patients need to take to achieve target phosphorus levels 
product sales in q were million compared with million in q the variance relates primarily to increased pipeline inventory sales to wholesalers of the new higher dose formulation during december 
fosrenol was launched in austria in december shire continues its discussions relating to fosrenol with regulatory authorities and reimbursement agencies across europe and other regions and further launches are expected in european markets over the next few months  subject to obtaining national approvals and concluding pricing and reimbursement negotiations 
replagal replagal was acquired by shire as part of the tkt acquisition  which completed on july  product sales for the period since acquisition were million 
the majority of replagal sales are in europe 
total sales for the full year  including pre acquisition sales  were million million 
the increase in sales including pre acquisition sales is primarily due to greater european coverage by an increased number of sales representatives

the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions 
shire operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
for the year to december   there were three customers in the us who accounted for of the company s total revenues 
financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments and trade accounts receivable 
excess cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including bank and building society term deposits  commercial paper and other debt securities from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings 
these investments typically bear minimal risk 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for sales deductions  valuation of intangible assets and fixed asset investments  contingent liabilities  the valuation of tax assets and liabilities  the valuation of in process research and development and inventory acquired with tkt and the amount payable to former holders of tkt common stock of approximately million shares who have submitted written demands for appraisal of these shares in relation to the company s acquisition of tkt on july  i litigation the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to product liability claims 
shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period 
there were no significant changes in estimates in respect of product liability claim provisions in ii valuation of intangible assets a general the company has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets  recorded at acquisition cost 
as at december   the carrying value of such intangibles was million  which primarily related to the company s agrylin  xagrid  carbatrol  colazide  daytrana  dynepo  fosrenol  pentasa  reminyl  replagal  solaraze and vaniqa products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition as acquired in process r d  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
a prolonged general economic downturn  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s valuation of the estimated future net cash flows generated by its long lived assets 
as a result  future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of long lived assets 
in the year to december   changes to the estimated future net cash flows from certain products resulted in a million impairment of intangible assets million  million 
in the year to december   the company has decreased the useful economic life of a product  which resulted in an addition amortization charge in of million 
the company reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flows approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
b intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt the fair value of all of the identifiable intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt has been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis  by independent valuation specialists 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  the customer relationships and the other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  royalty or licence fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products  cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  and the estimated life of the products 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows

iii in process r d write off in process r d is defined by fin as being a development project that has been initiated and achieved material progress but has not yet resulted in a commercially viable product 
as required by fin  the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process r d of million  acquired as part of the tkt transaction  was immediately expensed 
in the identification of intangible assets  consideration is given to whether any technology that is identified is developed or in process 
the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries gives guidance on the factors that should be considered when identifying in process r d 
the fair value of in process r d acquired with tkt was determined using the income approach on a project by project basis 
this method is based on the present value of earnings attributable to the asset or costs avoided as a result of owning the assets 
this method includes risk factors  which include applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the project s stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific in process r d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data  general and administrative expenses  and r d expenses 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows 
iv valuation of equity investments the company has investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period  adverse news on a private company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compounds  ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition of the investee 
in instances when the review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  the company writes down the investment to the fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized loss on a publicly quoted investment is permanent requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire recorded impairments on fixed asset investments of million million  million 
v sales deductions sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  trade discounts  wholesaler chargebacks and allowances for the coupon sampling program 
statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with hmos are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price 
rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product as prices increase 
provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends 
revisions or clarification from centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
however  at the time of sale  the prices of the company s products are fixed and consequently the rebates can be reasonably determinable at the outset of each transaction it undertakes with its customers  and therefore these factors would not impact the recording of revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
provisions for product returns and sales deductions to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates based upon past activity levels  the duration of time in the processing of deductions  and other factors such as the launch of a new drug  the loss of patent protection or new competition 
where such factors are relevant  shire develops provisions for returns based on wholesaler customer channel checks for slow moving product and a separate management review of estimated customer inventory levels  by product 
to the extent that shire is unable to estimate returns  recognition of revenue is deferred until either the product is sold to the pharmacy or until shire receives payment from the wholesaler 
shire accepts customer returns in the following circumstances a expiration of product  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c specific sales terms  at product launch  that allow for unconditional return of product guaranteed sales 
customer return periods range from one to twenty four months with an average return period of six months 
in addition  shire monitors customer inventory levels  based on estimated prescription demand  and limits the amount of product shipped to a customer when there appears to be a protracted pattern of customer ordering that exceeds shire s estimate of underlying demand 
the practice of monitoring inventory levels allows shire to more accurately predict customer returns 
the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire revises its estimates every period and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
there have been no material adjustments to the estimates recognized related to shire s provisions for sales rebates or returns  in any of the periods presented 
vi income taxes shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments and because shire operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
the company has significant deferred assets due to net operating losses nols in the united states  uk and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based upon estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nols a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results 
the acquisition of tkt brings to shire significant nols  and other tax reliefs  creating additional gross deferred tax assets of million 
a valuation allowance of million has been established against these deferred tax assets  principally in respect of certain us state tax losses  because it is currently considered unlikely that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the relevant us states to utilize these tax losses 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
vii inventory inventory acquired through the acquisition of tkt has been fair valued in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations as follows finished goods and merchandise at estimated selling prices less the sum of a costs of disposal and b a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquiring entity  work in process at estimated selling prices of finished goods less the sum of a costs to complete  b costs of disposal  and c a reasonable profit allowance for the completing and selling effort of the acquiring entity based on profit for similar finished goods 
the fair value of inventory is based on information at the date of acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with inventory will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual costs and proceeds associated with acquired inventory may vary from those forecasted 
recent accounting pronouncements update see note y to the consolidated financial statements contained in the part iv of this annual report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and effects on financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

as a matter of policy  the company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure 
the board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks in the following areas interest rate risk as at december   the company has no material debt outstanding 
therefore  the company s interest charge on its debt obligations is low and consequently the company s interest expense charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements 
the company is exposed to movements in interest rates affecting interest income 
this exposure is primarily to us dollar interest rates 
as the company maintains all of its investments on a short term basis for liquidity purposes this risk is not actively managed

the consolidated financial statements of foreign entities are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
the exposure to foreign exchange risk is managed and monitored by the treasury function 
exposures are generally managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of cash balances 
as at december   the company had five outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a total principal amount of million equivalent to manage the currency risk associated with certain inter company loans 
as at december   there were net unrealized gains of million on these contracts 
market risk of investments as at december   the company has million of investments comprising equity investment funds  private companies and publicly quoted equities 
the public quoted companies are exposed to market risk 
no financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk
