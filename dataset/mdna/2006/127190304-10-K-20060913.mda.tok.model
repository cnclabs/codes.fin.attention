this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read risk factors  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise specifically noted  all years refer to the company s fiscal year which ends on june overview we are a leading provider of information based systems  integrated solutions and services to the us government 
we derived approximately of our revenues during the year ended june  from contracts with us government agencies  including approximately percent from dod customers  and approximately percent from us federal civilian agencies customers including the department of homeland security 
we also provide services to state and local governments and commercial customers 
for the year ended june   approximately of our us government revenue was from contracts where we were the lead  or prime  contractor 
our diverse contract base has approximately active contracts and more than  active task orders 
for the year ended june   no single task order or contract accounted for more than percent of our revenue 
we have a diverse mix of contract types  with approximately   and of our revenues for the year ended june   derived from time and materials  cost plus and fixed price contracts  respectively 
we generally do not pursue fixed price software development contracts that may create financial risk 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the following are considered our critical accounting policies revenue recognition contract accounting the company generates essentially all of its revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
the company considers fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for cost plus fee contracts that include performance based fee incentives  and that are subject to the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as the company s prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance 
for such cost plus fee contracts subject to the provisions of us securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  the company recognizes the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus allowable expenses incurred 
the company has four basic categories of fixed price contracts  fixed unit price  fixed price level of effort  fixed price completion  and fixed price license 
revenue on fixed unit price contracts  where specified units of output under service arrangements are delivered  is recognized as units are delivered based on the specified price per unit 
revenue on fixed unit price maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the service period 
revenue for fixed price level of effort contracts is recognized based upon the number of units of labor actually delivered multiplied by the agreed rate for each unit of labor 
a significant portion of the company s fixed price completion contracts involve the design and development of complex client systems 
for these contracts that are within the scope of sop  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of sop  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
the company s fixed price license agreements and related services contracts are primarily executed in its international operations 
as the agreements to deliver software require significant production  modification or customization of software  revenue is recognized using the contract accounting guidance of sop for agreements to deliver data under license and related services  revenue is recognized as the data is delivered and services are performed 
except for losses on time and material contracts accounted for under sab  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
projected losses on time and material contracts accounted for under sab are recognized as the services and materials are provided 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting costs  and other direct costs  as well as an allocation of allowable indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees for certain contracts may also be a factor in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
products and services provided under long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
for our federal contracts  we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
due to the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business operations personnel conduct thorough periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
costs of revenue costs of revenue include all direct contract costs as well as indirect overhead costs and selling  general and administrative expenses that are allowable and allocable to contracts under federal procurement standards 
costs of revenue also include costs and expenses that are unallowable under applicable procurement standards  and thus are not allocable to contracts for billing purposes 
such costs and expenses do not directly generate revenues  but are necessary for business operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts management establishes bad debt reserves against certain billed receivables based upon the latest information available to determine whether invoices are ultimately collectible 
whenever judgment is involved in determining the estimates  there is the potential for bad debt expense and the fair value of accounts receivable to be misstated 
given that we primarily serve the us government and that  in our opinion  we have sufficient controls in place to properly recognize revenue  we believe the risk to be relatively low that a misstatement of accounts receivable would have a material impact on our financial results 
accounts receivable balances are written off when the balance is deemed uncollectible after exhausting all reasonable means of collection 
goodwill valuation acquisitions of businesses have constituted a major portion of the company s historical growth  and as a result goodwill has increased over the years to represent a significant portion of both our long term and total assets 
we account for our goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas  which requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the fas goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
fas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment at the same date every year  and also when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the company has selected june as its annual testing date 
we estimate the fair values of the company s operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our estimates of future revenues and operating costs related to contract backlog and fundings  historical operating margins  recompete win rates  the length of customer relationships  and assessments of the market conditions surrounding the government information technology services industry 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by our senior management 
changes in these forecasts could cause the company to either pass or fail the first step in the fas goodwill valuation model  which could result in impairment 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the requirement to recognize an impairment  and the amount of such impairment  if any 
as of june   a percent increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation effective july   the company adopted fas r using the modified retrospective application transition method 
prior to july   the company had accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method  under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
the company also followed the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas and reported the pro forma impact of stock option expense in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements 
under the modified retrospective application method  the company has restated its consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended june   and its consolidated balance sheets as of june  and restatements of selected footnote disclosures to the consolidated financial statements included with the company s annual report on form k a as filed with the us securities and exchange commission on september   have also been made 
these restated consolidated financial statements and notes were filed under a form k with the securities and exchange commission on june  the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for each year in the two year period ended june   and affected footnotes therewith  reflect the impact of the retrospective application of fas r 
in applying the new accounting standard retrospectively  the company has calculated the cumulative impact of stock based compensation expense as though it had adopted the provisions of fas effective july  the impact of stock based compensation expense on net earnings  comprehensive income  deferred income taxes  additional paid in capital  and cash flows for all equity grants made since this date have been calculated 
the impacts on the statements of operations  cash flows and comprehensive income for the years ended june  and  are as follows amounts reported for the year ended june  as previously reported effect of retrospective application of fas r as restated consolidated statement of operations indirect costs and selling expenses income from operations income before income taxes income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted consolidated statement of cash flows cash flows provided by operations cash flows used in financing activities consolidated statement of comprehensive income comprehensive income amounts reported for the year ended june  as previously reported effect of retrospective application of fas r as restated consolidated statement of operations indirect costs and selling expenses income from operations income before income taxes income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted consolidated statement of cash flows cash flows provided by operations cash flows used in financing activities consolidated statement of comprehensive income comprehensive income the company also restated its consolidated balance sheet as of june  the cumulative effects on deferred tax assets  additional paid in capital  and retained earnings as of these dates are as follows as previously reported effect of retrospective application of fas r as restated balances as of june  deferred tax assets  long term deferred tax liabilities  long term additional paid in capital retained earnings the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model and the following assumptions for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended june  historical volatility expected dividends expected term in years risk free rate the expected term of the option grants represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the contractual term of the grant  vesting schedules  and past exercise behavior 
the risk free rates for periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the respective grant 
in conjunction with its adoption of fas r  the company began recognizing the expense associated with restricted stock units rsus and non qualified stock options granted to employees that have reached  or are close to reaching  age  in accordance with issue no 
of the fasb s emerging issue task force eitf bulletin no 
 issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 eitf  issue 
eitf became effective in september  and issue requires that the value of equity instruments awarded to employees that are eligible for retirement  and that contain terms which provide for immediate vesting upon retirement  be recognized in full upon grant 
issue of eitf also requires that the value of such equity instruments granted to employees nearing retirement age be recognized ratably over the period from the date of grant  to the date the grantee is eligible for retirement 
immediate recognition of expense the non substantive vesting method is required under issue of eitf even when the grantee has  or plans to  remain an employee of the company beyond the eligible retirement age 
the company did not  however  apply the non substantive vesting method in recognizing stock based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  had the company applied the provisions of issue of eitf to its stock compensation expense  its net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended june   would have been affected as follows amounts as restated for the retroactive application of fas r effect of retirement vesting provisions on stock based compensation expense amounts adjusted to reflect retirement vesting provisions year ended june  net income weighted average earnings per share basic diluted issue would have had no effect on the results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  as the provision granting full vesting to those retiring at or after age has been included in grants made only since july  for all rsu and stock option grants made on or after july   the company is applying the non substantive vesting method for stock based compensation expense recognition purposes 
information regarding the stock options and restricted stock unit activity during each of the years in the three year period ended june   and information about assumptions underlying the valuation of equity instruments  and methods of expense recognition  are discussed in note  stock plans and stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statements of operations years ended june    and year ended june year to year change to to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars percent dollar amounts in thousands revenue costs of revenue direct costs indirect costs and selling expenses depreciation and amortization total costs of revenue income from operations interest expense  net net income before income taxes income taxes net income revenue for the fiscal year ended june   the company s total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately percent  or million  of revenue growth was organic and resulted from an increase in services provided to a broad base of department of defense dod  intelligence  and federal civilian agency customers 
the remaining percent increase  or million  was from acquisitions completed in fy during fy  total revenue increased by million  or percent 
approximately million of this growth was organic and resulted primarily from increases in services and solutions provided to our dod customers 
the remaining million of the fy revenue growth was generated by four businesses that were acquired in fy revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue growth 
the company s acquisition revenue for fy and fy  is as follows business acquired iss nsr alphainsight d ig cms c cubed others total the following table summarizes revenues earned by each of the customer groups for the three most recent fiscal years year ended june  dollar amounts in thousands department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial state local government total revenue from dod customers increased percent  or million  to approximately  million for fy as compared to fy the aforementioned acquisitions accounted for approximately percent of this growth  contributing million 
dod revenue includes that earned for services provided to the us army  its largest customer  where company services focus on supporting readiness  tactical military intelligence  and communications of the warfighter in iraq and afghanistan 
dod revenue also includes work with the us navy  such as services to support the navy s automatic identification technologies and a mine countermeasure program that protects its fleet 
dod revenue growth in fy compared to fy was million  or percent 
this growth was driven by the above referenced acquisitions and included million attributed to the may   acquisition of the d ig 
this growth is also attributed to increased demands from the company s us army customers  particularly in support of tactical military intelligence  communications and logistical services provided to the army missions in iraq and afghanistan 
work with the us navy remained strong during fy  with increased levels of work coming from the growing presence in supporting naval aviation 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased million  or percent  to million during fy as compared to fy the primary revenue growth drivers in this area came from acquisitions  which accounted for almost percent of the increase 
approximately percent of federal civilian agency revenue for the year was derived from the department of justice doj  for whom the company provides litigation support services and maintains a debt collection system 
revenue from the doj was million in fy versus million in fy the decrease in revenue earned from the doj resulted from the conclusion  early in fy  of services provided to support doj litigation efforts involving the tobacco industry 
during fy as compared to fy  federal civilian agency revenue increased million  or percent 
acquisitions accounted for all of the growth during fy  with the majority of growth contributed by systems and analysis services provided by the d ig to various intelligence agencies 
commercial revenue increased percent  or million  to million in fy as compared to fy commercial revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations 
in fy  international operations accounted for percent  or million  of the total commercial revenue  while the domestic operations accounted for percent  or million 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily from our uk operations  which increased by percent  or million 
growth in the uk was generated by two acquisitions completed in fy  and from increased sales by its marketing systems group that supplies demographic software and data services 
this increase was partly offset by a downturn in domestic commercial revenue primarily from a decrease in the level of software sales and services 
during fy commercial revenue increased percent  or million  as compared to fy the increase was primarily attributable to international operations within the uk  which showed growth from its marketing systems group that supplies demographic software and data services 
growth in the uk during fy was also attributed to increased sales of its software services business to customers in the retail and telecommunications industries 
revenue from state and local governments decreased by percent  or million during fy  as compared to fy the main driver of the decrease was the downturn of contract work with two state contracts during the fourth quarter of fy in fy as compared to fy  revenue from state and local governments increased by percent  or million 
approximately one third of this increase  or million  was related directly to the march acquisition of cms 
the balance of the growth resulted from increased demand for information technology services provided across a number of states 
revenue from state and local governments represented percent and percent of the company s total revenue in fy and fy  respectively 
the company s continued and expanded focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities has resulted in a reduced emphasis on state and local government business 
income from operations 
operating income increased percent  or million  in fy as compared to fy the company s operating margin in fy was percent compared to percent a year earlier 
the decrease in margin rate relates primarily to a higher mix of other direct costs odcs including equipment purchases and subcontractor services  relative to direct professional service costs 
these odcs produce lower gross margins as compared to services provided directly by company employees 
in fy as compared to fy  operating income increased percent  or million 
operating margin in fy improved to percent from percent a year earlier 
this improvement was driven by the higher margins provided by the d ig acquisition  economies of scale related with acquisitions  and the growth in high margin national security and intelligence services 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  as a percentage of revenue  total direct costs were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the year to year increases in direct costs as a percentage of revenue have been driven by an increase in cost plus contract content as a percent of revenue earned from all contract types  and an increase in the use of subcontractors 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs such as equipment purchases  subcontract costs and travel expenses 
other direct costs  which are common in our industry  typically are incurred in response to specific client tasks and may vary from period to period 
the largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor during the last three fiscal years is attributable to the internal growth in the company s federal government business both in the dod and federal civilian agencies  and to acquisitions 
other direct costs were million  million  and million in fy  fy  and fy  respectively 
the year over year increase was primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across system integration  knowledge management and engineering services including the aforementioned acquisitions 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
many of these expenses are highly variable and have grown in dollar volume generally in proportion to the growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  indirect costs and selling expenses were percent  percent and percent for fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the decrease in percentage experienced during the two most recent fiscal years is primarily the result of the company s success in integrating acquired businesses while controlling its various indirect and general and administrative expenses in these periods of growth 
another component of indirect costs and selling expenses is stock compensation 
under its stock incentive plan  the company grants non qualified stock options  shares of restricted stock  and restricted stock units to senior executives and officers as a form of long term incentive compensation 
total stock compensation expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
the million increase in expense from fy to fy was due primarily to the accelerated expense recognition for certain grants in which employees become fully vested in the award upon retirement at or after age the increased expense is also attributed to a greater value of options and rsus granted in fy versus fy the increase of million from fy to fy was primarily the result of a greater level of rsu grants issued 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in fy as compared to fy the increase was attributable to the amortization of the identifiable intangible assets acquired with the five business combinations completed during fy in fy as compared to fy  depreciation and amortization expense increased million or percent 
this was attributable to an million increase in intangible asset amortization  primarily that pertaining to the may acquisition of the d ig 
the remaining increase of approximately million was for new capital expenditures and building improvements made in support of on going business operations 
interest expense increased million  or percent in fy  as compared to fy the primary driver for the increase was due to an approximate percent increase in the weighted average interest rate  excluding the effects of two interest rate swap agreements  as it applies to the company s average borrowings 
higher interest expense also resulted from borrowings of million to supplement available cash necessary to complete the acquisition of iss 
the higher interest expense was partially offset by interest income generated from cash on hand 
the company had outstanding borrowings of million at june  the company is required to repay a minimum of million annually under the terms of its credit facility 
interest expense increased million in fy as compared to fy the majority of this increase was due to a full year of interest costs relating to the company s borrowings in may of million under its credit facility which was used to finance the purchase of the d ig 
for fy  the company incurred approximately two months of interest under the credit facility described above 
prior to may  the company was able to fund its operations from proceeds received from its march secondary offering  available cash and equivalents and operating cash flows 
the effective income tax rates in fy  fy and fy  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the lower tax rate in fy as compared to the prior two fiscal years reflects the benefits realized from increasing research and development credits and lower state taxes 
the research and development credits were generated primarily from activities of the d ig business 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in note  quarterly financial data  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
effects of inflation based on the company s contract mix reported for fy  approximately percent of the company s business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs that are affected by inflation 
approximately percent of revenue is earned under time and material contracts  where labor rates for many of the services provided under time and material contracts  are often fixed for several years 
under certain time and material contracts containing indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity procurement arrangements  the company does adjust labor rates annually as permitted 
the remaining portion of the company s business is fixed price and may span multiple years 
the company generally has been able to price its time and materials and fixed price contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations  and its available credit facilities  have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fund the company s operational needs 
cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
between march and may  the principal source of liquidity and capital to fund business acquisitions were the proceeds from the company s march offering of million shares of common stock 
the company raised million from this offering  and during the period between march and may  invested approximately million in the acquisition of eight businesses 
operating cash flows and borrowings under credit facilities were used to supplement the offering proceeds  as necessary  to fund the acquisition of these eight businesses 
to fund the acquisition of the d ig  the company entered into a million credit facility the credit facility  which includes a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility  and a million institutional term loan the term loan 
the initial borrowings under the credit facility were million  of which million was outstanding under the term loan at june  during the fiscal year ended june   the company received million in advances from borrowings under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility is a five year  secured facility that permits continuously renewable borrowings of up to million  with annual sublimits on amounts borrowed for acquisitions 
the revolving facility also contains an accordion feature under which the company may borrow up to an additional million with prior lender approvals 
the revolving facility permits one  two  three and six month interest rate options and repayment of any outstanding balances is due in full may  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the facility 
the term loan portion of the credit facility is a seven year secured facility under which principal payments are due in quarterly installments of million at the end of each fiscal quarter through march  and the balance of million is due in full on may  interest rates for both the revolving credit and term loan borrowings are based on libor  or the higher of the prime rate  or federal funds rate  plus applicable margins 
margin and unused fee rates are determined quarterly based on the company s leverage ratios 
the company is expected to operate within certain limits on leverage  net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios throughout the term of the credit facility 
the total costs associated with securing the credit facility were approximately million  and are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
in may  the company amended the credit facility by reducing the margins applicable to the libor and prime and federal funds rate factors  and in june entered an interest rate swap agreement covering a portion of the outstanding term loan balance 
the company incurred approximately million of fees to amend the credit facility  which has been capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the company also has amounts due under lease agreements classified as capital leases for reporting purposes  amounts due under a mortgage note payable  and maintains a line of credit facility in the united kingdom 
the total amount of reported principal due under the capital lease agreements and the mortgage note payable was million at june  the total amount available under the line of credit facility in the uk  which is scheduled to expire in december  is approximately million 
as of june   the company had no borrowings under this facility 
cash and equivalents were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the company s operating cash flow was million for fy  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the current year decrease in operating cash flow results in part to delays in contract fundings by the us government 
including the company s recent acquisitions  days sales outstanding were at june   compared to for the same period a year ago 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions  days sales outstanding were as of june  the company used million  and million  of cash in investing activities during fy and fy  respectively 
the significant increase in fy was attributed to million used to complete five acquisitions during the year 
during fy  the company paid million to acquire a company within its uk operations and also made a million earn out payment relating to an acquisition within its us operations 
there were no other acquisition related payments made during fy purchases of office and computer related equipment of million and million in fy and fy  respectively  accounted for the majority of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
we have relatively low capital expenditure requirements for our business  and expect these expenditures in the coming years to remain consistent with the levels reported in recent fiscal years 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during fy  while net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fy cash provided by financing activities during fy consisted primarily of a million borrowing under the revolving facility that was made to help finance the acquisition of iss on march  financing activity cash was also provided by proceeds received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefits  as described below 
cash used in financing activities during fy resulted primarily from the repayment of borrowings under the revolving facility 
these borrowings had been made to help finance the acquisition of the d ig in may  and the company applied cash generated during fy to repay due under various debt arrangements  including million repaid under the revolving facility 
during fy  the financing cash proceeds were also generated by stock option exercises and the related tax benefits  which partially offset the net financing cash used to repay outstanding borrowings 
cash flows from financing activities continued to benefit from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  and purchases of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from these activities totaled million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
these were offset by cash used to purchase stock to fulfill obligations under the employee stock purchase plan 
cash used to acquire stock was million and million during fy and fy  respectively 
on february   the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to sell up to million of common stock  preferred stock  or debt securities from time to time in one or more public offerings 
the registration statement was amended and became effective in may the net proceeds from any sale of the securities would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes including repayment of debt  share repurchases  and capital expenditures 
the company believes that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings  cash and cash equivalents on hand  will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on going operations  customary capital expenditures  debt service obligations  and other working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
over the longer term  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations necessary to fulfill the obligations under our credit facility will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by many factors outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we use off balance sheet arrangements primarily to finance the lease of operating facilities 
with the exception of a building acquired in connection with an acquisition completed during the year ended june   we currently finance the use of all of our office and warehouse facilities through operating leases 
operating leases are also used to finance the use of computers  servers  phone systems  and to a lesser extent  other fixed assets  such as furnishings  that are obtained in connection with business acquisitions 
we generally assume the lease rights and obligations of companies acquired in business combinations and continue financing equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date 
we generally do not finance capital expenditures with operating leases  but instead finance such purchases with available cash balances 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations  including lease obligations  as of june   that require the company to make future cash payments payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term liabilities reflected on the registrants balance sheet under gaap other notes payable deferred compensation total see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the interest rates on both the institutional term loan and the revolving credit facility portion of the company s credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company seeks to manage these fluctuations in part  through interest rate swaps 
a one percent change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in the company s interest expense fluctuating by approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the company seeks to manage these fluctuations  in part  through interest rate swaps 
as of june   the company was party to two interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of million 
these two swap agreements provide fixed rate payments in lieu of floating rate payments for two years beginning march the company is not currently considering any further interest rate swap agreements  but may reconsider as market conditions fluctuate in the future 
approximately percent and percent of the company s total revenues in fy and fy  respectively  were derived from customers of our international operations  primarily in the uk the company s practice in its international operations is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
as of june  the company had approximately million in cash held in pounds sterling in the uk this allows the company to better utilize its cash resources on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
