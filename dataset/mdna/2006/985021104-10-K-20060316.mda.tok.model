limitations on payment of dividends under applicable new jersey law  the company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if  following the payment of the dividend  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities 
further  it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if future retained earnings would be consistent with the company s capital  asset quality and financial condition 
since it has no significant independent sources of income  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to receive dividends from the bank 
under national banking laws  the bank must obtain the approval of the occ before declaring any dividend which  together with all other dividends declared by the bank in the same calendar year  will exceed the total of the bank s net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
net profits are to be calculated without adding back any provision for the bank s allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  the bank  as an fdic insured institution  may not pay dividends or make distributions that would cause the institution to fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
these restrictions would not prevent the bank from paying dividends from current earnings to the company at this time 
in addition  as a bank whose deposits are insured by the fdic  the bank may not pay dividends or distribute any of its capital assets while it remains in default of any assessment due to the fdic 
the bank is not in default under any of its obligations to the fdic 

table of contents under the agreement with the occ  and the supervisory letter from the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  prior regulatory approval is required for dividend payments by both the bank and the company 
effect of government monetary policies the earnings of the company are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the frb has had  and will likely continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the frb has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
usa patriot act the usa patriot act authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the other federal financial institution regulatory agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions

in addition  the usa patriot act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to request for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
the usa patriot act also requires the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions 
the department of treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements of the usa patriot act 
these regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program

statistical disclosure the company s statistical disclosure information  required of bank holding companies  is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is set forth in item of this report 
item a 
risk factors 
the following is a discussion of certain significant risk factors that could potentially negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to grow our business  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
during the last five years  our total assets have grown substantially from billion at december  to billion at december  our business strategy calls for continued expansion  but we do not anticipate growth to continue at this rate 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch locations  successfully attract deposits to existing and new branches  and identify favorable loan and acquisition opportunities 
in the event that we do not continue to grow  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to manage our growth  which may adversely impact our financial results 
as part of our expansion strategy  we plan to open new branches in our existing and target markets 
however  we may be unable to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us or to hire qualified management to operate the new branches 
in addition  the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipated or we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to open new branches 
new branches may take longer than expected to reach profitability  and we cannot assure that they will become profitable 
the additional costs of starting new branches may adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 

table of contents the company may require additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
the company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations 
the company may at some point need to raise additional capital to comply with regulatory requirements  including requirements under the bank s agreement with the occ  or to support continued growth 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the company s control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  the ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired 
our exposure to credit risk  because we focus on commercial lending  could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
there are certain risks inherent in making loans 
these risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in the economy  risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and  in the case of a loan backed by collateral  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
commercial loans are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn 
commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans  which comprise our commercial loan portfolio  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction and development loans  which are included as part of our commercial real estate loans  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial mortgage lending 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost including interest of construction 
if the estimated property value proves to be inaccurate  the loan may be undersecured 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could cause an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
substantially all of our business is with customers located within mercer county and contiguous counties 
generally  we make loans to small to mid sized businesses  most of which depend on the health of the regional economy for their success 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and performance 
further  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans undersecured 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral to satisfy the debt securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings could be adversely affected 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings would decrease 
in an attempt to mitigate any loan losses we may incur  we maintain an allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  and historical loss experience and delinquency trends among loan types 
however  we cannot predict loan losses with certainty and we cannot assure you that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance 
table of contents based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan losses could reduce our earnings 
loss of our key personnel or an inability to hire and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future operating results are substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior and executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a negative impact on our banking operations because of the loss of their business development skills  lending expertise and community involvement  among other things 
our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and our lending officers and on their relationships with the communities they serve 
although we have employment agreements with certain key personnel  our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key personnel or attract the qualified personnel necessary for the management of our business 
changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
our net income depends primarily upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
different types of assets and liabilities may react differently  and at different times  to changes in market interest rates 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income 
likewise  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
we are unable to accurately predict changes in market interest rates  which are affected by many factors beyond our control  including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in the united states and other financial markets 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions  which may adversely affect our business 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we have not entered into any definitive agreement and we do not have any definitive plans relating to any specific acquisitions 
we will have to integrate any acquisitions into our business 
the difficulties of combining the operations  technologies and personnel of companies we acquire include coordinating and integrating geographically separated organizations and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions and increased competition 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations if any of the above adverse effects were to occur 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from any acquisitions may not be obtained 
competition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability 
we face substantial competition in originating loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including 
table of contents greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans 
in attracting deposits  we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do  which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations and increase our cost of funds 
we also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
government regulation significantly affects our business 
the banking industry is extensively regulated 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  and the fdic deposit insurance funds  not the shareholders of the company 
we are subject to regulation and supervision by the frb 
the bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the occ and  as discussed under the heading regulatory matters in part i  item  is party to an agreement with the occ 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
the bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements  which involve both quantitative measures of our assets and liabilities and qualitative judgments by regulators regarding risks and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements or comply with other regulations could result in actions by regulators that could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise adversely impact operations 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we conduct our business 
such changes may adversely affect us  including our ability to offer new products and services  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory spreads and impose additional costs on us 
the bank is also subject to a number of federal laws which  among other things  require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population  and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti money laundering and customer identification 
the bank s compliance with these laws will be considered by the federal banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions or commence new activities or make new investment in reliance on the glb act 
as a public company  we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the rules or regulations promulgated by the sec or nasdaq 
our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting may not achieve their intended objectives 
our system of internal controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance  and not absolute assurance  that the objectives of the internal control system will be met 
the design of any control system is based  in part  upon the benefits of the control system relative to its costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by management override of control 
in addition  over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
the design of any control system is based in part 
table of contents upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 
because of inherent limitation in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introduction of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 
our information systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
we rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business  including deposit and loan information  as well as various internal management functions 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  network failure  improper operation by our employees  security breaches  computer viruses or intentional attacks by third parties 
any disruption in the operation of our information systems could adversely impact our operations  which may affect our results of operations and financial condition

seidman and dennis pollack  filed a verified complaint and order to show cause in the superior court of new jersey  chancery division  passaic county  against the bank  its directors and certain former directors 
the plaintiffs are disputing the validity of the actions taken by the company s board of directors in december  to reduce the size of the board from fifteen to thirteen  and in january  to include certain qualifications for directors and director nominees in the company s by laws 
specifically  the plaintiffs have asked the court to order four members of the board to stand for election at the annual meeting of shareholders  to invalidate the director qualification by law the company adopted in january  and to declare that lawrence b 
seidman and dennis pollack are qualified to serve as directors  if elected at the annual meeting of shareholders 
the company and the named defendants are defending the actions of the company s board 
regulatory matters on august   the bank entered into a formal agreement with the occ regarding the bank s operations  maintaining specified capital levels  obtaining prior approvals of dividend payments  and other concerns identified in the occ s report of examination for the examination that commenced on january  the agreement also encompasses activities initiated earlier in by the bank to strengthen its board and management supervision  and internal audit and risk management processes 
under the agreement  the bank will not be deemed to be well 
table of contents capitalized for certain regulatory purposes 
such capital category may not  however  accurately represent the bank s general financial condition or prospects 
as a result of the agreement  the bank is not eligible to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary to engage in expanded financial activities such as securities and insurance brokerage 
in addition  the company has elected to decertify as a financial holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act 
a financial holding company may affiliate with financial companies  such as merchant banking  securities and insurance firms  that engage in a broader range of activities than previously permitted for bank holding companies 
neither of these actions will impact current activities and operations of the company or the bank 
on january   the occ commenced its annual examination for the annual period ended september  the occ s report of examination for this examination is expected to be received by the bank in the second quarter of while we believe that we have made significant progress in addressing the concerns raised by the occ  we do not expect the occ to terminate its formal agreement with the bank at this time 
on january   based primarily on the condition of the bank  as determined by the occ at the examination for the annual period ended september   as well as other information  the federal reserve bank of philadelphia issued a supervisory letter to the company 
the supervisory letter sets forth certain provisions with respect to which the reserve bank has requested our compliance  including obtaining prior approvals of dividend payments and any indebtedness other than indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business  as well as refraining from purchasing or redeeming any shares of our stock 
other legal proceedings apart from the matters discussed above  the company and the bank are party  in the ordinary course of business  to litigation involving collection matters  contract claims and other miscellaneous causes of action arising from our business 
we do not consider that any such proceedings depart from usual routine litigation  and in our judgment  our consolidated financial position or results of operations will not be affected materially by the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings

dividends paid per share in totaled 
cash dividends are generally paid quarterly or four times a year 
in the first quarter of  the company paid a cash dividend in the amount of per share on the common stock 
because substantially all of the funds available for the payment of cash dividends are derived from the bank  future cash dividends will depend primarily upon the bank s earnings  financial condition  need for funds  and government policies and regulations applicable to both the bank and the company 
the company has also agreed with the holders of the trust preferred securities issued by subsidiary trusts see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements that the company will not pay dividends if an event of default should occur and remain uncured under the terms of the trust preferred securities

in addition  the bank s formal agreement with the occ provides that the bank may not declare or pay any dividend to the company without the prior written approval of the occ 
in the event that the bank was unable to pay dividends  it would adversely affect the company s ability to pay dividends

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to provide the reader with information pertinent to understanding and assessing yardville national bancorp s results of operations for each of the past three years and financial condition for each of the past two years  as well as selected data for the past five years 
throughout this annual report the terms ynb  company  we  us  our  and corporation will refer to yardville national bancorp  our wholly owned banking subsidiary the yardville national bank the bank  and other subsidiaries as a consolidated entity  except where noted 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of ynb 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set in part i  item  on page critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
ynb s significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
two of these policies  governing the allowance for loan losses and income taxes  are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the audit committee 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  under which we are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors 
those factors include reviews and evaluations of specific loans  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimate losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
we account for income taxes by recognizing the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences  which require judgment of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact ynb s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements include further explanation on the accounting for income taxes

following the execution of the agreement  the board formed a compliance committee which overseas all aspects of compliance with the provisions of the agreement 
on november   we completed a private offering of our common stock to certain accredited investors including members of the board of directors  in order to comply with the capital levels specified in the occ agreement 
yardville national bancorp raised slightly more than million in this offering and contributed it to the bank 
we believe that the actions we took in both before and after the date of the agreement  constitute significant progress in addressing the concerns raised in the referenced examination 
ynb generated double digit increases in net income and earnings per share in a competitive market and challenging regulatory environment in we earned net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million or per diluted share for the year ended december  this represents an increase of and  respectively 
the level of improvement in diluted earnings per share was negatively impacted by the additional shares issued in the fourth quarter of the increase in net income was primarily attributable to solid net interest income growth of million  or  primarily due to consistent commercial loan growth and a basis point increase in our tax equivalent net interest margin to 
partially offsetting the improvement was a million increase in non interest expense and higher income tax expense

net loan chargeoffs were million for compared to million for in  simply better savings was a primary contributor to the increase in deposits for the year 
total deposits increased million or to billion from billion at december  led by the growth in simply better savings  saving deposits increased million to million 
this growth resulted from new customers attracted to the bank as well as existing depositors shifting their balances 
as a result  interest bearing demand deposits and money markets decreased and  respectively 
in addition  as interest rates rose throughout the year  cds or time deposits became more attractive to depositors relative to other deposits 
time deposits increased to million at year end our non interest expense increased due primarily to the increase in salaries and employee benefits 
staffing  and the related benefits costs  increased during due to our continued branch expansion and overall growth 
we have further strengthened staffing to support audit  compliance and loan and credit administration 
as we have grown  our efficiency ratio has remained relatively stable at for compared to for growth in net interest income has helped offset the impact of higher expenses and lower non interest income 
we positioned our balance sheet in to take advantage of gradually increasing interest rates experienced during the year 
we are currently reviewing strategies to position the balance sheet for a lower interest rate environment to minimize the potential risk to net interest income should interest rates decline in late or early while the commercial lending landscape remains a challenge due to a flat yield curve and strong competition for quality loans  we remain optimistic about our loan growth for we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to broaden our lending base by attracting quality commercial borrowers in new markets in we will also continue to expand our retail footprint and attract lower cost core deposits 
we believe this should contribute to a modestly higher net interest margin  improved financial performance and ultimately  increased franchise value during net interest income net interest income is the largest and most significant component of our operating income 
net interest income is the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts and types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
net interest income is also impacted by changes in interest rates and the shape of market yield curves 
the following table sets forth an analysis of net interest income by each major category of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the related yields and costs for the years ended december     and average yields for each year are derived by dividing income by the average balance of the related assets  and average costs are derived by dividing expense by the average balance of the related liabilities 
the yields and costs include fees  costs  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to interest rates

for purposes of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual balances with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
in order to make pre tax income and resultant yield on tax exempt investments and loans on a basis comparable to those on taxable investments and loans  a tax equivalent adjustment is made to interest income 
the tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using the appropriate federal income tax rate for the period and has the effect of increasing interest income by     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively

the federal open market committee fomc increased short term interest rates basis points each of the eight times it met in  raising the fed funds rate from to 
ynb s balance sheet throughout was asset sensitive and  as a result  net interest income and the margin moved higher 
longer term interest rates did not increase as the fomc moved short term rates higher 
the flattening of the treasury yield curve  to varying degrees  limited further improvement in our tax equivalent net interest margin  impacting our fixed rate commercial loan pricing and limiting the increase in our securities yields 
in  interest income rose to million  or  from million in  primarily due to higher interest income on loans 
average interest earning assets increased million or to billion in from billion in loans averaged billion for  an increase of million or compared to billion for during  interest and fees on loans increased million  or  as loan yields increased by basis points to from for the principal factor driving loan yields higher in was our floating rate commercial loans 
approximately of our commercial loan portfolio had floating interest rates at december   typically tied to the prime rate of interest 
in  the average prime rate increased to compared to in approximately million of our floating rate commercial loans have caps 
floating rate commercial loans that have reached their caps totaled million 
these loans  as well as other floating rate loans  would have the effect of restricting the growth in interest income should the prime rate of interest continue to move higher 
we do expect loan yields to continue to move higher during as additional rate increases are expected in the first half of the year 
average securities declined million or to million in from million in due to a portfolio yield of  basis points higher than  interest on securities increased million from and contributed to higher net interest income levels 
based on the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet  securities  principally mortgage 
table of contents backed securities  were purchased with modestly longer durations at or close to par 
the result was a consistent portfolio yielded  in spite of a flat yield curve  without taking excessive interest rate risk 
the combination of greater average interest bearing liabilities  primarily interest bearing deposits  and increased average costs due to the higher interest rate environment  resulted in a million or increase in interest expense 
average interest bearing liabilities rose million to billion  while overall funding costs rose just basis points to during or only of the basis point increase in the federal funds rate during that same period 
we continued the execution of our retail strategy in with the ongoing objective of effectively managing our cost of funds by attracting lower cost deposits through a larger geographic footprint 
in  average savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits grew million or to million  principally due to growth in our simply better savings product 
to a somewhat lesser extent  average time deposits  including cds of  or more  increased million or to million in compared to million in we increased time deposit rates during due to the interest rate environment  funding needs and competitive factors 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits rose million or of the total increase in interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities 
the growth in average non interest bearing demand deposits of million or to million in contributed positively to our net interest margin 
average borrowed funds and subordinated debentures increased million and million  respectively  while related interest costs increased by and basis points to and  respectively 
during and into we strategically replaced floating rate federal home loan bank advances with fixed rate advances as interest rates were rising 
this initiative  in effect  limited the increase in the cost of these funds  which had a positive impact on net interest income and the margin in and we expect this impact to continue into we had million in outstanding subordinated debentures  of which million had floating interest rates tied to spreads over libor  which is the primary cause for the increase in interest expense of million as rates rose during in summary  our solid financial performance in was primarily the result of greater net interest income due  in part  to a higher net interest margin 
by effectively pricing our commercial loans and attracting a better mix of deposits in our new and existing branches we have continued to move our tax equivalent margin higher 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased or basis points to for the twelve months ended december  compared with for the same period in nonaccrual loans averaged million in compared to million in had these nonaccrual loans performed at original contract terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of approximately  in compared to  in and our tax equivalent margin would have been higher by three basis points in and two basis points in we expect the challenge of strong competition for commercial loans and deposits to continue in as short term treasury rates have moved higher and long term rates have remained relatively unchanged  this flattening of the yield curve has impacted earning asset spreads as ynb s cost of funds moved higher 
despite these challenges  we believe our net interest margin should modestly improve during  which is expected to help us achieve our profitability goals 
our formula for success is dependent on meeting commercial loan growth targets and effectively managing our cost of funds by continuing to execute our retail strategy 
in  we will continue to open branches in new and developing markets  promote our brand image  and market ynb s attractive core deposit products like the recently introduced simply better money market in addition to our established simply better savings and checking product offerings 
we expect short term rates to peak in and are reviewing strategies to reduce fhlb advances  if liquidity levels allow  or change the repricing characteristics of these advances from fixed to floating using interest rate swaps in anticipation of lower interest rates 
we are beginning to position our balance sheet to protect net interest income in a lower interest rate environment 
we believe this strategy will give us the best opportunity to increase profitability and franchise value in provision for loan losses we provide for loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the  higher provision is primarily the result of the increased level of net charge offs 
net charge offs were of average loans for the years ended december  and the allowance for loan losses increased by

non interest income we earn fee and other income primarily from service charges on deposit accounts and other banking products and services  and this continues to be a large component of our non interest income 
we also derive non interest income from income on bank owned life insurance boli and net securities gains 
for  non interest income totaled million  a decrease of  or from non interest income represented and of total interest income and non interest income for and  respectively 
non interest income  excluding net securities gains  declined modestly by  or to million for compared to million for the decline is principally due to lower service charge income partially offset by increased other service fee income 
the components of non interest income for the three year period ended december  are presented in the following table 
year ended december  in thousands service charges on deposit accounts other service fees income on bank owned life insurance securities gains  net investment and insurance fees other non interest income total service charges on deposit accounts continue to represent the largest single source of our non interest income 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or  mainly due to a lower volume of overdraft activity 
in addition  to make certain product offerings more competitive  we have modified these products  which has also reduced service charge income 
other service fee income totaled million in  an increase of  or when compared to million in other service fee income is primarily composed of prepayment penalties on loans  automated teller machine fees  visa debit income and wire transfer fees 
in  the increase was primarily attributable to the collection of prepayment penalties on commercial loans of approximately  with no additional purchases of bank owned life insurance boli in  our investment in boli totaled million at year end 
boli assets are single premium policies purchased to offset the costs of deferred compensation plans and other employee benefits 
income on boli is tax free  providing an attractive rate of return while reducing our overall effective tax rate 
income on boli was million in  a decrease of compared to million in the decline in income is a result of a lower interest crediting rate for applicable to boli assets 
net securities gains totaled  during compared to million in the comparable lower level of net gains realized in compared to was primarily due to a lower level of sales in compared to 
table of contents during we repositioned or sold securities to achieve asset and liability objectives  which included enhancing future interest income  liquidity needs and managing interest rate risk 
while non interest income was not a significant part of overall revenues in  we believe the actions we are taking to expand our retail and commercial customer bases should begin to translate into comparatively higher levels of non interest income in the future 
in we expect to generate additional non interest income through fee collection  cash management services revenue and the increased usage of electronic banking services 
non interest expense in  non interest expense totaled million  an increase of million or  compared to million in the largest increases in non interest expense in were primarily in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and marketing expenses 
to a lesser extent  audit and examination fees  outside services and processing fees  and attorney s fees also contributed to higher non interest expenses in our efficiency ratio  which provides a measure of our operating efficiency  is total non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income plus non interest income 
we also measure our efficiency ratio on a tax equivalent basis 
our efficiency ratio was slightly higher in  finishing the year at compared to in on a tax equivalent basis  our efficiency ratio was and for and  respectively 
our efficiency ratio for was basically unchanged as expenses associated with our retail strategy  additional expenses associated with our growth and to a lesser extent  the costs associated with meeting regulatory requirements were in line with our growth in net interest income 
based on projected growth in branches and expenses associated with our retail strategy  our efficiency ratio could move modestly higher in the following table presents the major components of non interest expense for the years ended december    and year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense  net equipment expense marketing outside services and processing fees audit and examination fees directors and committee fees communication and postage stationery and supplies attorneys fees insurance amortization of subordinated debentures expense fdic insurance premium deposit intangible amortization ore expense other total 
table of contents salaries and employee benefits  which represent the largest portion of non interest expense  increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  salaries rose million or to million in  primarily due to new hires in  merit pay increases and the full impact of employees hired in staffing additions in and resulted from our continued branch expansion  enhanced regulatory compliance and risk management 
benefits expense increased  principally due to higher health benefit costs and payroll taxes associated with the increase in full time employees 
also contributing to the increase in benefits expense were costs associated with our executive deferred compensation plan 
net occupancy expense increased  or to million in from million in the increase was principally due to costs associated with our branch expansion  including rent  taxes and associated maintenance costs 
occupancy costs are expected to rise in as we continue to open new branches as part of our retail strategy and operate a larger branch network 
by consistently promoting our new branches  while marketing our products and services and enhancing our brand image  we have attracted new depositors to ynb 
we believe marketing is an important component of our retail strategy 
as a result  marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in outside services and processing expenses  audit and examination fees  and attorney fees increased   and to million  million  and  respectively 
outside services and processing expenses include services provided by third parties  outsourced services and consulting fees 
the increase in outside services and processing fees primarily resulted from increased consulting costs related to regulatory compliance 
the higher audit and examination fees resulted from costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  compliance and tax services 
attorney fees increased due to costs associated with problem loan workout  various regulatory compliance issues and shareholder relations 
in  we anticipate  and have budgeted for  increased attorney s fees associated with a proxy contest at our annual meeting of shareholders and related litigation 
other expenses totaled million in compared to million in other expenses are comprised of a variety of professional fees  expenses associated with the origination and management of loans and other operating expenses 
we will continue to make investments in technology  our retail strategy  and delivery systems to attract new customers and provide the ongoing quality products and services our customers expect 
income tax we have identified accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy 
the provision for income taxes  comprised of federal and state income taxes  was million for  an increase of million when compared to million for the provisions for income taxes in and were at effective rates of and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate resulted from the greater percentage increase in taxable income compared to tax free income 
financial condition total assets total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million or  as compared to total assets of billion at december  this growth in our balance sheet is attributable to higher commercial loan balances funded primarily by deposits 
loans increased to billion at december  from billion at december   while deposits increased to billion from billion during the same time period 

table of contents the combination of our relationship banking philosophy  commercial lending strength and retail growth all contributed to our consistent asset growth in we expect loan growth to continue in as we expand our markets and promote our established and new loan products and services 
loans in we achieved solid loan growth of or million to billion at december  from billion at december  in a very competitive and challenging environment 
commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans experienced growth of million and million  respectively in our focus and strength as a commercial business lender was again shown in our results 
we believe the combination of a strong new jersey real estate market  increased business activity and additional loan opportunities from new and established relationships should result in continued loan growth in commercial loans  which include commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans  grew  due primarily to growth in our mercer county market and the developing hunterdon and middlesex markets in while we were able to grow our loan portfolio in  the growth was slower than the million  or loan growth we produced in the slower loan growth  principally in our commercial loan portfolio  was due to several factors  including a relatively higher level of commercial loan payoffs and a decline in commercial loan participations 
total commercial loan payoffs during totaled million compared to million in in addition  commercial loan participations declined million in compared to an increase of million in increased competition was reflected in aggressive pricing and terms offered by competitors in with the goal of moving our net interest margin higher  we made our lending decisions with that key financial objective in mind and did not aggressively compete for or retain business that did not meet our profitability and interest rate risk objectives 
we focused our efforts on our established loan customers who value our relationship banking philosophy

our underwriting standards include requiring independent appraisals  periodic property inspection  analysis of the quality and experience of the organization or developer managing each property  and evaluation of the cash flow capability of the borrower to repay the loan 
in addition to real estate collateral  the majority of our commercial loans are secured by business assets and most are secured by personal guarantees and other assets of the principals 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or in  to billion from billion in the commercial real estate portfolio includes mortgage loans on owner occupied and tenanted investment properties investor occupied  and construction and development loans 
the primary area of growth in was construction and development loans  which increased by million or to million at december  investor and owner occupied commercial mortgages are principally secured by professional office buildings  retail stores  shopping centers and industrial developments generally with maturities of five to fifteen years 
construction and development loans primarily fund residential and commercial projects  and to a lesser extent  acquisition of land for future development 
residential construction loans include single family  multi family  and condominium projects 
commercial construction loans include office and professional development  retail development and other commercial related projects

these loans are subject to risks similar to those that impact our commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the other significant industry classification is loans to the services industry 
there are no significant concentrations of loans to any particular sector of the services industry 
while we do not believe that these loan concentrations present any undue risk  we will continue to monitor loan concentrations by industry classification and diversify risk as we deem appropriate

home equity loans and lines represented of total consumer loans at the end of like the commercial lending portfolio  the majority of our consumer loan portfolio is also secured by collateral 
the consumer loan marketplace continues to be very competitive 
our larger branch network and targeted home equity promotions contributed to the modest increase in consumer loans in despite a higher interest rate environment 
in  one of our objectives is to continue our lending relationship banking model while refocusing our efforts to generate additional commercial loan business by the introduction of a credit scored loan product for small business in ynb s home mercer county market and the developing markets of hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties 
commercial loan growth will continue to be an important contributor in enhancing our net interest margin  profitability and franchise value 
increased competition  borrowers concerns over the economy  real estate market values in the markets we serve  and interest rates  among other factors  could adversely affect our loan growth and keep us from maintaining the growth rates we experienced in and prior periods 
asset quality commercial lending is one of ynb s most critical functions 
while the most profitable part of our business is commercial lending  the risk and complexity of that business is also the greatest 
through our lending and credit functions we continuously review our loan portfolio for credit risk 
during  as part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by sox  we improved policies  procedures and processes  which we believe will enhance overall asset quality moving forward 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets rose to at december  compared to at the same date in during 
table of contents the fourth quarter of  we identified an million commercial relationship that rapidly deteriorated 
that loan was placed on nonaccrual and before year end we had charged off million of the loan relationship 
while we believe overall asset quality to be sound  over the last few years certain larger credits have increased nonperforming asset levels and net loan charge offs  which has resulted in a higher provision for loan losses and reduced net income 
the following table sets forth nonperforming assets in our loan portfolio by type for the five year period ended december  nonperforming assets december  in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial real estate commercial and industrial residential consumer total nonaccrual loans restructured loans loans days or more past due residential consumer total loans days or more past due total nonperforming loans other real estate total nonperforming assets for the five year period ended december   nonperforming assets averaged million 
nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned 
nonperforming assets increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  three nonperforming loan relationships made up approximately of total nonperforming assets at december  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned were at december  compared to at december  there was no other real estate owned at december  or december  nonperforming loans consist of loans on a nonaccrual basis  loans whose terms have been restructured because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower and loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments and have not been classified as nonaccrual 
nonaccrual loans totaled million or of total loans at december  compared to million or of total loans at the same date in nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans account for approximately of total nonaccrual loans 
there were no restructured loans at december  or december  our policies regarding nonaccrual loans vary by loan type 
generally  commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual when they are days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection  or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
residential mortgage loans are not generally placed on nonaccrual status unless the value of the real estate has deteriorated to the point that a potential loss of principal or interest exists 
subsequent payments are credited to income only if collection of 
table of contents principal is not in doubt 
if principal and interest payments are brought contractually current  and future collectibility is reasonably assured  loans are returned to accrual status 
restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until collectibility improves and a satisfactory payment history is established  generally six consecutive monthly payments 
we believe that the sound credit culture in place and enhanced credit risk administration  which includes strict underwriting standards  should result in lower levels of nonperforming assets and an improved credit quality profile in factors beyond our control  such as adverse economic and business conditions  could result in higher nonperforming asset levels  which would have a negative impact on our financial performance 
additionally  since the majority of our loans are backed by real estate collateral  if it were necessary to liquidate our real estate collateral during a period of reduced real estate values  earnings would be negatively impacted 
allowance for loan losses we have identified the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
ynb s methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance consists of a number of significant elements  which include specific allowances for impaired loans  an allocated allowance for each specific loan pool  and an unallocated allowance to cover inherent loan losses within a given loan pool  which have not been otherwise reviewed or measured on an individual basis 
the formal evaluation process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses takes place quarterly 
as part of our formal process our commercial lending staff reviews  evaluates and rates our commercial loans at origination based on their respective risks 
risk classifications range from to or from minimal risk to loss 
for more detailed information on risk classifications please see note e in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
internal loan review staff  independent of loan and credit administration  formally evaluate risk ratings and classifications 
additionally  the criticized and classified assets committee  comprised of key executive and senior officers  meets monthly to review  among other things  criticized asset trends  and to review pertinent information about classified assets with our lending officers 
if necessary  loans that fall into criticized categories are further evaluated for impairment as called for in statement of financial accounting standards fasb no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the credit administration staff validates all impairment testing and reserve allocations for all impaired loans each quarter 
reserves associated with these loans are based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment  which is normally the liquidation of collateral  but could also include discounted future cash flows 
during  there were several enhancements made to the allowance process 
at year end  there were a limited number of broad loan pools evaluated to perform the quarterly allowance analysis 
we refined our commercial loan analysis  creating individual pools based on specific commercial categories or grouping of borrowers with similar characteristics eg contractors  health care facilities to better measure the risk in each by borrower group or loan type 
the reserve percentage assigned to each risk rating category within in each pool is determined quarterly from historical loan loss rates based on an eight quarter rolling trend using migration analysis 
in addition  we use our judgment concerning the anticipated impact on credit risk of economic conditions  real estate values  interest rates and business activity 
allocations for the allowance for loan losses are determined after the review described above 
factors used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the amounts and trends of criticized loans  results of regulatory examinations as the allowance for loan losses is typically an integral part of the examination process and economic data associated with new jersey s real estate market 
after the conclusion of this evaluation  we present the quarterly review of the loan loss reserve to the board of directors for their approval 
we provide for probable loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology

we also measure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing coverage of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans decreased to at december  compared to at december   primarily as the result of the increase in nonperforming loans 
it is our assessment  based on our judgment and analysis  that the allowance was appropriate in relation to the credit risk at december  loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for loan losses  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off  if any  are added to the allowance 
net loan charge offs were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was for and  compared to for we recognize that despite our best efforts to manage credit risk  losses will occur 
in times of economic slowdown  either within our markets or nationally  the risk inherent in our loan portfolio may increase 
many of our loans are 
table of contents secured by real estate collateral 
any adverse trends in our real estate markets could have a significant negative effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and the level of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to economic conditions and other factors  the timing and amount of loan losses will also be dependent on the specific financial condition of our borrowers 
while the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed to be adequate for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires management s estimates  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
changes in these estimates could impact the provisions charged to expense in future periods 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated 
the allowance contains an unallocated portion to cover inherent losses within a given loan category which have not been otherwise reviewed or measured on an individual basis and is distributed among each loan category 
this unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance is important to maintain the overall allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future loan losses may occur 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any category of loans

afs securities are reported at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax  recognized in stockholders equity 
the unrealized loss on securities available for sale increased to million  net of taxes  compared to  for the same period in  reflecting the increase in market interest rates during volatility in market interest rates in created opportunities to reposition securities to achieve asset and liability objectives  which resulted in net securities gains of  investment securities are classified as held to maturity when ynb has the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost or book value 
these securities totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in investment securities was due primarily to an million increase in the municipal bond portfolio 
municipal bonds increased 
table of contents to million at december  from million at december  municipal bonds were purchased to reduce our overall effective tax rate and enhance the tax equivalent yield of the portfolio in we expect to purchase additional municipal bonds for these reasons during during  based on the repricing characteristics of our loan portfolio and our overall interest rate risk position  we maintained a modestly longer portfolio duration 
with approximately of ynb s floating rate commercial loans repricing higher throughout  in an increasing interest rate environment  our balance sheet was well positioned which resulted in greater interest income 
the duration of our portfolio at december  was years compared to years at december  the effect of a longer duration portfolio while longer term rates remained relatively stable and short term rates increased during was a higher yielding portfolio with consistent cash flows and protection should interest rates move lower 
additionally  mortgage backed securities purchased in were primarily at prices at or below par  mitigating the risk of a lower yield due to premium amortization 
the improved yield on the afs portfolio contributed to the increase in the overall securities yield to for compared to for we evaluate all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine whether the loss is other than temporary 
at december   management determined that all unrealized losses were temporary in nature 
this conclusion was based on several factors  including the strong credit quality of the securities with unrealized losses  the performing nature of these securities and the low level and short time frame of the unrealized losses 
we believe that the unrealized losses in the securities portfolios were caused by changes in interest rates  market credit spreads  and perceived and actual changes in prepayment speeds on mbs

mbs securities issued by fnma  fhlmc and gnma totaled million  million and million  respectively at december  included in our mortgage backed securities portfolio at december  were million of agency named collateralized mortgage obligations cmos compared to million of total cmo balances at december  these securities provide a significant source of liquidity through the monthly cash flow of principal and interest 
cash flows from the mortgage backed securities portfolios declined to million in compared to million in due to comparatively slower prepayment speeds and the smaller size of the mbs portfolio 
like all securities we own  mbs are sensitive to changes in interest rates  increasing and decreasing in market value as interest rates rise and fall 
as interest rates rise  cash flows from mbs prepayments generally decline while the duration of these assets extend 
on the other hand  when interest rates fall  prepayments generally increase  which may reduce the yield on mortgage backed securities  and proceeds are reinvested at lower yields 
our investment portfolio strategy  which includes duration targets  will depend on the overall interest rate risk position of our balance sheet and other asset and liability objectives  including capital requirements and liquidity needs 
should the composition of our floating rate loan portfolio shift to a more fixed rate profile  then we would anticipate purchasing securities with shorter weighted average lives  durations or maturity dates 
we continually review and reposition the securities portfolios to adjust for current and anticipated interest rate and yield 
table of contents curve levels 
based on potential liquidity needs and market conditions  we anticipate limited or no portfolio growth in deposits total deposits reached billion at december   an increase of million or from billion for the same time period in with deposits representing our principal funding source  our focus continued in to further expand our geographic footprint  strengthen our brand image  introduce new products and services and attract lower cost core deposits  which should enable us to more effectively manage our deposit costs 
this retail strategy  we believe  is contributing to the increased value of our franchise 
bringing our relationship driven brand of banking to new markets and neighborhoods is a critical factor in attracting a lower cost diversified deposit base to fund our loan growth at targeted margin spreads 
during we opened three new branches in our mercer county market  in addition to our second bucks county branch in morrisville  pennsylvania in december 
ynb also opened its first branch in the attractive ocean county  new jersey market in january several more branches are expected to open later in in the developing markets of hunterdon and middlesex counties in new jersey 
the generation of additional deposits is preferable to the use of wholesale funding vehicles  such as fhlb advances  and other higher cost funding alternatives 
the cost of interest bearing deposits increased to for compared to in as we increased rates to compete for deposits in a higher interest rate environment 
the basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits is approximately of the basis point increase in the average fed funds rate  indicative of the positive results of our retail strategy and our enhanced capability to manage our cost of funds

table of contents average savings deposits increased million during with the cost of savings deposits increasing to from in in the first quarter of  we introduced simply better savings  a competitively priced tiered product 
the successful introduction of this product accounted for nearly all of the growth and increased cost of savings deposits experienced in we have marketed this product extensively during new branch openings  as well as throughout our branch system  with excellent results 
in we opened  new accounts with balances of million at year end 
a portion of this growth was from our existing customers who shifted their simply better checking and other deposit balances to obtain the higher rate on simply better savings 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased while money market deposits declined 
during the cost of average interest bearing and money market deposits rose and basis points to and  respectively 
simply better checking balances decreased million to million in we view these balances positively  specifically that the balances maintained in this comparatively lower rate product illustrate our success in fostering and establishing new customer relationships 
at december   after only two years out in the marketplace  we have accumulated million in simply better checking and savings balances 
as interest rates increased during  certificates of deposit cds  or time deposits  became more popular with depositors 
total average time deposits  consisting of both cds of  or more and other time deposits  increased or million to million from million in the cd portfolio s average months to maturity was approximately months at december  compared to approximately months at december  the comparatively shorter average maturity and higher interest rate environment should result in higher costs on new and maturing cds  which would increase the overall costs of our cds 
the average cost of time deposits increased basis points in to from in at december  average time deposits represented of average total deposits compared to during we anticipate time deposits will represent a larger portion of our deposit base due principally to competitive and customer preference factors 
the following table details amounts and maturities for certificates of deposit of  or more for the years indicated december  in thousands maturity range within three months after three months but within six months after six months but within twelve months after twelve months total the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits was million  a million or increase over the average balance for new and existing business relationships primarily accounted for the increase in interest free balances in as we cultivate and further develop new and existing loan relationships  we attract and generally require non interest bearing deposits from these customers 
we believe we can continue to grow these margin enhancing non interest bearing deposits as we introduce our enhanced business checking product line and relationship banking philosophy in new markets 
to supplement our in market deposit growth we utilize alternative deposit sources  which are generally more expensive 
these sources include surrogate s deposits minor trust accounts  money market balances acquired through an independent third party intermediary reserve funds and cds marketed nationally through a computer based software service 
surrogate s deposits are acquired through an annual competitive bidding process from various counties in new jersey 
as a result of the bidding process  at january  we had million in 
table of contents surrogate s deposits from nine counties in new jersey 
at january   we had million in surrogate s deposits 
reserve funds  which are priced at a premium over the fed funds rate  decreased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of cds acquired through the computer based software service declined million to million in management has found that these funding sources have been dependable management tools for liquidity and funding purposes but typically tend to be more costly then in market deposits 
during we were able to reduce and replace these funding sources  as discussed above  with comparatively less expensive deposits generated through our retail strategy 
in we will continue to follow our retail strategy in order to attract lower cost core deposits 
we believe this will result in a higher net interest margin and increased levels of net interest income 
to realize these benefits we will continue to open additional branches in developing markets and introduce new products and services 
we will complete our simply better core product line by introducing our simply better money market deposit account  giving us the best opportunity to expand customer relationships 
we realize the full benefits of our retail strategy will take time 
should a greater part of our deposit base be in higher cost time deposits and alternative funding sources in we would anticipate pressures on achieving net interest margin and net interest income objectives 
borrowed funds borrowed funds  excluding subordinated debentures  decreased million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million in fhlb advances partially offset by increases in esop and other borrowed funds 
at december   total borrowed funds  excluding subordinated debentures  represented of total assets compared to at the same date in fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  matured or called advances were retired in as part of our strategy to reduce our reliance on this funding source 
in anticipation of higher interest rates in  in december we began replacing floating rate advances with fixed rate callable advances having lockout periods of one to two years and final maturity dates of five to ten years 
from december to year end we replaced million in floating rate advances 
these advances have an average rate of and have proven to be comparatively less expensive then the libor based floating rate borrowings they replaced 
our fhlb advance portfolio is collateralized by securities and mortgage loans residential and commercial 
at december   we had million in advances collateralized by securities and million by mortgage loans 
as additional commercial and residential mortgage loans qualify as collateral  it is our intent to replace securities collateral with mortgage collateral to enhance our liquidity profile if and when advances are renewed 
our fhlb advance position at december  consisted of million in callable advances and million in term funding 
of the callable borrowings  million have call dates in callable advances have terms of five to ten years and are callable after periods ranging from three months to five years 
based on year end interest rate levels and our analysis we anticipate there will be potential calls in of million and an additional million in with interest rates expected to move higher through the first half of the likelihood of additional fhlb advance calls should increase 
a drop in interest rates would slow call activity 
subject to liquidity needs  we will retire advances if they are called in we are also analyzing strategies to change the pricing characteristics of our fixed rate convertible advances using swaps 
we will base our decisions regarding the use of swaps on several factors including our view of future interest rates and asset and liability management objectives 
excluding subordinated debentures  borrowed funds averaged million in  an increase of less than from the million reported in the average cost of these funds  driven primarily by fhlb advances  increased basis points to during compared to during due to the higher cost of floating rate advances and call of certain lower cost advances 
we expect the costs associated with our fhlb advance portfolio to be comparatively stable in 
table of contents borrowed funds also include a loan related to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
in november  the esop trust purchased  shares of ynb s common stock with million borrowed from a nonaffiliated financial institution 
we believe one of the benefits we should realize from our retail strategy is a reduced reliance on borrowed funds as we grow our deposit base 
we may utilize borrowed funds for our earning asset growth not provided by deposit generation and for asset and liability management purposes 
within approved policy guidelines  we may continue to use borrowed funds as an alternative funding source or to achieve business  and asset and liability objectives 
subordinated debentures we have obtained a portion of capital needed to support the growth of the bank and for other purposes through the sale of subordinated debentures of yardville national bancorp to subsidiary statutory business trusts of yardville national bancorp trusts 
these trusts exist for the sole purpose of raising funds through the issuance of trust preferred securities  typically in private placement transactions  and investing the proceeds in the purchase of the subordinated debentures 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is identical to the interest rate on the trust preferred securities 
subordinated debentures are the sole assets of each trust and each trust is obligated to distribute all proceeds resulting from any redemption of the subordinated debentures  whether voluntary or upon maturity  to holders of its trust preferred securities 
yardville national bancorp s obligation with respect to the subordinated debentures  when viewed together with the obligations of each trust with respect to its trust preferred securities  provides a full and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis by yardville national bancorp of the obligations of each trust to pay amounts when due on the trust preferred securities of each respective trust 
the following table sets forth our trust subsidiaries as of december   along with the transaction date  principal amount of subordinated debentures issued  interest rate of subordinated debentures  maturity date of subordinated debentures and date on which redemption of subordinated debentures is permitted

the proceeds from capital trust vi were used to meet cash flow needs of the holding company  which included contributions of capital to the bank to support growth 
the cost of subordinated debentures increased basis points to in compared to in floating rate subordinated debentures

such obligations include obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements  as well as payments on deferred compensation and postretirement benefits 
we have one capital lease obligation with no other significant long term contractual obligations 
time deposits are shown at the maturity date 
borrowed funds are shown based on their amortization schedule 
noncallable borrowed funds are shown at the maturity date  while callable borrowed funds are shown at either the call date  if a call was deemed likely at december   or otherwise at the maturity date 
subordinated debentures are shown at the maturity date 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements as these commitments may expire without being drawn upon based upon our past historical experience 
we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  both of which involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk for letters of credit is managed by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying the same credit policies we apply to all activities with credit risk 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the contract amounts of off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  and for commitments to extend credit were million and million  respectively  and for letters of credit were million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit may expire without being drawn upon  and therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements 
further discussion of our other commitments and contingent liabilities is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have commitments and obligations under other postretirement benefit plans as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset and liability management asset and liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring  and managing of market risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk and the appropriate use of capital  while maximizing profitability 
our asset and liability committee alco provides oversight to the asset and liability process 
this committee consists of both senior management and independent members of the board of directors 
alco recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to 
table of contents interest rates  and liquidity and capital limits for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on a monthly basis and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure due to changes in balance sheet composition and or market interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by alco and approved by the board of directors 
one of the primary goals of asset and liability management is to prudently maximize net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk 
the risk to net interest income is derived from the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between assets and liabilities 
market and interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
we seek to manage our asset and liability portfolios to help reduce any adverse impact on net interest income and earnings caused by fluctuating interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times  assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts  short and long term interest rates may change by different amounts  the expected life of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change  and interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses and other sources of earnings 
the primary goals of our interest rate risk management are to control exposure to interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet  determine the appropriate risk level given our strategic objectives  and manage the risk consistent with alco and the board of directors approved limits and guidelines 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short and long term horizons 
our alco meets monthly to discuss pertinent asset and liability issues 
on a quarterly basis  we provide a detailed review of our interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
we manage and control interest rate risk by identifying and quantifying interest rate risk exposures through the use of net interest income simulation and economic value at risk models 
both measures may change periodically as the balance sheet composition and underlying assumptions change 
we also use a traditional gap analysis that complements the simulation and economic value at risk modeling 
the gap analysis does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also does not fully account for embedded options  caps and floors 
the gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
one measure of interest rate risk is the gap position  which is defined as the difference between the dollar volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time as a percentage of total assets 
a positive gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds that of interest rate sensitive liabilities within comparable time periods 
a negative gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds that of interest rate sensitive assets within comparable time periods 
as indicated in the table  our one year gap position at december  was 
throughout we have maintained a positive gap position during a period of gradually higher interest rates 
the combination of increased prime related commercial loans  converting floating rate fhlb advances into fixed rate callable advances and simply better savings deposits resulted in a positive gap of at june  the gap change that has taken place in the second half of has largely been asset driven 
the reduction of the positive gap position in the second half of resulted from increased fixed rate commercial loans  slower investment portfolio prepayment speeds and certain floating rate commercial loans reaching their interest rate caps 
floating rate commercial loans with caps totaled million at december   of which million have reached their caps 
the weighted average cap rate is and the caps have a weighted average life of months 
from a liability perspective  fhlb advances have shortened with the increase in the fed funds rate 
we believe that as this increasing rate cycle ends  our gap is moving in the proper direction to eventually be in a better position when rates start to move lower 

table of contents gaps  as a static measurement  cannot capture the effects of embedded options  caps or floors on assets and liabilities 
generally  a financial institution with a positive gap position will most likely experience an increase in net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 

table of contents included in the analysis of our gap position are certain savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits  which are less sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest bearing sources of funds 
in determining the sensitivity of such deposits  we review the movement of our deposit rates relative to market rates over the last months 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities december  more than more than more than more than under six months one year two years five years ten years six through through through through and not in thousands months one year two years five years ten years repricing total assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits available for sale securities investment securities loans other assets  net total assets liabilities and stockholders equity non interest bearing demand savings and interest bearing demand money market certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits total deposits borrowed funds subordinated debentures other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap derivative instruments notional amounts gap after derivative instruments cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets 
table of contents simulation modeling we believe that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides a more meaningful measure of interest rate risk than gap analysis 
our simulation model measures the volatility of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
we dynamically model our interest income and interest expenses over specified time periods under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
we assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of possible strategies for responding to them 
we measure the sensitivity of net interest income over and month time horizons  based on assumptions approved by alco and ratified by the board of directors 
the board has established certain policy limits for the potential volatility of net interest income as projected by our simulation model 
in our base case simulation the composition of the balance sheet is kept static 
volatility is measured from a base case where interest rates are assumed to be flat and is expressed as the percentage change  from the base case  in net interest income over and months periods with a change in interest rates of plus and minus basis points over a month period and continuation of rates at that level for the second year 
our alco policy has established that net interest income sensitivity is acceptable if net interest income in the base case scenario is within a change in net interest income in the first twelve months and within change over the two year time frame 
the following table reflects the estimated change in net interest income from the base case scenario for a one and two year period based on our december  balance sheet percentage change in net interest income change in market interest rates basis points flat basis points based on our simulation analysis  we believe our interest rate risk position remains fairly balanced over the next months whether we experience either rising or falling interest rates 
our risk to increasing interest rates in year two is reflective of the impact to net interest income when floating rate commercial loans reach their caps and interest rates paid on deposits and called fhlb advances increase 
while we are still in a position to take advantage of gradually increasing interest rates in our simulation results have become less asset sensitive over the last several months due to shorter liability repricing and more caps on floating rate commercial loans that were engaged 
we believe  however  that the interest rate cycle of increasing rates will be ending some time in the second half of as a result we are assessing strategies for improved financial performance in a lower interest rate environment 
the simulation results are showing more risk to a lower rate environment than our gap might indicate 
this is because lower interest rates over the next two years will create more floating rate commercial loans once again as rates fall below caps 
in order to reduce risk in the next months and position the month scenario to benefit from lower rates we will consider lengthening bond maturities and moving funding shorter 
one way of creating a shorter funding structure would be to use interest rate swaps to change the profile of fixed rate fhlb advances 
we also measure  through simulation analysis  the impact to net interest income based on our balance sheet growth projections growth scenario in addition to rate ramps or rate increases or decreases greater than over and month periods 
in our growth scenario we see similar results to net interest income assuming expected changes in balances sheet composition 
due to the assumptions used in preparing our simulation analysis  actual outcomes could differ significantly from the simulation outcomes 

table of contents economic value at risk we also measure long term interest rate risk through the economic value of equity eve model 
this model involves projecting cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a long time horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
our eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the variance in the economic value of equity is measured as a percentage of the present value of equity 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
we use the sensitivity of eve principally to measure the exposure of equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long time horizon 
the following table lists our percentage change in eve in a plus or minus basis point rate shock at december  and the policy guideline is 
percentage change in eve change in market interest rates rate shock basis points basis points based on the underlying assumptions  we were within our policy guideline at year end and the eve model has become more balanced with improvement in both a higher and lower rate shock scenario 
negative convexity declined each quarter that fhlb advances were paid down in management believes that as our advances move closer to their maturity dates and become a smaller portion of our funding base that their negative impact on our longer term interest rate risk profile will moderate over time 
continued growth in our core deposit base will also contribute to an improving interest rate risk profile 
our focus has shifted to our risk to lower interest rates as we believe the likelihood of lower rates is now more probable then interest rates moving an additional basis points from rates at the end of the closer we feel the rate cycle is nearing its peak the more willingness there will be to purchase longer term mbs pools  municipal bonds or make fixed rate loans to improve our risk to lower interest rates 
we will continue to closely monitor our longer term rate exposures and evaluate strategies to reduce risk while still achieving financial goals 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the previously discussed interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in the simulation and eve analyses require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
there are many factors that management evaluates when constructing the assumptions used in short term and long term interest rate risk models 
one of the most important assumptions involves deposits without fixed maturity dates 
these include non interest bearing demand  interest bearing demand  savings and money market deposits  and represent a significant portion of our deposit base 
we believe these deposits are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than other interest bearing assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
the balance of these deposits and the rates paid on them may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates  competition  or by the fact that customers may add to or withdraw these deposits at any time at no cost 
these characteristics and the lack of a maturity date makes modeling these deposits for both simulation and eve purposes very difficult 
a modest change in the maturity term or repricing characteristics can result in very different outcomes 
because each financial institution assigns different repricing and maturity terms to these non maturity deposits  comparing risk between institutions without understanding the treatment of non maturity deposits has limited value 
another source of uncertainty reflects the options embedded in many of our financial instruments  which include loans  investments and callable fhlb advances 
to deal with the many uncertainties when constructing either short or long term interest rate risk measurements  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
assumptions are reviewed periodically and changes are made when deemed appropriate 
although the models discussed above provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on ynb s net interest income or economic value of equity and may differ from actual results 

table of contents we believe that any changes to interest rate levels are likely to occur gradually 
we continue to monitor our gap position and rate ramp and shock analyses to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on assets  sell securities  enter into derivative financial instruments  or seek funding sources with different repricing characteristics in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk changes 
derivatives we use and in the future may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in the results of operations or in other comprehensive income  depending on the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction 
derivative interest rate contracts may include interest rate swaps  caps and floors  and are used to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during we entered into fair value hedges  which initially had the effect of increasing net interest income and modestly enhancing the net interest margin 
more importantly  we were able to competitively price two year cds to fund our floating rate commercial loan growth and provide protection against falling interest rates 
by entering into million in notional value pay floating swaps designated as fair value hedges at inception we were able to more closely match the repricing characteristics of the cds with the loans  and lock in spreads of approximately basis points for the period of the swaps should rates either rise or fall 
we understood that the initial interest benefit realized in of  would become negative during if the prime rate continued to increase 
the negative impact to net interest income during was  as libor increased throughout the year 
the interest rate swaps we entered into in will begin to mature in may of financial derivatives involve to some degree  interest rate  market and credit risk 
interest rate swaps represent our only derivative transactions and credit risk is limited to the periodic exchange of net interest payments for the remaining maturity of the transactions 
this results in a credit risk significantly less than the million notional amount 
not all elements of interest rate  market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial or other derivatives  and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market characteristics  among other reasons 
liquidity risk the objective of effective liquidity management is to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of ynb at the most reasonable cost 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or unexpected deposit outflows or other cash needs 
alco is responsible for liquidity risk management 
this committee recommends liquidity policy guidelines to the board of directors for approval 
alco reviews forecasted liquidity needs and the adequacy of deposits and other alternative funding sources to meet these needs 
each month we present detailed reports to the board on our liquidity position  including compliance with limits and guidelines 
as part of liquidity risk management  we have developed a detailed contingency funding plan 
on a quarterly basis  alco reviews the adequacy of funding in adverse environments due to changes in interest rates  credit markets or other external risks through its contingency funding report 
traditional sources of liquidity include deposit growth and scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans and principal cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
we emphasize building and maintaining customer deposits through the execution of our retail strategy and our relationship banking philosophy 
deposit rates and levels are monitored  and trends and significant changes are reported up through alco by ynb s pricing committee 
our pricing committee  an arm of alco  is made up of senior officers and makes deposit pricing decisions in relation to funding needs on a weekly basis consistent with our liquidity policy objectives 
we have used and may continue to use borrowed funds to support and enhance liquidity 
in addition to the ongoing execution of our retail strategy  which has increased core deposits  we also utilize alternative funding sources like the nationwide computer software based service to raise funds through placement of cds to bolster liquidity and fund loan growth 
brokered cd facilities are also available as another source of liquidity 
under our agreement with the occ we would be required to obtain a waiver from the fdic to acquire brokered cds 
in the first quarter of we applied for and received approval from the fdic to utilize this funding source 
the waiver  good until march  will allow us to use brokered cds when and if we deem appropriate 
mortgage backed securities represented 
table of contents of total securities at december  and generated substantial cash flows of approximately million during  which strengthened liquidity 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mbs are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates and competition 
we are eligible to borrow additional funds from the fhlb subject to its stock and collateral requirements  and individual advance proposals based on fhlb credit standards 
fhlb advances are collateralized by securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans 
subject to collateral requirements  we also maintained lines of credit totaling approximately million at december  with the fhlb and three brokerage firms 
we also have the ability to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
we also maintain unsecured federal funds lines totaling million with six correspondent banks for daily funding needs 
the company pays dividends to stockholders and interest due on subordinated debentures 
the principal source of funding for these payments generally comes from dividends from the bank 
under the agreement with the occ and the supervisory letter from the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  prior regulatory approval is required for dividend payments by both the bank and the company 
we received approval from both of these regulatory agencies to pay dividends in the first quarter of by executing our retail strategy in we further strengthened our liquidity profile 
the generation of core deposits in our expanding branch network has provided a reliable stable source of funding 
in addition to cash flows generated from mbs  we hold a diversified portfolio of marketable securities from which liquidity could be promptly generated 
total unpledged securities were approximately million at december  effective liquidity planning and management will be critical in maintaining adequate liquidity levels while funding loan growth at a reasonable cost to achieve our profitability goals in capital management we manage capital in a highly regulated environment which requires a balance between earning the highest return for stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels for proper risk management and satisfying regulatory requirements 
our capital management is designed to generate attractive returns on equity to our stockholders and to assure that we are always well capitalized  or otherwise meet capital targets set by regulatory authorities  while having the necessary capital for our future expansion plans as part of our retail strategy 
a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity of million or resulted from earnings of million  proceeds of million from common shares issued in a private equity offering in november  proceeds of million and  from exercised stock options and shares issued through our dividend reinvestment plan  respectively   from allocated esop shares  and an increase of  associated with the fair market adjustment related to the allocation of shares from the esop 
also contributing to the increase was the recognition of a  expense  related to the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding under yardville national bancorp s stock option plan  provided that such stock options become vested on december  the increase in stockholders equity was partially offset by cash dividend payments of million and a negative adjustment to equity of million from the depreciation in market value of securities available for sale 
we have an employee stock ownership plan esop that permits eligible employees to share in our growth through stock ownership 
in may  the esop purchased an additional  shares from our k plan for  the ynb stock fund  a fund offered through our k plan  was discontinued in may the esop financed the stock purchased with a loan from a nonaffiliated financial institution 
the loan was for a term of two years and was paid in full at december  in november  the esop purchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
the esop funded the transaction by borrowing approximately million from an unaffiliated financial institution 
the balance of unallocated esop shares at december  was million 
the annual expenses associated with the esop were  in   in and  in these expenses include compensation expense  debt service on the loan and any adjustment required due to changes in the market value of 
table of contents the shares at time of allocation 
the reason for the increase in cost in compared to  was related to our higher stock price on common shares allocated 
dividends declared on common stock for and totaled per share  respectively 
the dividend payout ratio was for  compared to for the decrease in the dividend payout ratio was due to higher earnings while maintaining the same cash dividend per common share in regulatory capital we are subject to risk based capital standards under federal banking regulations 
these banking regulations relate a company s regulatory capital to the risk profile of its total assets and off balance sheet items  and provide the basis for evaluating capital adequacy 
under these standards  assets and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with applicable weights 
risk based capital standards require all banks to have tier capital of at least  and total capital including tier capital of at least  of risk adjusted assets 
ynb is also subject to leverage ratio requirements 
the leverage ratio measures tier capital to adjusted average assets 
the minimum ratio requirement is tier capital includes stockholders equity adjusted for intangibles and the unrealized gains losses in securities available for sale and trust preferred securities 
trust preferred securities are limited to of tier capital 
any trust preferred securities in excess of the tier limit are included in total capital 
total capital is comprised of all of the components of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the company s regulatory capital ratios at december   and december  risk based capital ratios tier total capital leverage ratio under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized financial institution must maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least 
due to our agreement with the occ  however  the bank is no longer considered well capitalized for certain regulatory purposes 
this capital category does not  however  constitute an accurate representation of the bank s general financial condition or prospects 
in addition  under the agreement  the bank has to achieve and maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least 
in november  to help meet the higher capital and leverage ratios established by the formal agreement  we completed a private equity placement to a select number of accredited investors  which included ynb directors of approximately million  substantially all of which was contributed to the bank 
we were in compliance with all required ratios at december  we believe the combination of controlled asset growth and solid financial performance in will allow us to continue to exceed all applicable minimum capital requirements 

table of contents earnings analysis for prior year compared to ynb earned net income of million or per diluted share in compared to million or per diluted share in this represents an increase of and  respectively 
the notable increase in net income was due to strong net interest income growth of million partially offset by a million increase in non interest expense  as well as higher income tax expense due to better financial performance 
net interest income net interest income totaled million in  an increase of million or from net interest income of million in there were two principal factors that contributed to the increase in net interest income in an increase in interest income of million resulting from a increase in interest and fees on loans  due to increased volumes for the comparative periods  was the primary driver in higher net interest income 
to a somewhat lesser extent  a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a increase in average interest bearing liabilities  also contributed to the net interest income improvement 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared with for the same period in ynb s financial success in was driven by the combination of a low interest rate environment  our strength as a commercial business lender and the successful execution of our retail strategy  which resulted in a lower cost of funds and a higher net interest margin 
average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion for  compared to billion in in addition  the yield on our earning assets increased basis points to 
as a result  in  interest income rose to million  compared to million for driven by commercial loans  loans averaged billion for  an increase of million or when compared with billion for interest and fees on loans increased million or despite a basis point decline on loan yields 
even though short term interest rates rose basis points in the second half of the booking of prime priced commercial loans at yield levels less than fixed rate loans had the effect of lowering the loan portfolio yield 
the loan portfolio yield increased throughout the last six months of as a significant portion of our floating rate commercial loan portfolio rose above their floors  which had been instituted over the last few years 
approximately of ynb s commercial loans have floating interest rates 
during the average prime rate increased to compared to in the higher yield on our securities portfolio also contributed to our net interest income and margin improvement 
securities purchased at levels close to par with modestly longer duration resulted in a higher securities yield 
average interest bearing liabilities rose million to billion  while overall funding costs declined basis points to during the higher volume of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in a modest increase in interest expense of  or  to million when compared to million in in  we experienced success in reducing and then managing our cost of funds as the result of the execution of our retail strategy 
to achieve that objective we focused on our relationship based banking philosophy  which attracted lower cost core deposits and changed the composition of our deposit base 
total interest expense on interest bearing deposits remained the same for compared to  as money market balances and interest bearing demand deposits increased million  or to million during the corresponding cost of these deposits declined basis points to 
average savings  money markets and interest bearing deposits represented of total average interest bearing deposits during compared to for higher cost average time deposits represented of our average deposit base during compared to during growth in average demand deposits of million or to million in positively impacted our net interest margin 
the average cost of borrowed funds increased seven basis points to due to higher costs associated with floating rate fhlb advances that repriced higher as interest rates gradually moved higher in the second half of 
table of contents conversely  the average cost of subordinated debentures declined basis points to from in principally due to a change in composition and cost from through the combination of factors discussed above resulted in a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to in from during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses totaled million for  an increase of  when compared to million for the modest increase is reflective of the strong commercial loan growth experienced in  partially offset by lower net charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses increased by million to million at december  compared to million at the end of non interest income non interest income  excluding net securities gains and the gain on sale of our operations building in  rose  or to million for when compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher service charge income partially offset by a reduction in income on bank owned life insurance due to a lower interest crediting rate  reflective of the lower interest rate environment that existed when the interest crediting rate was established 
service charges represented the largest single source of core non interest income in during  fee based services  which include automated teller machine related fees  second check  wire transfer and check fees increased  to million in from million in other non interest income  which included mortgage servicing  and safe deposit box rentals  totaled  in compared to  in included in our results was the sale of our former operations building to a board member  which resulted in a  gain 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million or  compared to million in the largest increases in non interest expense in were in salaries and employee benefits  and directors and committee fees 
expenses associated with our sox compliance  including audit and consulting fees  contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
salaries and employee benefits increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense in was primarily due to increased salary expense as the result of additional lending staff and from growth 
net occupancy expense increased  or to million in from million in principally due to new branches opened as part of our retail strategy and facilities related expenses  such as repairs and maintenance 
outside services and processing expenses increased  or to million in from  in we estimate that the impact to pre tax earnings of implementing sox as a result of additional expenses was approximately  to  or to cents on diluted earnings per share in excluding net securities gains and the sale of our former operations building in  our efficiency ratio was and for and  respectively 
the improvement in this ratio is principally due to the increased level of net interest income in income taxes the provision for federal and state income taxes was million in compared to million in for  the effective tax rate was compared to for the increases in tax expense and our effective tax rates were principally due to higher taxable income
