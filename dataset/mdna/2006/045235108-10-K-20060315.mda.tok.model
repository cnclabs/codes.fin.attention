item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we derive our revenue primarily from sales of bis monitors  our original equipment manufacturer products including bis module kits and bisx and related accessories  which we collectively refer to as equipment  and sales of bis sensors 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from strategic alliances 
for management purposes  we segregate our revenue by sales within region and sales by product group as shown in the following table in thousands domestic revenue percent of total revenue international revenue percent of total revenue total revenue bis sensor revenue percent of total revenue equipment revenue percent of total revenue strategic alliance revenue percent of total revenue total revenue at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we follow a system of fiscal quarters as opposed to calendar quarters 
under this system  the first three quarters of each fiscal year end on the saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter and the last quarter of the fiscal year always ends on december we believe our ability to grow our revenue is directly related to our ability to sell our equipment to healthcare organizations and influence our customers after they purchase our equipment to continue to purchase and use our bis sensors 
we believe the increase in our installed base of equipment resulting from the sale of bis monitors and the sale of original equipment manufacturers equipment incorporating our bis module kit or bisx system has been the primary reason for the growth in revenue from the sale of bis sensors 
in order to successfully grow our revenue  we need to continue to focus on both selling our equipment and improving our per monitor and per original equipment manufacturer product sensor utilization rate 
to achieve this growth  we continue to implement new sales and marketing programs 
we expect that as we grow our business  revenue from the sale of bis sensors will continue to contribute an increasing percentage of product revenue 
additionally  we believe that  over time  revenue from the sale of bis module kits and our bisx system will increase as a percentage of total equipment revenue as healthcare organizations purchase our technology as part of an integrated solution offered by our original equipment manufacturers 
in order to sustain profitability  we believe that we need to continue to maintain our gross profit margin and control the growth of our operating expenses 
to maintain our gross profit margin we believe we must continue to focus on maintaining our average unit sales prices of our bis sensors  increasing revenue from the sale of bis sensors as a percentage of total revenue  as bis sensors have a higher gross profit margin than equipment  and continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing our products 
for those healthcare organizations desiring to acquire our bis monitors directly from us  we offer two options 
our customers have the option either to purchase bis monitors outright or to acquire bis monitors pursuant to a sales type lease agreement whereby the customer contractually commits to purchase a minimum 
table of contents number of bis sensors per bis monitor per year 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
we also grant these customers an option to purchase the bis monitors at the end of the term of the agreement  which is typically three to five years 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
sales type leases accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
under certain limited circumstances  we also offer customers the opportunity to use the bis monitors under our equipment placement program  which we refer to as the ep program 
under the ep program  the customer is granted the right to use the bis monitors for a mutually agreed upon period of time 
during this period  the customer purchases bis sensors at a price that includes a premium above the list price of the bis sensors to cover the rental of the equipment  but without any minimum purchase commitments 
at the end of the agreed upon period  the customer has the option of purchasing the bis monitors  continuing to use them under the ep program or returning them to us 
we have subsidiaries in the netherlands and the united kingdom to facilitate the sale of our products into the international market 
we are continuing to develop our international sales and distribution program through our own sales and marketing personnel and a combination of distributors and marketing partners  including companies with which we have entered into original equipment manufacturer relationships 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with nihon kohden corporation to distribute bis monitors in japan 
nihon kohden has received approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare for marketing in japan our a eeg monitor with bis  our a bis monitor  our bis module and  most recently in  our bis xp system 
in january  the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare granted reimbursement approval for use of our bis monitors 
with this approval  healthcare providers in japan are eligible to receive partial reimbursement of  yen each time bis monitoring is used 
sales to nihon kohden represented approximately  and  respectively  of international revenue in  and  respectively 
various factors may adversely affect our quarterly operating results through the first fiscal quarter of and beyond 
these factors include the impact of the shift in our placements from bis monitors to original equipment manufacturer products  which may lead to a reduction in gross margin on equipment  the continued challenges of the worldwide economy and recent industry pronouncements on anesthesia awareness  including the sentinel event alert issued by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and the practice advisory on interoperative awareness which was approved by the american society of anesthesiologists house of delegates in october the advisory recommends that the decision to use brain monitoring technology should be made by individual practitioners on a case by case basis 
in addition  in japan  nihon kohden recently received approval of the bis xp system and we may not recognize the potential benefits of this approval for some time  if at all 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we do not believe there is a 
table of contents significant likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition we sell our bis monitors primarily through a combination of a direct sales force and distributors 
our original equipment manufacturer products are sold to original equipment manufacturers who in turn sell them to the end user 
bis sensors are sold through a combination of a direct sales force  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
direct product sales are structured as sales  sales type lease arrangements or sales under our ep program 
we recognize revenue when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we also recognize revenue from prepaid license and royalty fees 
this revenue is deferred until product shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of the agreement and license and royalty fees are earned in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements 
in august  we recorded approximately  of deferred revenue related to an oem product development and distribution agreement with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the oem product development and distribution agreement 
the deferred revenue is being recognized ratably over the term of the oem product development and distribution agreement  as amended  which represents our best estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation to provide boston scientific corporation exclusive distribution rights to newly developed technology 
we amended the oem product development and distribution agreement in january and extended the estimate of our period of significant continuing obligation by two years 
among other things  this amendment extends from december  to december  boston scientific corporation s right to exercise its option to distribute certain products developed by us for monitoring patients under sedation in a range of medical specialities and also extends from december  to december  the term during which boston scientific s corporation may serve as distributor of these products upon exercise of such option 
as a result  we reduced the revenue that we recognized by approximately  in we will recognize approximately  of revenue on an annual basis over the remaining term of the oem product development and distribution agreement 
if our estimate of the period of significant continuing obligation is revised  this may have an impact on our revenue recognition of the deferred revenue related to this agreement with boston scientific corporation 
in may  we recorded  of deferred revenue pursuant to a product development and distribution agreement that we entered into with boston scientific corporation  which we refer to as the product development and distribution agreement 
pursuant to this agreement  boston scientific corporation will provide to us  to fund the development of brain monitoring technology designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment for depression and alzheimer s disease 
under the terms of this agreement  we are entitled to receive development payments in five annual installments of  beginning on may  revenue is recognized on all allowable product development activities as the services are performed and costs are incurred  and we are obligated to spend all of the funding in the research areas related to diagnosing and treating depression and alzheimer s disease 
the amount of revenue recognized under this agreement will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the level of allowable research and development expenses in any given quarter 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for leases  for our sales type lease agreements 
under our sales type leases  customers purchase bis sensors and the bis monitor for the purchase price of the bis sensors plus an additional charge per bis sensor to pay for the purchase price of the bis monitor and related financing costs over the term of the agreement 
the minimum lease payment  consisting of the additional charge per bis sensor  less the unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  is recorded as the net investment in sales type leases 
we recognize equipment revenue under sales type lease agreements either at shipment or delivery in accordance 
table of contents with the agreed upon contract terms with interest income recognized over the life of the sales type lease 
the cost of the bis monitor acquired by the customer is recorded as costs of revenue in the same period 
we review and assess the net realizability of our investment in sales type leases at each reporting period 
this review includes determining  on a customer specific basis  if a customer is significantly underperforming relative to the customer s cumulative level of committed bis sensor purchases as required by the sales type lease agreement 
if a customer is underperforming  we record an allowance for lease payments as a charge to revenue to reflect the lower estimate of the net realizable investment in sales type lease balance 
we recognize revenue either at shipment or delivery in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors and original equipment manufacturers in accordance with sab no 
sales to distributors and original equipment manufacturers include a clause in the contracts that indicates that customer acceptance is limited to confirmation that our products function in accordance with our applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
formal acceptance by the distributor or original equipment manufacturer is not necessary to recognize revenue provided that we objectively demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
each product is tested prior to shipment to ensure that it meets the applicable product specifications in effect at the time of delivery 
additionally  we have historically had a minimal number of defective products shipped to distributors and original equipment manufacturers  and any defective products are subject to repair or replacement under warranty as distributors and original equipment manufacturers do not have a right of return 
accounts receivable we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by making estimates and judgments based on our historical collections experience  current trends  historical write offs of our receivables  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
we also review the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  our credit loss rates in the future may not be consistent with our historical experience 
to the extent we experience a deterioration in our historical collections experience or increased credit losses  bad debt expense would likely increase in future periods 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on production history and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
the medical device industry in which we market our products is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we would need to change our estimate of the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
if revisions are deemed necessary  we would recognize the adjustments in the form of a charge to costs of revenue at the time of the determination 
therefore  although we continually update our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated declines in demand or technological developments  such as the introduction of new products by our competitors  could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
warranty equipment that we sell generally is covered by a warranty period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on our historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  to the extent we experience an increased number of warranty claims or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty expenses will increase  and we may experience decreased gross profit margin and cash flow

 the proceeds from these sales were classified as debt 
in september  we paid off the remaining debt obligation of approximately  to americorp financial  inc we had capital expenditures of approximately million for the year ended december   which related primarily to the purchase of components for two additional automated sensor manufacturing lines in order to meet our long term projections for customer demand 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures in will increase compared with the level of capital expenditures in as we expect to purchase additional components for these sensor manufacturing lines 
in february  we entered into an agreement with the supplier of our electronic memory device used in the xp family of our disposable sensors to purchase a sufficient quantity of these electronic memory devices to maintain our inventory levels 
this purchase totaled approximately million and was completed in september we have summarized below our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than one to three three to five after five contractual obligations total one year years years years operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
income taxes we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  and tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
these tax attributes began expiring in and will continue to expire through if not utilized 
additionally  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined under 
table of contents sections and in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the company s value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
we have substantial net operating loss carryforwards that have generated significant deferred tax assets 
although we were profitable for the year ended december   we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over an appropriate time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized

the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted with certain exceptions and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of sfas no 
r as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
since we currently account for stock options and restricted stock awards granted to employees and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense generally is recognized 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on periods after adoption cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we adopted sfas no 
r in and selected the modified prospective method of application 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting for  and reporting of changes  in accounting principles 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is not practical to do so 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a any impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  high grade corporate bonds and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made with an average maturity of months or less and a maximum maturity of months 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investment in sales type leases and line of credit agreements are also subject to market risk 
the interest rates implicit in our sales type leases are fixed and not subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on our line of credit agreements are variable and subject to interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk related to the lines of credit is mitigated primarily by the fact that the lines of credit  when drawn on  are generally outstanding for short periods of time in order to fund short term cash requirements 
foreign currency exposure most of our revenue  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars 
the expenses and capital spending of our two international subsidiaries are transacted in the respective country s local currency and subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our foreign currency transactions are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in current period income or loss as incurred 
currently  all material transactions are denominated in us dollars  and we have not entered into any material transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies
