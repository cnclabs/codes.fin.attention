item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in fiscal year  we changed our fiscal week to end on tuesday rather than saturday  with our fiscal year ending on the last tuesday in december 
this change allowed us to better serve customers by shifting the weekly closing activities to a less busy day of the week 
as a result  our fiscal year ended on december  instead of december  and  therefore  consisted of fifty two and a half weeks rather than the fifty three week year that would have resulted without the calendar change 
the additional days in fiscal year compared to fiscal year occurred in the first quarter  resulting in the first quarter being sixteen and a half weeks instead of sixteen weeks 
as a result of this calendar change  the next fifty three week year will occur in fiscal year our fiscal year ended on the last saturday in december for and prior fiscal years and consisted of four week periods  with the first  second  and third quarters ending weeks  weeks  and weeks  respectively  into the fiscal year

actual experience related to number of claims and cost per claim could be more or less favorable than estimated resulting in expense reduction or increase

off balance sheet arrangement we are the prime tenant for operating leases of franchisee locations and a guarantor for operating leases of locations of the former au bon pain division  or our franchisees 
these leases have terms expiring on various dates from january to december and have a potential amount of future rental payments of approximately million 
the obligation from these leases will continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
as the guarantees were initiated prior to december   we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees pursuant to the provisions of fasb interpretation number fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
also  we have not had to make any payments related to the leases 
au bon pain or the respective franchisees continue to have primary liability for these operating leases 
potential future commitments consist of potential commitments as of december  in thousands total in after subleases and lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
at december   we had two swap agreements  which fixed the price of our projected butter purchases in these agreements require us to purchase million pounds of butter at per pound 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivatives 
in november  we signed an agreement with dawn food products  inc dawn to provide sweet goods for the period the agreement with dawn is structured as a cost plus agreement 
beginning in fiscal  we executed confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements agreements with certain employees 
these agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by us as specified in the agreement 
in accordance with sfas  we have not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  we will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these agreements was approximately million 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening or acquisition of additional bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities and maintenance and remodel expenditures  have and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many 
table of contents factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the exercise of employee stock options  supplemented  where necessary  by borrowings on our revolver  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation in the past  we have been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases  including  among other things  fuel  butter  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on our net income have not been materially adverse 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although we have and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  we have not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins
