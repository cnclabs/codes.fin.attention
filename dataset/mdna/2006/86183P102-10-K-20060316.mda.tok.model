item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we are an independent designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the automotive  medium and heavy duty truck  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for our results were affected by operating losses at certain of our operations involved in our manufacturing restructuring initiatives  as well as a number of challenging industry wide issues  including intense competition  product price reductions  higher commodity costs  customer bankruptcies  and lower north american light vehicle production levels 
we continuously work to address these challenges by implementing a broad range of initiatives aimed to improve operating performance 
one of the main focuses during was our restructuring program  which is aimed at reducing our overall manufacturing square footage and improving our cost structure accordingly 
in addition to our restructuring initiatives  we have implemented lean manufacturing principles  consolidated our purchasing activities  and we are continually evaluating the opportunity to manufacture products in low cost locations 
operating inefficiencies related to our restructuring efforts  primarily due to retention issues  also negatively affected our results 
these restructuring initiatives include the rationalization of certain manufacturing facilities in the high cost regions of europe and north america 
as a result of the rationalization  many employees opted not to move with the business causing significant turnover and increased hiring  training and expedited freight charges 
we recently began a transition of additional production from the united states to mexico by announcing the closing of a wire harness plant in the united states 
the production lines are planned to transition to mexico over the next year 
in connection with our overall restructuring plan  we recorded charges of million for the fiscal year we expect the total cost of our restructuring efforts for and to approximate million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
these challenges were offset by the favorable operating results of our pst joint venture in brazil  which added million to our equity in earnings of investees in significant factors inherent to our markets that could affect our results for include our ability to successfully execute our planned restructuring program  mitigate commodity price increases and customer demanded price reductions  and implement planned productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
our results for also depend on conditions in the automotive and commercial vehicle industries  which are generally dependent on domestic and global economies 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organization structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments vehicle management power distribution and control devices 
the vehicle management power distribution reportable segment includes results of operations from our operations that primarily design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution 
the control devices reportable segment includes results of operations from our operations that primarily design and manufacture electronic and electromechanical switches  control actuation devices and sensors 
beginning in  we changed from a calendar year end to a week fiscal year end 
our fiscal quarters are now comprised of week periods and once every seven years  starting in  the fourth quarter will be weeks in length 
the third quarter of and ended on october and september  respectively

net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease vehicle management power distribution control devices total net sales the increase in net sales for our vehicle management power distribution reportable segment was primarily due to increased north american commercial vehicle production  mitigated by product price reductions and a european product phase out 
the decrease in net sales for our control devices reportable segment during the fiscal year was primarily attributable to product price reductions and reduced north american light vehicle production for our customers 
net sales by geographic location for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table 
for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other total net sales north american sales accounted for of total net sales in compared with in net sales outside north america accounted for of total net sales in compared to in the decrease in sales outside north america was primarily attributed to lower light vehicle volume and a product phase out

the decline in north american sales is attributable to reduced light vehicle volumes and price reductions 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased to from for this increase as a percentage of sales was predominately due to operational inefficiencies resulting from the execution of our restructuring efforts  price reductions and reduced north american light vehicle volume 
going forward  we believe our management efforts will offset operational inefficiencies  however  we expect that pricing and volume challenges will continue to affect our gross margin through selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased by million to million from in included in sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended december  and were product development expenses of million and million  respectively

income loss before income taxes 
income loss before income taxes  which is the primary profitability measure used by our chief executive officer  is summarized in the following table by reportable segment for the years ended december  and for the fiscal years ended december  increase decrease vehicle management power distribution control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense income loss before income taxes income before income taxes for the year ended december  increased by million at the vehicle management power distribution reportable segment  primarily as the result of increased commercial vehicle production  offset by higher commodity costs and price reductions 
this increase also includes a benefit due to favorable currency exchange rates 
the loss before income taxes recognized at our control devices reportable segment was due to the goodwill impairment loss of million recorded in the fourth quarter of after we performed its 
table of contents annual goodwill impairment analysis 
the main factors that contributed to the goodwill impairment charge included an organizational realignment that was completed during the fourth quarter of as the result of a change in executive leadership and a realization that the anticipated growth of one of our business units included in the control devices reportable segment no longer justified the carrying value of its goodwill 
excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge  income before income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million at the control devices reportable segment to million from million  primarily as the result of price reductions  higher commodity costs  and increased product development activities 
income before income taxes for the year ended december  for north america decreased by million to million from million for the corresponding period in income before income taxes for the year ended december  outside north america decreased by million to million from million for the corresponding period of the decrease in our worldwide profitability was primarily due to the non cash  goodwill impairment charge recognized in the loss before income taxes that we reported was also due to the decrease in passenger car and light truck production as well as price reductions  higher commodity costs  and increased product development activities  offset by increased commercial vehicle production and favorable currency exchange rates 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a provision benefit for income taxes of million  or of the pre tax loss  and million  or of pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for decreased primarily due to the tax benefit recognized on the loss 
the rate decrease was marginally impacted by a reduction in state taxes  which was offset by a reduction in credits and the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to a decrease in our profitability  largely attributable to operating inefficiencies related to our restructuring efforts  the decrease in passenger car and light truck production  product price reductions  customer bankruptcies and increased product development activities 
this decrease was partially offset by decreases in working capital requirements 
net cash used by investing activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used by investing activities of million was attributable to an increase in capital spending for our restructuring initiatives  high temperature sensors  speed sensors and customer actuated switches  offset by proceeds received from a sale of fixed assets in the united kingdom in net cash used by financing activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to capital lease payments and deferred debt issuance costs related to the company s credit facility amendments 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million to reduce exposure related to our krona and pound denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was approximately million 
the company s foreign currency option contracts have expired as of december  our credit facilities contain various covenants that require  among other things  the maintenance of certain specified ratios of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage 
restrictions also include limits on capital expenditures  operating leases and dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  on march   the company amended its credit agreement dated may  the amendment modifies certain financial covenant requirements  changes 
table of contents certain reporting requirements  sets borrowing levels based on certain asset levels and prohibits the company from repurchasing  repaying or redeeming any of the company s outstanding subordinated notes unless certain covenant levels are met 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  the company s million senior notes are redeemable in may at 
less than after contractual obligations total year years year years long term debt operating leases employee benefit plans total contractual obligations future capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with recent levels and future organic growth is expected to be funded through cash flows from operations 
management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
as outlined in note to our financial statements  the company is a party to a million revolving credit facility 
due to certain financial covenants  as of december   the company was restricted to access no more than million of the million credit facility 
on march   the company amended the credit agreement  which  among other things  gave the company substantially all of its borrowing capacity on the million credit facility 
we also have million in available cash  and believe that we will have access to the debt and equity markets should the need arise 
inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent increases in certain commodity prices  we believe that a continuation of such price increases would significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by the economic conditions of certain countries 
based on the current economic conditions in these countries  we believe we are not significantly exposed to adverse economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies  those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns and historical trends in sales returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the 
table of contents entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
in order to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet our financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimated that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill on january  in lieu of amortization  this standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment as of the date of adoption  at least annually thereafter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
effective april   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
because the company had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions required by sfas  and due to the fact that all unvested awards at the time of adoption were being recognized under a fair value approach  the adoption of sfas r did not affect our operating income  income before income taxes  net income  cash flow from operating activities  cash flow from financing activities  or basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for assumptions used to determine fair value 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations  as well as net operating loss  tax credit and other carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain 
table of contents non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  and our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  as an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement becomes effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of the act that was signed into law in october the act could affect how companies report their deferred income tax balances 
the first fsp is fsp sfas sfas  the second is fsp sfas sfas 
in sfas  the fasb concluded that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing companies from the act should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
the company has reviewed sfas the company has not issued financial statements that treat the domestic manufacturing deduction as a rate reduction 
therefore  sfas did not affect the company s financial statements for the company now treats the domestic manufacturing deduction as a special deduction in its financial statements issued for forward 
sfas gives companies additional time to evaluate the effects of the act on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas  accounting for income taxes 
however  companies must provide certain disclosures if they choose to utilize the additional time granted by the fasb 
the company did not repatriate foreign earnings during or it is management s intent not to repatriate foreign earnings during and beyond 
therefore  no disclosure is required 
these fsps  which were effective immediately  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements in order to change the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
the statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement becomes effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements portions of this report contain forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company  our directors or officers with respect to  among other things  our i future product and facility expansion  ii acquisition strategy  iii investments and new product development  and iv growth opportunities related to awarded business 
forward looking 
table of contents statements may be identified by the words will  may  designed to  believes  plans  expects  continue  and similar words and expressions 
the forward looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include  among other factors the loss or bankruptcy of a major customer  the costs and timing of facility closures  business realignment  or similar actions  a significant change in automotive  medium and heavy duty or agricultural and off highway vehicle production  our ability to achieve cost reductions that offset or exceed customer mandated selling price reductions  a significant change in general economic conditions in any of the various countries in which we operate  labor disruptions at our facilities or at any of our significant customers or suppliers  the ability of our suppliers to supply us with parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis  the amount of debt and the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facility  customer acceptance of new products  capital availability or costs  including changes in interest rates or market perceptions  the successful integration of any acquired businesses  the occurrence or non occurrence of circumstances beyond our control  and those items described in part i  item ia 
risk factors item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
at december   however  all of our debt was fixed rate debt 
in order to manage the interest rate risk associated with the company s previous debt portfolio  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which were terminated on may  at this time  we do not intend to use financial instruments to manage this risk 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and the recent increases in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  steel  and resins 
we manage this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
at this time  we do not intend to use financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
the recent increases in certain commodity costs have negatively affected our operating results  and a continuation of such price increases could significantly affect our profitability 
going forward  we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of the financial impact of these increased costs 
however  no assurances can be given that the magnitude or duration of these increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our risks related to foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate  we are monitoring this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million to reduce exposure related to our krona and pound denominated intercompany loans 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was approximately million 
the company s foreign currency option contracts have expired as of december  we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
furthermore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted exchange rates would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
