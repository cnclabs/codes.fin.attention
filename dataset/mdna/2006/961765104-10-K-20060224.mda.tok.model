overview we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our two subsidiaries  westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate pension funds  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  mutual funds and clients of westwood trust 
westwood trust provides to institutions and high net worth individuals trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management  and at december  westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion 
we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc  when measured over multi year periods  our principal asset classes have consistently ranked above the median in performance within their peer groups 
one of the priorities on which we have focused since our spin off in is building a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a potentially much larger business 
we have also developed products that we believe will be desirable within our target institutional marketplace 
the cost of developing new products and the organization as a whole has resulted in us incurring expenses that  in some cases  do not currently have material offsetting revenue 
now that we believe the foundation and the products are in place we are taking these new products to the institutional marketplace and are hopeful that institutional investors will recognize the value in these products and generate new revenue streams for us 
we began marketing our smidcap value product to institutional investment consultants in late  as a result of this targeted marketing effort we gained a number of meaningful smidcap value clients in revenues we derive our revenues from investment advisory fees  trust fees  and other revenues 
our advisory fees are generated by westwood management  which manages its clients accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
advisory fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets under management  and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
most of westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on the assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter 
however  some fees are paid quarterly in arrears or are based on daily or monthly average assets under management for the stated period 
westwood management recognizes revenues as services are rendered 
our trust fees are generated by westwood trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements 
trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management  which in turn is influenced by the complexity of the operations of the trust and the services provided 
westwood trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis 
similar to advisory fees generated by westwood management  most trust fees are paid quarterly in advance and are recognized as services are rendered 
our other revenues generally consist of interest income  investment income and consulting fees 
we invest most of our cash in money market funds  although we do invest smaller amounts in bonds and equity instruments 
the most significant component of our other revenues is investment income and to a lesser extent  consulting fees paid to us by gabelli advisers  inc

the effective tax rate was in compared to in liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash requirements with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   we had no long term debt 
the changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of non cash items and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital  especially accounts receivable and accounts payable  are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities  principally our investment advisory business  was million 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and million during and  respectively 
at december  and  we had working capital of million and million  respectively

we had cash and investments of million at december   compared to million at december  as required by the texas finance code  westwood trust maintains minimum restricted capital of million  which is included in investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we had no liabilities for borrowed money at december  or december   and our accounts payable were paid in the ordinary course of business for each of the periods then ended 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to raise needed capital on attractive terms  if at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s known contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due in contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years non cancelable operating leases accounting developments in december  the fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
r  requiring public companies to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in their financial statements 
the standard requires the company to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
adoption of the revised statement is required for the company s first quarter beginning january  the company has applied the fair value provisions of the original sfas no 
for all options and restricted shares it has issued 
had the company implemented the provisions of sfas r for the years ended december   and  diluted earnings per share would have been   and  respectively 
the company has completed it s analysis of the impact that sfas no 
r will have on it s financial statements upon implementation on january  since the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred instead of estimating the effect of forfeitures  the company will record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle totaling approximately  net of tax  in order to reverse compensation expense recorded for unvested securities as of december  that is in excess of what the company currently estimates will vest 
also in accordance with sfas r  the company will eliminate its unamortized stock compensation balance against additional paid in capital 
starting on january   the company will record compensation expense in accordance with the forfeiture estimate provisions of sfas r  however  if actual forfeitures of awards differ from the 
table of contents calculation of estimated forfeitures for those awards  the company will be required to recognize the difference in income as an adjustment to employee compensation and benefits 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition investment advisory and trust fees are recognized in the period the services are provided 
these fees are determined in accordance with contracts between our subsidiaries and their clients and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
accounting for investments we record our investments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we have designated our investments other than money market holdings as trading securities  which are recorded at market value with the related unrealized gains and losses reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
our trading securities  primarily us government and government agency obligations as well as mutual fund and common trust fund shares  are valued based upon quoted market prices and  with respect to funds  the net asset value of the shares held as reported by the fund 
we have designated our investments in money market accounts as available for sale 
the market values of our money market holdings generally do not fluctuate 
dividends and interest on all of our investments are accrued as earned 
goodwill during the third quarters of  and  the company completed its annual impairment assessment as required by sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment losses were required 
the company performs its annual impairment assessment as of july stock options effective january   we elected to begin expensing the cost associated with stock options granted subsequent to january  to employees as well as non employee directors under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation fair value model 
we value stock options issued based upon the black scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the periods in which the options vest 
implementation of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and expected life of the options 
we utilized assumptions that we believed to be most appropriate at the time of the valuation 
had we used different assumptions in the pricing model the expense recognized for stock options may have been different than the expense recognized in our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize various financial instruments  which entail certain inherent market risks 
we do not currently participate in any hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any derivative financial instruments 
the following information describes the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risks 
interest rates and securities markets our cash equivalents and other investment instruments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
these instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
we do not expect our interest income to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
the value of our assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in securities markets 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory and trust fees based on the value of assets under management  our revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates or a decline in the prices of securities generally
