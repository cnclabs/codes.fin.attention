item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains statements regarding operating trends and our beliefs and expectations regarding our future financial performance and future financial condition which are referred to as forward looking statements 
the consequences of those operating trends on our business and the realization of our expected future financial results  which are discussed in those statements  are subject to the uncertainties and risks that are described above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
due to those uncertainties and risks  the duration and effects of those operating trends on our business and our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from those that are currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on those forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
we consider the accounting policy that we follow in determining the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses we consider to be a critical accounting policy 
allowance for loan losses 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
accordingly  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic market conditions and other economic indicators  to determine the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if  however  unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  actual loan losses could be greater than those predicted by those loss factors and our current assessments of current conditions and economic trends 
in such an event  it would be necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of our loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income  in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
discontinued business in june  we decided to exit the wholesale mortgage lending business in order to concentrate our capital and management resources on expanding our commercial banking business 
this decision was based on a number of factors  which included the steady growth achieved in  and the opportunities to further expand  our commercial lending business  
table of contents increases in the costs of operations of the wholesale mortgage banking business and  therefore  the prospect that  by exiting that business  we could be able to improve the efficiency of our operations  an anticipated increase in the variability of the period to period operating results of the wholesale mortgage lending business  which would make it more difficult to achieve consistency and predictability in our results of operations  and the amount of capital that would be required to grow and improve the profitability of the wholesale mortgage lending business  particularly in the face of the changing interest rate and market environment 
the exit of the wholesale mortgage loan operations was completed in the in the fourth quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  the operating results of the wholesale mortgage lending business have been classified as discontinued operations and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
additionally  as a result of exit from our wholesale mortgage lending business  our commercial banking business  together with our retail securities brokerage business that is conducted by pmb securities corp 
constitute our continuing operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on those continuing operations 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information regarding the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred  our net interest income  noninterest income  noninterest expense  and our net income and net income per share for the years ended december   and year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income net income per share diluted income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares net of taxes the increase in income from continuing operations in as compared to was primarily attributable to a combination of factors  the most important of which were improvement in net interest income and net interest margin 
net interest income increased by million  or  in fiscal  primarily as a result of a i million  or  increase in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal as compared to fiscal  and ii higher yields realized on our interest 
table of contents earning assets due primarily to the increases in interest rates implemented by the federal reserve board  that commenced in mid the increase in loan volume in and those interest rates increases were also the principal contributors to an improvement in our interest margin to in fiscal from in fiscal management of noninterest expense growth and improvements in efficiency ratio 
the increase in net interest income in was achieved without a corresponding increase in noninterest expense which  by comparison grew by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite the fact that we significantly expanded our new long beach  california financial center and opened our new ontario  california financial center in as a result  by containing the growth of our noninterest expense  we were able to improve our efficiency ratio operating expenses as a percentage to total revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in net income in was primarily attributable to the increase in net interest income and the slowing of the growth of our noninterest expense  which more than offset a loss from discontinued operations of  that was attributable to the discontinuance in of our wholesale mortgage lending business  including severance and other costs incurred in winding down that business 
set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data from continuing operations for the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans  and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to i an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal over fiscal and ii an increase in yields on interest earning assets to in from in  due primarily to the effects of the interest rate increases that were implemented by the 
table of contents federal reserve board during the period from mid to the end of we funded the increase in loan volume by increasing our deposit volume and borrowings  which included advances from the federal home loan bank and investment repurchase agreements 
as a result of the increase in loan volume  average outstanding loans represented of average earning assets in as compared to in the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily i a million increase in the average volume of our borrowings  which consisted primarily of borrowings from the federal home loan bank and million principal amount of year junior subordinated debentures that we sold during the fourth quarter of  and ii an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to in from in our net interest margin for fiscal improved to from in fiscal that improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in interest income  partially offset by the increase in interest expense 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or  increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans as compared to the average volume of loans outstanding in fiscal we funded that increase in loan volume by increasing our deposit volume and by using funds that had been invested in lower yielding short term investments and securities available for sale to fund higher yielding loans 
as a result  average outstanding loans represented of average earning assets in as compared to in and the yield on interest earning assets increased to from in the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily to an million increase in the average volume of borrowings  including million principal amount of year junior subordinated debentures that we sold during the fourth quarter of  which was partially offset by a basis point decline in rates paid on certificates of deposit during our net interest margin for fiscal improved to from in fiscal that improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in interest income and  to a lesser extent  to a decline in the average rate of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities to in from  in fiscal

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   to and to and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in volumes of or changes in rates earned on interest earning assets and changes in the volumes of and rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

the above table indicates that the increases of million and million in our net interest income in the fiscal and  respectively  in each case as compared to immediately preceding fiscal year  were the result of increases of million and million  respectively  in volume variance and of million and million  respectively  in interest rate variance 
the increases in the volume variance reflect the increases in average earning assets of million and million  respectively  and increases in average interest bearing liabilities of million and million  respectively  in fiscal and  in each case  as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year 
the increases in the rate variance reflect an basis points increase  partially offset by a basis points increase in interest rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities in  and an increase of basis points in interest rates earned on average earning assets  coupled with a basis points decrease in interest rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities  in  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance the allowance for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what management believes is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  or write down is charged against the allowance 
the amount of the allowance is increased periodically i to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of income referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the allowance for loan losses and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise have to be made to replenish or increase the allowance 

table of contents although we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and historical loss experience to evaluate and determine the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and  thereby  the amount of the provisions required to be made for potential loan losses  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
the duration and effects of current economic trends are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and changes that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  it could become necessary to incur additional charges to increase the allowance  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the california department of financial institutions  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income 
the following table sets forth the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  and year ended december  dollars in thousands total gross loans outstanding at end of period average total loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of period loans charged off recoveries provision for loan losses charges to operating expense allowance for loan losses at end of period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans at end of period net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end of period net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses net loans charged off to provision for loan losses includes net deferred loan costs and excludes loans held for sale 
during fiscal we increased the provision we made for loan losses to million  up from  in fiscal  primarily as a result the million increase in our loan volume in nonaccrual and impaired loans totaled million or of the allowance for loan losses at december   as compared to  or of the allowance for loan losses at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans during the year ended december  was due primarily to one loan  which has collateral to cover the outstanding loan balance 
see allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 

table of contents noninterest income noninterest income consists primarily of fees charged for services provided by the bank on deposit accounts and commissions earned on securities brokerage services 
the following table identifies the components of and the percentage changes in noninterest income in the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands service fees on deposits net gains on sales of securities available for sale n m n m brokerage commissions net gains on sale of other real estate owned n m n m other total noninterest income noninterest income decreased by  or  in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the fact that we realized an  gain on sale of securities available for sale and  net gain on sale of other real estate owned in fiscal year the resulting decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in commissions earned on securities brokerage services in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in  noninterest income increased by  or  as compared to  due primarily to the fact that noninterest income in year ended december  included an increase in brokerage commissions of  and the aforementioned  of gain from the sale of other real estate owned  whereas there were no sales of  and hence no gains from  other real estate owned in fiscal year noninterest expense the following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest expense and the amounts thereof from continuing operations  incurred in the years ended december   and  respectively 
year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy equipment and depreciation data processing professional fees other loan related customer expense stationery and supplies other operating expense total noninterest expense other operating expense primarily consists of telephone  advertising  promotional  business development  regulatory expenses  investor relations  insurance premiums  and correspondent bank fees 

table of contents as indicated above  total noninterest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  or  as compared to the corresponding period in that increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses associated with the opening  in september  of our seventh financial center  which is located in long beach  california  the opening in inland empire financial center  which is located in ontario  california and increased commercial lending activities in all of our financial centers 
the increase in noninterest expense in  over was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses associated with the opening  in september  of our seventh financial center  which is located in long beach  california  and increased commercial lending activities in all of our financial centers a measure of our ability to control noninterest expense in relation to the level of our net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expense to net revenue 
as a general rule  all other things being equal  a lower efficiency ratio indicates an ability to generate increased revenue without a commensurate increase in the staffing and equipment and third party services and  therefore  would indicate greater efficiencies in our operations 
however  a bank s efficiency ratio can be adversely affected by factors such as the opening of new banking offices  the revenues of which usually lag behind the expenses that a bank must incur to staff and open the new offices 
notwithstanding the increase in the dollar amount of our noninterest expense in the fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  we were able to improve our efficiency ratio from continuing operations to from in in  our efficiency ratio from continuing operations improved to from in  due primarily to the increases we generated in net interest income 
we anticipate that noninterest expense also will be higher in  as compared to  due primarily to the expansion of our banking franchise resulting from the growth of our inland empire financial center and the expansion of our lending staff at other financial centers 
financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of an increase in the volume of our outstanding loans that during we believe the increase in loan volume in was primarily attributable to i the expansion and maturing of our banking franchise during the past two years  ii marketing programs implemented in  and iii improvements in economic conditions  that led to increases in loan demand 
this increase in outstanding loans was funded primarily by increases in borrowings and  to a lesser extent  increases in deposits

investment policy and securities available for sale our investment policy is designed to provide for our liquidity needs and to generate a favorable return on investment without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 

table of contents our investment policy authorizes us to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  time deposits issued by federally insured depository institutions  municipal securities and in federal funds sold  provides that the weighted average maturities of us government obligations and federal agency securities cannot exceed years and municipal obligations cannot exceed years  provides that time deposits must be placed with federally insured financial institutions  cannot exceed  in any one institution and may not have a maturity exceeding months  and prohibits engaging in securities trading activities 
securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks or other similar factors are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss rather than included in or deducted from our earnings 
the following is a summary of the major components of securities available for sale and a comparison of the amortized cost  estimated fair values and the gross unrealized gains and losses attributable to those securities  as of december  and december  amortized cost gross unrealized gain gross unrealized loss estimated fair value dollars in thousands december  securities available for sale mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations total government and agencies securities municipal securities mutual fund total securities available for sale december  securities available for sale mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations total government and agencies securities mutual fund total securities available for sale at december   us government and federal agency securities  consisting principally of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with an aggregate fair market value of million were pledged to secure federal home loan bank borrowings  repurchase agreements  local agency deposits and treasury  tax and loan accounts 

table of contents the amortized cost and estimated fair value  at december   of securities available for sale are shown in the table below by contractual maturities and historical prepayments based on the prior three months of principal payments 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities and historical prepayments  particularly with respect to collateralized mortgage obligations  because changes in interest rates will affect the timing and the extent of prepayments by borrowers

we have determined that the declines in the fair values of these investments below their amortized costs  as set forth in the table above  are temporary based on the following i those declines are due to interest rate changes and not due to a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of those investment securities  and ii we have the ability to hold those securities until there is a recovery in their values 
loans held for sale as previously disclosed  our wholesale mortgage lending business  which originated these loans held for sale  was discontinued during and is classified in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations 
we completed the exit of that business during the fourth quarter of loans held for sale in the secondary market  which consist primarily of mortgage loans originated by our wholesale mortgage lending business  was zero at december   a decrease of million from december

real estate and residential mortgage loans are loans secured by trust deeds on real property  including commercial property and single family and multi family residences 
construction loans are interim loans to finance specific construction projects 
consumer loans include installment loans to consumers

the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  which represented approximately of the loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december   in each case exclusive of loans held for sale 
we carefully monitor changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  the financial condition of borrowers  the history of the loan portfolio  and we follow bank regulatory guidelines in determining the adequacy of the 
table of contents allowance 
we believe that the allowance at december  was adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
additionally  the allowance was established on the basis of assumptions and judgments regarding such matters as economic conditions and trends and the condition of borrowers  historical industry loan loss data and regulatory guidelines  and actual loan losses in the future could vary from the losses predicted on the basis of those assumptions  judgments and guidelines 
for example  if economic conditions were to deteriorate  or interest rates were to increase significantly  which would have the effect of increasing the risk that borrowers would encounter difficulties meeting their loan payment obligations  it could become necessary to increase the allowance by means of additional provisions for loan losses 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance to specific loan categories at the dates indicated below 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories as the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
december  allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans dollars in thousands real estate loans commercial loans construction loans consumer loans total allocations are identified by loan category and allocated according to charge off data pertaining to the banking industry 
substantially all of the loans in the loan portfolio are graded and incorporated in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans 
we also measure and establish reserves for loan impairments on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we exclude from our impairment calculations smaller  homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans and lines of credit 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or shortfalls are generally not considered impaired 
we cease accruing interest  and therefore classify as nonaccrual  any loan as to which principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  or if repayment in full of interest or principal is not expected 
at december  and  we had million and  respectively  of fully collateralized loans that were delinquent days or more and which were classified as nonaccrual and impaired loans 
we had no loans delinquent days or more as to principal that were still accruing interest or any restructured loans at december  or at december  at december   our average investment in impaired loans  on a year to date basis  was  the interest that we would have earned in the year ended december   had the impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include i payments on loans  and ii the sale or maturity of investments  iii growth in deposits  and iv borrowings 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on our customers existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   the source of which consisted primarily of net increases of million in deposits and million in net borrowings 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash flow of million was generated by our continuing operations 

table of contents cash flow used in investing activities 
in the year ended december   we used cash flow of million in investing activities  primarily to fund an increase of million in loans and million of purchases of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by million of proceeds from principal payments received on investment securities available for sale 
cash flow from discontinued operations 
our discontinued wholesale mortgage lending operations provided million in cash flow during the year ended december   principally from million of proceeds from the sales of loans held for sale  mostly offset by million used in the originations and purchases of loans held sale 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets at december  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits excluding loans held for sale was  compared to at december  even through our loans to deposits ratio was  we were able to maintain what we believe is adequate liquidity by means of federal home loan bank borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we were committed to fund certain loans inclusive of mortgages held for sale amounting to approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made is equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future

pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies have been permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
pursuant to those rulings  in  we formed subsidiary grantor trusts to sell and issue to institutional investors a total of million principal amount of floating junior trust preferred securities trust preferred securities 
we received the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities in exchange for our issuance to the grantor trusts  of a total million principal amount of our junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  the payment terms of which mirror those of the trust preferred securities 
the debentures also were pledged by the grantor trusts as security for their payment obligations under the trust preferred securities 

table of contents in october  we established another grantor trust that sold an additional million of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor and  in connection therewith  we sold and issued an additional million principal amount of junior subordinated floating rate debentures in exchange for the proceeds raised from the sale of those trust preferred securities 
the payments that we make of interest and principal on the debentures are used by the grantor trusts to make the payments that come due to the holders of the trust preferred securities pursuant to the terms of those securities

interest rate resets semi annually 
these debentures  which are redeemable at our option  without premium or penalty  beginning five years after their respective original issue dates  require quarterly or semi annual interest payments 
subject to certain conditions  we have the right  at our discretion  to defer those interest payments for up to five years 
however  we have no plans to exercise this deferrable right 
under the federal reserve board rulings  the borrowings evidenced by the debentures  which are subordinated to all of our other borrowings that are outstanding or which we may obtain in the future  are eligible subject to certain dollar limitations to qualify  and at december   a total of million principal amount of those debentures qualified  as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
the remaining  qualified as tier ii capital for regulatory purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk arises from the instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities  deposit liabilities  and short term borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
asset liability management the primary objective of asset liability management is to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  which can affect our net interest margins and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings 
we seek to achieve this objective by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintaining the maturities and the repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels in light of the prevailing interest rate environment 
generally  all other things being equal  i when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  net interest income will be positively impacted during a rising interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining interest rate environment  and ii when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  net interest income generally will be positively impacted during a declining interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising interest rate environment 
the table below sets forth information concerning our rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of maturity or repricing dates in accordance with their contractual terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table  which are discussed below 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions investment in unconsolidated trust subsidiaries securities available for sale federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative of rate sensitive assets in maturity period rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities n a cumulative ratio n a at december   as the above table indicates  our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative 
table of contents twelve month gap position 
this implies that our net interest margin would decrease in the short term if interest rates rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 
however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to interest rate changes  the mix of our interest earning assets loans versus other interest earning assets  such as securities and the mix of our interest bearing deposits between for example  lower interest core deposits and higher cost time certificates of deposit and our other interest bearing liabilities 
it is not uncommon rates on certain assets or liabilities typically lag behind changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  prepayments of loans and securities available for sale  and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit  could cause the interest sensitivities to vary 
additionally  the rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the table above assumes that we would make no changes in the mix of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in the interest rate environment  which is not consistent with our practices 
as a result  the relationship or gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  as shown in the above table  is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on our net interest income is likely to be different from that would be predicted on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the above table
