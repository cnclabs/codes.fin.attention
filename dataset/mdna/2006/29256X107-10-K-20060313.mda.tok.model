encysive pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  synthetic  small molecule compounds to address unmet medical needs 
our research and development programs are predominantly focused on the treatment and prevention of interrelated diseases of the vascular endothelium and exploit our expertise in the area of the intravascular inflammatory process  referred to as the inflammatory cascade  and vascular diseases 
we have successfully developed one fda approved drug  argatroban  for the treatment of hit that is marketed by gsk 
our lead drug candidate  thelin sitaxsentan sodium is an endothelin receptor antagonist that has successfully completed pivotal phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  or pah  and is under review by the fda  the emea  and regulatory authorities in australia and canada 
in addition  we have earlier stage clinical product candidates in development including tbc  a next generation endothelin receptor antagonist 
bimosiamose has been licensed to and is being developed by revotar biopharmaceuticals ag  or revotar  which was formerly a majority owned subsidiary 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize royalty revenue as a licensee sells products and we have received sufficient information to record a receivable 
our royalty revenue is based on net sales of product  that is  sales net of discounts  returns and allowances 
argatroban is licensed to glaxosmithkline  or gsk  which distributes and sells the product  and from which we receive a quarterly royalty payment 
at the time of each payment  gsk provides us with limited quarterly data related to the product s gross sales  sales returns  discounts and allowances 
while we are informed of the amount of product returns recorded each quarter  we do not have information necessary to identify the period or periods to which such returns correspond 
we believe that substantially all discounts and allowances pertain to current period sales 
we also believe that a portion of sales recorded in each period will ultimately be returned  and therefore estimate future returns and their impact on royalty revenues 
in the pharmaceutical industry  product returns are primarily influenced by remaining or expired shelf life  product withdrawals or recalls  significant price changes from competitors or the introduction of generic products or other new competition 
we are not aware of any pending product recalls or withdrawals  significant price fluctuations or generic or new competition 
accordingly  we have estimated only the impact of product dating on returns 
since we do not manufacture  sell or distribute argatroban  we do not have information related to levels of inventory in the distribution channels 
however  due to the cost of the drug and pressures on hospitals to minimize operating expenditures  we believe inventory levels are maintained at a minimally acceptable level 
inventory level is therefore not a part of the company s estimate process 
we have estimated remaining shelf life  which is an important reason for product returns  based upon the fact that argatroban has an expiration date of two years from manufacture 
common industry practice is that prescription drugs can be returned to the manufacturer at any time  however  product is normally returned when the remaining shelf life is reduced to six months or less 
our reserve is therefore based upon an estimate of the percentage of sales made in the preceding month period that may be returned in future periods 
initially  lacking any historical sales data for argatroban and based upon management s experience with other pharmaceutical products in the industry  management estimated that four percent of gross sales of argatroban would be returned during future periods 
based upon subsequent analysis of historical sales data  we believe that differences between estimated and actual future returns will not have a material effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents revenue from collaborative research and development activities is recognized as services are performed 
we defer the recognition of milestone payments related to contractual agreements that are still in the development stage 
such deferred revenues are amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
milestone payments received under contractual agreements which have completed the development stage are evaluated  and either recognized into income when earned  or amortized over a future period  depending upon whether we continue to have obligations under the terms of the arrangement 
license fees received under the terms of licensing agreements for our intellectual property are deferred and amortized into income over the estimated development period of the licensed item or items 
revenue from grants is recognized as earned under the terms of the related grant agreements  typically as expenses are incurred 
amounts received in advance of services being performed under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized as services are performed 
we periodically evaluate our estimates of remaining development periods  and adjust the recognition of remaining deferred revenues over the adjusted development period remaining 
at december   remaining deferred revenue was approximately million  of which we expect to recognize approximately million over the next months 
a future change in our estimate of development periods could accelerate or decelerate the timing of future recognition of deferred revenue 
stock options we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb in accounting for our stock option plans and apply fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations fas in reporting for our stock option plans 
apb utilizes the intrinsic value of stock options  defined as the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying share of common stock  on the measurement date which is generally the date of grant 
since the exercise price of employee stock options issued under our plans is set to match the market price of our common stock  there is generally no compensation expense recognized upon grant of employee stock options 
options granted to non employees  if any  are valued at the fair value of the option as defined by fas  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we record compensation expense for the fair value of options granted to non employees 
the pro forma effect of recognizing the fair value of stock option grants to employees on our consolidated results of operations is discussed in note o  stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
we are required to adopt fas r in the first quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note o to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts  for years through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under fas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock option awards 
for further discussion of fas r see note r to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
results of operations the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to make substantial expenditures during the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through a series of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt  and from funds received through our development and funding  collaborations  research agreements and partnerships 
see discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents in april  the stockholders of revotar  our former majority owned german subsidiary  agreed to restructure revotar s capitalization 
under the terms of the restructuring  revotar s stockholders other than the company contributed additional funds to revotar  and the company s ownership was reduced to approximately of the outstanding common stock of revotar 
revotar s other stockholders subsequently purchased the remaining shares of revotar common stock owned by the company for nominal consideration 
upon the funding of revotar by the other stockholders  the company licensed its worldwide rights to bimosiamose and certain follow on compounds to revotar for which it could receive substantial future royalty payments from revotar in the event that these compounds are subsequently approved and commercialized  or licensed to a third party 
further  the company agreed to cancel its outstanding loan  and accrued interest thereon  of approximately million 
the transaction became effective in may  upon contribution of the additional capital by revotar s other stockholders 
following the completion of the restructuring  the company s consolidated financial statements no longer include the results of revotar 
the company recorded a gain of approximately million upon its disposal of revotar  which is included in the amount reported under the caption gain loss from discontinued operations in the company s financial statements for year for additional information about revotar  see note to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
results for years and have been restated to reflect the classification of revotar as a discontinued operation during  with no change in reported net loss 
in april  we acquired the interest of our former partner in elp in a transaction also referred to as the acquisition 
for more information about the acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the million purchase price  million was paid at closing  and the remaining million was subject to the terms of a note to icos which was repaid in march deferred revenue of million  arising from previous payments received by us from elp for a license fee and milestones  was recognized as an offset to the purchase price  resulting in a charge for the purchase of in process research and development of million in year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased million  to million from million in year the increase is primarily due to higher royalties earned on higher sales of argatroban by gsk in year royalties increased to million  from million in license fees  milestones and grants increased million in year  due to receipt of an additional milestone payment from schering plough in march the increased royalties and license fees  milestones and grants was partially offset by the end of research support from schering plough  which terminated june  in we received million in research support from schering plough 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  to million in from million in the increase is primarily related to thelin clinical trials  and expenses associated with regulatory submissions for thelin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increased expense in year resulted from costs associated with building the commercial infrastructure to support the anticipated commercial launch of thelin in such costs include the addition of several key management appointments  including a chief financial officer  chief operating officer  general counsel and vice president of sales  and the addition of a us sales force 
operating loss operating loss increased million  to million in from million in the increased operating loss is primarily due to costs associated with building the commercial infrastructure to support the anticipated commercial launch of thelin  and higher research and development expenses discussed above  partially offset by higher revenues in investment income investment income increased to million in  from million in  as we invested proceeds from the sale of million in notes in march

in and  revotar lost  net of minority interest  million and million  respectively 
net loss net loss increased to million in  from million in  due to higher interest and operating expenses in  partially offset by higher revenues and a gain on the disposition of revotar 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased to million from million compared with year the increase is primarily due to higher royalties earned on sales of argatroban by gsk  which increased from million in to million in royalties earned on sales of argatroban under our agreement with gsk are based upon a tiered structure  which provides for increases in the royalty as a percentage of sales as sales increase 
the increase in royalties is due to higher sales of argatroban  and a corresponding higher royalty rate  as a percentage of sales  in as sales exceeded higher thresholds within the agreement 
such sales thresholds are evaluated annually 
on june   schering plough ended their funding of our research on a follow on compound pursuant to the research agreement 
accordingly  revenues arising under research agreements declined to million in from million in revenues in included million of collaborative research and development from elp prior to the acquisition 
license fees  milestones and grants in included approximately million resulting from the recognition of remaining deferred revenue arising from a milestone payment that had previously been received from mitsubishi 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  to million in from million in  reflecting expenses of completing the stride and related clinical and clinical pharmacological trials 
expenses related to the thelin development program increased million  to million in from million in although enrollment in stride was completed in september  we continued to incur significant expenses related to data gathering and analysis  and preparation of an nda submission for thelin 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  to million in from million in the increase in the current year is primarily due to costs associated with our preparation for the future commercialization of thelin 
operating loss operating loss increased million  to million in from million in the increased operating loss is primarily due to higher operating expenses  partially offset by higher revenues in

liquidity and capital resources year and at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million compared with million at december  we used million in cash from operating activities in year compared to cash used by operating activities of million in the primary operating uses of cash in were to fund the building of a corporate infrastructure to support the anticipated launch of thelin and pay interest on our long term debt  and in both and to fund our general operating expenses and the ongoing research and development programs conducted by encysive and revotar  reduced by cash received from investment income  milestones  and research payments from our collaborative partners 
investing activities are primarily comprised of our investments in debt securities 
cash is generated from investment activities when marketable securities mature and the resulting cash is utilized primarily to fund operating activities 
in  we generated million in investing activities  reflecting the maturities of marketable debt securities  partially offset by purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of million 
in  investing activities used million in cash primarily due to the investments of excess cash in marketable debt securities  loans to revotar and to the purchase of equipment of million

contractual obligations our material contractual obligations are comprised of i million in convertible senior notes  ii obligations under our operating lease agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements  and iii under one research agreement  we could be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee in the event that we elect to terminate the project prior to completion see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are obligated to make semi annual interest payments on the notes of totaling approximately million per year 

table of contents as of december   the company had contractual obligations as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total outlook for we believe royalty revenues in will be comparable to we anticipate that our operating expenses will be significant in  as we intend to enroll patients in additional clinical trials of thelin in other disease applications  and have announced plans to initiate a combination clinical trial involving thelin and a pde compound 
we are also conducting a phase ii dose ranging clinical trial for tbc  and continue development work of compounds in our research pipeline 
we also expect to incur significant expenses related to market research  preparation of educational materials  and other activities in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval and commercialization of thelin 
since the outcome of regulatory filings for thelin in the us  europe  canada and australia is uncertain  we do not anticipate providing specific financial guidance for longer term outlook we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will significantly increase in subsequent years because in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for thelin  we have incurred and will incur significant commercialization expenses 
these costs include market research  hiring a general counsel  vice president of sales  chief financial officer  chief operating officer and other key staff personnel  hiring a marketing and field sales force in the us  canada and europe  establishing appropriate infrastructure to support the field sales force  preparation and production of educational and promotional materials  engaging an advertising agency to support our product promotion  hiring personnel and engaging third party support to administer reimbursement from government and private third party payers  and establishing manufacturing  warehousing and distribution processes for our products 
we expect to incur significant expenses in conjunction with additional clinical trial costs for thelin and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and 
table of contents purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we invest in research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we will require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development of our product candidates  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  if necessary  and to market our products 
estimates of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including expenses and risks associated with clinical trials to expand the indications for thelin  regulatory approval of thelin  including breadth of approved label  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments and changes in our existing research relationships  our administrative costs and costs to commercialize our products will increase as our products are further developed and marketed  working capital requirements to support inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
without considering revenues from thelin  if it receives regulatory approval  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and other revenue sources should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through notwithstanding revenues  which may be produced through sales of potential future products  if approved  we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funds to continue the required levels of research and development to reach our long term goals 
we intend to seek such additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings  bank debt  or  if we choose to do so  collaborative arrangements 
as we assess the options regarding the worldwide marketing of thelin  we will also continue to review the possibility of licensing rights to thelin outside of north america and europe 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have contracts with entities in other areas outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  these currencies have not fluctuated materially
