critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
astea recognizes revenue on its software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
astea recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
in instances where the aforementioned criteria have not been met  both the license and the consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
in limited instances  the company will enter into contracts for which revenue is recognized under contract accounting 
the accounting for such arrangements requires judgment  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and provision for estimated losses  if applicable 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from deferred maintenance  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered  license revenue is deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but for which the company does not have the right to bill the customer per the contract terms 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
capitalized software research and development costs the company accounts for its internal software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed

costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  and other headcount related costs associated with product development 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products usually two years  beginning with the initial release to customers 
during the first quarter of  the company revised the estimated life for its capitalized software products from three years to two year based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances had occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill
