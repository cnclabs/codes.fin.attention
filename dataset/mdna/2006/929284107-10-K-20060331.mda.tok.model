the information contained on our website is not intended to be part of this report 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market and traded under the symbol wjci 
acquisitions we have completed two acquisitions in connection with the implementation of our business strategy to acquire and develop new and complementary technologies 
on january  we completed our acquisition of telenexus  inc telenexus 
pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated january   by and between us  wj newco  llc the wj sub  telenexus and richard j 
swanson  wilfred k 
lau  david fried  kurt christensen and mark sutton the shareholders 
telenexus was merged with and into the wj sub effective on january  the wj sub was the survivor in the merger and is our wholly owned subsidiary 
telenexus designs  develops  manufactures and markets radio frequency identification rfid reader products for a broad range of industries and markets 
by virtue of the merger  we purchased through the wj sub all of the assets necessary for the conduct of the rfid business of telenexus  consisting primarily of  and including  but not limited to rfid modules  baseband processing algorithm technology  applications software and realizations of several reader product designs 
the consideration we paid on the closing date in connection with the merger consisted of cash in the amount of million  which was paid out of our cash reserves on the closing date  and  shares of our common stock valued at million at the closing date 
including acquisition costs of  the aggregate purchase price for the net assets of telenexus totaled million 
of the closing consideration  cash in the amount of  and  shares of our common stock are being held in escrow with respect to any indemnification matter under the merger agreement 
the outstanding cash balance of the escrow account less any properly noticed unpaid or contested amounts was to be distributed within two days after october  we released the full amount of the cash balance of the escrow account on october  the  shares in the escrow account less any shares for any properly noticed unpaid or contested amounts will be distributed within five days after july  the fair value of our common stock was determined based on the average closing price per share of our common stock over a day period beginning two trading days before and ending two trading days after the amended terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced january  
in addition to the closing consideration  the sellers may be entitled to further compensation of up to up to million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock if we achieve certain revenue targets by july  any change in the fair value of the net assets of telenexus or any additional consideration to the shareholders will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

on june   we completed our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic corporation  a california corporation and eic enterprises limited together eic 
the aggregate purchase price was million which included consideration to eic in the form of payments of cash of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million  as well as acquisition related costs we incurred of million and  of estimated registration statement related expenses reduced by a  benefit from the termination settlement of the associated supply agreement with eic recognized during our quarter ended december  in connection with the acquisition  million in cash and  shares of common stock were held in escrow as security against certain financial contingencies 
on march   we made a claim against the escrow account for unpaid invoices issued under the supply agreement 
we received those funds on may  the uncontested amount was released to eic on april  per the escrow agreement and the residual balance of the million was released to eic on may  the  shares in the escrow account less any shares for any properly noticed unpaid or contested amounts will be distributed within five days after march  on november  we filed a registration statement registering for resale by the seller of up to  shares of our common stock issued in the acquisition 
in addition to the closing consideration  eic was originally entitled to further consideration of up to million and million in cash and shares of our common stock if certain revenue and gross margin targets were achieved by march  and march   respectively 
we have determined that the revenue and gross margin targets were not met for the nine month period ending march  eic subsequently notified us that it disagrees with our conclusion that the revenue and gross margin targets were not met for the nine month period ending march  while we believe eic s assertions are without merit and has notified eic of such  there can be no assurances as to the eventual outcome of this matter 
if we achieve certain revenue targets by march   we will be obligated to pay eic the remaining contingent consideration of up to million  ninety percent in our common stock and ten percent in cash 
the number of shares of our common stock to be delivered is to be determined by dividing the value in dollars of the portion payable in our common stock by the average closing price of our common stock  as quoted on the nasdaq national market  during the ten consecutive trading days ending one trading day before the end of the period covered by the payment  provided  however  that in the event that the calculation of the average closing price results in a price per share for the first payment that would be less than or for the second payment that would be less than  then we  at our option  in our sole discretion  may elect to make the payment part or all in cash and the balance  if any  in shares of our common stock 
if eic receives such consideration  the amounts will be recorded as an increase to goodwill 
as of march  we have not yet determined if the revenue targets were met for the year ending march  we will not be able to make our determination until after we have completed our internal control procedures after our quarter end on april  the fair value of our common stock was determined based on the average closing price per share of our common stock over a day period beginning two trading days before and ending two trading days after the amended terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced june  
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sales we sell our products to a broad group of communications original equipment manufacturers oems and their suppliers and subcontractors 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in managing our inventory requirements 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
sales to our customers which individually account for more than of our total annual sales were  in aggregate   and of our sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the identity of our customers who contributed greater than of our total sales for each of the preceding three years and the annual amount of those sales  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
if the markets for our products decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced with a significant negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped and title has passed to the customer  we have the right to invoice the customer at a fixed price  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
generally  title passes upon shipment of our products 
certain contracts are under a consignment arrangement under which title to our products does not pass until the customer utilizes these products in its production processes 
as a consequence  we recognize revenue on these contracts only when the customer notifies us of product consumption 
we may enter into fixed price development contracts with customers 
revenue under development agreements is recognized when applicable contractual non refundable milestones have been met  including deliverables  and in any case  does not exceed the amount that would be recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based on the actual physical completion of work performed and the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
generally  the selling prices of our products tend to decrease over time as a result of increased volumes or general competitive pressures and in general we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases or these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs of product components  production wages  taxes and benefits  costs of assembly and test by third party contract manufacturers  wafer costs from third party semiconductor foundries  labor contracted on a temporary basis  supplies consumed in the manufacturing process  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing and test equipment and leasehold improvements  lease expense for our manufacturing facilities  allocated occupancy costs  scrapped material used in the production process  and write downs of excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
we have not recognized any such losses during  or operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into two general categories research and development  and selling and administrative 
we classify all charges to these two categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these two categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that are typically included in these categories  such as wages  fringe benefit costs  depreciation and allocated overhead 
research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we generate revenues from development contracts with customers that have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
recapitalization merger in september we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of the company s common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders the acquisition proposal 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
our recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of expenses incurred by the special committee to our board of directors to review the proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
restructuring charge our restructuring charge reflects our decision to abandon a leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
it is comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge on tenant improvements 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate based on the current market conditions 
our restructuring charge reflects further consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties encountered in subleasing the available space 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication fab within one year 
as a result of the planned fab closure  we accrued associated severance expenses  accrued the eventual abandonment of additional excess space for which we will have a remaining two year commitment and recorded an impairment on our internal wafer fabrication equipment and related leasehold improvements 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
during  we reversed the lease loss associated with our fab and remaining severance accrual due to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our fab as we believed at that time that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
this reversal was partially offset by a net increase in the lease loss accrual for our other leased facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
effective for our second quarter ended july   we changed the application of our revenue recognition policy regarding our distributors 
we had previously recognized revenue upon shipment to our distributors less estimated reserves for distributor right of return  authorized price reductions for specific end customer sales opportunities and price protection based on known events and historical trends 
effective for our second quarter ended july   we recognize revenue from our distribution channels when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer 
historically  we have received stock rotation requests from our distributors that were within the amounts estimated and contractually allowed with only one exception of an insignificant amount 
however  the request for stock rotation during our second quarter ended july  was higher than the amount contractually allowed 
our management  with the concurrence of our audit committee  believes the increasing percentage of new products introduced by us makes it likely that stock rotation reserves will continue to be difficult to estimate based on historical patterns and contractual provisions 
based on this change in facts and circumstances and our management s future expectations  we believe that we can no longer reasonably estimate the amount of future returns from our distributors as of july  accordingly  recognition of revenue and associated cost of sales on shipments to distributors is deferred until the resale to the end customer 
this change in application resulted in a million revenue deferral in our second quarter of although revenue is deferred until resale  title of products sold to distributors transfers upon shipment 
accordingly  shipments to distributors are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable and a reduction of inventories at the time of shipment 
deferred revenue and the corresponding cost of sales on shipments to distributors are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis as deferred margin on distributor inventory 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
through the quarter ended april   revenues from our distributors were recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed or determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believed we could reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  we accrued a reserve based on our reasonable estimate of future returns based on historical trends and contractual limitations 
per contractual agreement  the distributor may return product three times per year under the following conditions the total value of inventory returned shall not exceed an amount equal to of the total value of the distributor s stock on hand of our products as reported in the prior month s inventory report  the inventory is returned no earlier than months and no later than months from the date of the original invoice date and the product s packaging has not been opened or any alteration or modification has been performed on the part 
due to our change in application of our revenue recognition policy regarding our distributors  we no longer accrue a distributor stock rotation reserve 
as of december  and  our distributor stock rotation reserve was  and  respectively 
beginning in september  we entered into a program where the distributor would receive a credit if it sold specific product at a reduced price to specific end customers pre authorized by us 
we maintain a log of all such pre authorized price reductions which we accrue as a reduction to revenue in the period that the pre authorization occurs per issue of eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
as of december   and  our ship debit allowance was   and  respectively 
if we reduce the prices of our products as negotiated with the distributor  the distributor may receive a credit for the difference between the price paid by the distributor and the reduced price on applicable unsold products remaining in the distributor s inventory on the effective date of the price reduction assuming that inventory is less than months old as determined by the original invoice date 
when we recognized revenue upon shipment to our distributors  we reserved for distributor price protection per issue of eitf based on specific identification of our initiated price reductions and the associated reported distributor inventory 
there were no such price reductions in  or we may enter into contracts to perform research and development for others meeting the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
research and development arrangements 
revenue under these development agreements is recognized when applicable contractual non refundable milestones have been met  including deliverables  and in any case  does not exceed the amount that would be recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based on the actual physical completion of work performed and the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete the contract in accordance with accounting research bulletin long term construction type contracts using the relevant guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
given the duration and nature of these development contracts  we believe that recognizing revenue under the percentage completion method best represents the legal and economic results of contract performance on a timely basis 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
these development contracts with customers have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
the achievement of contractual milestones is evidenced by written documentation provided by the customer in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each contract 
in any period  progress on the contract is based on input measures direct labor dollars  direct material costs and direct outside processing costs in the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
estimated costs to complete are provided by engineering personnel directly involved in the development program and are reviewed by management and finance personnel for reasonableness given the known facts and circumstances 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
if we bill the customer prior to performing services under the development agreement  the amounts are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recorded revenue of  under development agreements in we have no deferred revenue at december  no comparable amounts were included in or write down of excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production generally based on a rolling twelve month demand forecast  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill and purchased technology 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value  and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year 
income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies we have established reserves for income tax contingencies 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities including our tax filings for to the reserves represent our best estimate of the probable amount for our liability of income taxes  interest and penalties 
the actual liability could differ significantly from the amount of the reserve  which could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million resulted from a revision of our estimated income tax contingency liability due to our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service related to the audit of the company s through tax returns 
in addition  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
these charges include abandoned leased properties comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and asset impairment charges on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining these estimates  we make certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflect offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a further significant change in market conditions  the ultimate losses on these could be higher and such amount could be material 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in and also recorded additional charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in  primarily due to changes in estimated sublease income 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for an estimated four months of additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates 
during  we recorded a reversal of million related to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our internal wafer fabrication facility fab as we believed at that time that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
as such  we reversed million of our lease loss accrual and  of our severance accrual 
this credit was partially offset by an additional  lease loss accrual as we revised our lease loss assumptions for our facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
the leased property abandonments have resulted in an average per year benefit of million in reduced lease expense and  in reduced amortization of leasehold improvements which will continue through the leased property abandonments had no effect on our future cash flows 
the collective asset impairments have resulted in an average per year benefit of million in reduced depreciation expense of manufacturing equipment which will continue through the equipment deemed excess in was ultimately sold for million 
otherwise  the asset impairments had no effect on our future cash flows 
the workforce reductions have resulted in reduced wages and benefits of million per year with a corresponding reduction in cash flows 
in total the restructuring plans have benefited our results of operations on average as follows since million reduction in cost of goods sold  million reduction in research and development expense and million reduction in selling and administrative expense 
except for changes in the sublease estimates noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the restructuring charge 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing processes obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisons set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations

the increase in sales both periods reflects the increase in our semiconductor and radio frequency identification rfid sales mitigated by the declines in our wireless integrated assembly and fiber optic sales reflecting our strategic decision to focus our competitive advantage and dedicate our resources to the radio frequency rf semiconductor market 
semiconductor and rfid sales during were million  representing of total sales which was a million or increase in comparison to the comparable s sales of million of total sales 
semiconductor and rfid sales during increased million or in comparison to sales of million of total sales 
the increase in our semiconductor and rfid sales during primarily related to our increasing sales in asia particularly china  which increased and korea  which increased  our expanded product offering due to our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business from eic corporation representing million of our semiconductor and rfid sales in compared to million in after the acquisition in june and an increase in our expanded rfid product offering due to our acquisition of telenexus representing million of our sales in during  we have experienced an approximate decrease in the average selling price of our semiconductor products due to competitive pressure 
the increase in our sales was partially offset by a change in the application of our revenue recognition policy from revenue recognition upon shipment to our distributors to revenue recognition when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer as discussed above under critical accounting policies and estimates 
this change in application resulted in a million revenue deferral in our second quarter of which is reflected in year ended december  for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the increase in our semiconductor and rfid sales during related to an increase in the volume of products sold due  in part  to our introduction of over new products including our mpr family of pcmcia form factor uhf rfid readers and our power amplifier modules for pas phs telecommunication networks in china  our expanded product offering due to our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business from eic corporation representing million of our semiconductor and rfid sales in and our increasing sales in the united states increase in and asia particularly china  which increased in 
during our average selling price of our semiconductor products increased by approximately due to new product introductions 
also in  approximately  of our semiconductor and rfid sales resulted from sales of product to eic under a supply agreement we entered into with them as part our acquisition of their wireless infrastructure business and associated assets 
this supply agreement was substantially completed by december  and there will be no significant sales from these products in future periods 
in  approximately  of our semiconductor and rfid sales resulted from sales of our thin film products 
in may we sold our thin film product line to m a com a unit of tyco electronics 
wireless integrated assembly and fiber optic sales for totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of million or from sales of million of total sales in as these products have reached the end of their product life cycle  they only represented  of our sales in lucent technologies was the major customer for our wireless integrated assembly products 
during  they decided to design the next generation of this type of product themselves and build it through the use of contract manufacturers 
during our third quarter ended september   they notified us that they would no longer purchase significant quantities of these products and might only purchase moderate quantities for their customers who may need to expand or maintain older telecommunications networks 
the decline in our wireless integrated assembly sales over the last two years contributed to the decline in our sales to europe 
as these products have reached the end of their product life cycle  they will not be a significant factor in our long term business 
aside from potential and infrequent life time buys  our focus will predominantly be supporting the existing product base 
based on the current business trends in the target markets our products address  we believe that our revenue for our first quarter of will be in the range of to million equalling or showing a slight increase from our recently completed fourth quarter 
based on the same trends  we currently believe that our revenue will be in the range of to million for cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  an increase of million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in our cost of goods sold for decreased by  or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold increased to in from in which decreased from in the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars reflects an increased percentage of newer products in our product sales mix which have not yet achieved the volumes or yields of our more mature products 
this decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales in reflects the change in our product sales mix to a greater percentage of higher margin semiconductor products from relatively lower margin wireless assembly products 
this reduction in direct costs was partially offset by increased indirect cost of goods sold of  for manufacturing supplies   for equipment maintenance and  for increased manufacturing support staff all due to increased volume production including the product lines we acquired from eic 
in absolute dollars  the decrease in cost of goods sold reflects the factors previously noted 
we continue to experience unabsorbed overhead costs related to underutilization of our existing wafer fabrication facility 
while prior restructuring programs have mitigated some of our unabsorbed overhead through the write down of excess facilities and equipment  we will still have fixed manufacturing costs that these efforts will not impact until we can further reduce excess capacity 
we typically generate a lower gross margin on new product introductions which we expect to be a higher percentage of our sales mix going forward 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through improved yields 
new product lines also contain a greater degree of inventory risk due to uncertainty regarding a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition 
research and development our research and development expense was million  an increase of  or as compared with our research and development expense of million for our research and development for increased by  or as compared with research and development expense of million in the increase in absolute dollars in is primarily related to the increased engineering staff and new product development related to the products we acquired from telenexus and increased spending on design consulting services which was partially offset by a decrease in overall overhead 
the increase in absolute dollars in is primarily related to the increased engineering staff and new product development efforts related to the products and processes we acquired from eic and increased spending on design consulting services which was largely offset by a decrease in overall overhead 
during  research and development expenses were as a percentage of sales which compares to in and in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to reflects the factors noted above as well as the decrease in sales in the same period 
the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to is primarily related to our increase in sales 
we generate revenues from development contracts with customers that have enabled us to accelerate our own product development efforts 
such development revenues have only partially funded our product development activities  and we generally retain ownership of the products developed under these arrangements 
as a result  we classify all development costs related to these contracts as research and development expenses 
we recorded revenue of  under such development agreements in product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue to make investments in new product development and engineering talent 
in we will continue to focus our research efforts and resources on rf semiconductor development which target multiple growth markets such as rfid and wimax  adjacent markets such as power amplifiers while expanding our addressable market opportunities in wireless communications and broadband cable 
we will also explore process capabilities of third party foundries and develop products under new process technologies such as sige bicmos 
in absolute dollars  we expect our research and development expenditures to remain relatively constant with the prior year 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  an increase of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in during selling and administrative expense increased by million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the increase in absolute dollars during related to a million charge for a former ceo separation agreement  a  increase related to the acquired administrative operations of telenexus   of professional fees related to a potential strategic business combination which we decided not to consummate  a  increase in legal fees resulting from additional corporate governance requirements   charge related to severance and a  increase in external sales representatives commission due to the increase in semiconductor sales over the prior year s period 
these increased costs were partially offset by a  decrease in bonus expense and a  decrease in insurance premiums 
the increase in absolute dollars during is primarily related to a  increase in salaries and wages due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel   increase in severance due to a stock compensation charge resulting from the modification of two option agreements extension of the option exercise period  a  increase in accounting fees resulting from additional corporate governance requirements   increase in commission costs due to increased sales of our radio frequency rf semiconductor products and a  increase in bonus expense 
additionally  during  we benefited from a reduction in our board of directors compensation plan which was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders held on july  and resulted in a reduction in accrued expenses of  also  had benefited from the collection of  of receivables which had been reserved in a prior period 
during  we reserved  of receivables whose collection is doubtful 
these increased costs were partially offset by a  reduction in our directors and officers and liability insurance premiums and a  decrease in advertising and promotion costs 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expense from to reflects the factors noted above as well as the decrease in sales in the same period 
selling and administrative expenses remained flat from to as a percentage of sales 
for our first quarter of  we expect selling and administrative expenses to be higher than those incurred in our fourth quarter of primarily as a result of approximately  in professional service costs associated with a special project conducted on behalf of our audit committee and completed during that quarter with no material issues 
acquired in process research and development expenses during  million of the purchase price for the acquisition of telenexus  inc was allocated to acquired in process research and development expense iprd 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is minimal remaining risk relating to the development 
the value assigned to iprd charge comprises the following projects multi protocol readers million  smart readers  and class readers million 
as of december   the estimated aggregate cost to complete these projects was  million and  respectively which is expected to occur through our fourth quarter of the value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the iprd projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
our assumptions for the multi protocol reader project at the time of the acquisition include an estimated completion date of the project in at a cost of approximately  estimated future revenue of million over an estimated product life cycle of years  and the following average financial metrics over the life of the product gross margin of during the first two years increasing to by year five and remaining constant throughout the remainder of the estimation periods  average operating expenses of and a tax rate

a discount rate of was employed to determine the discounted net cash flow for all projects 
during  million of the purchase price for the acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic was allocated to acquired in process research and development expense iprd 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
the iprd charge related to the eic acquisition which was made up of two projects v heterojunction bipolar transistor hbt power amplifiers and v hbt high power amplifiers which had an assigned value of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we have completed both the v and v hbt high power amplifier process development projects 
the value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the iprd projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
our assumptions for the v hbt project at the time of the acquisition include an estimated completion date of the project in early at a cost of approximately  estimated future revenue of million over an estimated product life cycle of years  and the following average financial metrics over the life of the product gross margin of  operating expenses of and a tax rate

the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can meet its design specification including function  features and technical performance requirements 
therefore  the amount allocated to in process research and development has been charged to operations 
recapitalization merger we incurred recapitalization merger expense of  in related to our consideration of the proposed fox paine transaction 
on september   we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders the acquisition proposal 
at that time  fox paine and its affiliates owned approximately of our outstanding shares or million shares of a total of million shares outstanding 
our board of directors formed a special committee composed of two independent directors not affiliated with fox paine the special committee to review the acquisition proposal 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
restructuring charges during  we reversed the lease loss associated with our internal wafer fabrication facility fab and remaining severance accrual due to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our fab as we believed at that time that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
this reversal was partially offset by a net increase in the lease loss accrual for our other leased facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
in  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million reflecting consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
in the third quarter of  we decided to abandon a portion of our leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess space  for which we had a remaining eight year commitment  is located on the first floor of our current corporate headquarters and originally housed a portion of our optics and integrated assemblies manufacturing operations 
this decision resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
in addition  our management made a decision during the third quarter of to exit the fiber optics business after current contractual obligations had been satisfied 
this decision resulted in a significant overcapacity of certain manufacturing equipment and we initiated a plan to sell this equipment before the end of the first quarter of our excess manufacturing equipment resulted in a total charge of million 
assets to be held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
management determined fair market value after consideration of several factors including the condition of the equipment  offers made by potential buyers of the equipment and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
the majority of these impaired assets was sold in the fourth quarter of also during the third quarter of  our management identified manufacturing equipment exclusively supporting certain in warranty optics and fixed wireless products as well as manufacturing equipment supporting final orders for certain other optics and fixed wireless products and determined that the estimated future cash flows did not support the carrying value of these assets 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets  which management determined after consideration of several factors including the condition and management s intended use of the equipment  offers made for similar equipment the company intended to sell and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a  asset impairment charge 
during  we incurred severance expense of  related to a reduction of employees 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication 
as a result of the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility  approximately of the company s workforce employees would have been eliminated  which would have resulted in severance payments of  the closure of this facility would have resulted in additional excess space of approximately  square feet for which we had a remaining two year commitment at that time 
this decision resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
this decision triggered an impairment analysis under sfas no 
management measured the recoverability of these assets through a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets over their remaining year of life 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that were expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets 
management estimated the future cash flows using a traditional present value approach based on management s assumptions regarding the intended use of these assets consistent with the company s budget and projections as well as the planned eventual disposition of the asset group through sale 
management estimated the disposition value of these assets after consideration of several factors including the condition and management s intended use of the equipment  offers made for similar equipment the company intended to sell and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
management employed a risk free interest rate commensurate with the company s size  capital structure and stock volatility in relation to the overall market 
this action resulted in a million asset impairment charge 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision to abandon an excess facility 
in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we had a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties subleasing our available space 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of the current market conditions

interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
in our interest income was million  an increase of  or as compared with interest income of  in this relative dollar increase in both comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest rates offsetting a decrease in average funds available for investment 
our interest income for of  had decreased  or as compared with interest income of  in this decrease primarily resulted from decreased average amounts of funds available for investment 
interest expense our interest expense for was  a decrease of  or as compared with interest expense of  in and a decrease of  or as is compared with interest expense of  in interest expense for all periods relates to fees associated with our revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit 
other income net the other income realized in was primarily related to a million gain we recorded related to the sale of our thin film product line 
the sale includes equipment  inventory  intellectual property  training and services for which we received total proceeds of million 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
income tax benefit in we recorded a net tax benefit of  as the statute had expired on certain estimated federal tax exposures 
the tax benefit for of million resulted from a revision of our estimated income tax contingency liability due to our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service related to the audit of the company s through tax returns 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of  related to an income tax refund of  from the state of maryland as the result of amending our state tax return and an adjustment to our tax contingency liability of  for additional federal income tax refund determined after finalizing our carryback claim filed in the first quarter of and miscellaneous tax payments 
beginning in  it was determined that it was not more likely than not that any additional deferred tax assets would be realized through the application of carryforward claims 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million or compared to the balance of million at december  on december   we entered into the fourth amendment the amendment to our amended and restated loan and security agreement between comerica bank and us dated september  and as amended june   july  and september  the effective date of the amendment is december  under the new terms  the revolving credit facility revolving facility provides for a maximum credit extension of million  with a million sub limit to support letters of credit  a  sub limit for foreign exchange transactions and a  sub limit for corporate credit cards 
the revolving facility matures on december  interest rates on outstanding borrowings are periodically adjusted based on certain financial ratios and are initially set  at our option  at libor plus or prime 
the revolving facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and contains limitations on  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends and make acquisitions without the bank s permission 
the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  as of december  and december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility 
we have letters of credit of million available as of december  against which no amounts have been drawn 
net cash used by operating activities net cash used by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net loss in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the most significant cash item impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows used in operations in was  used by working capital 
the  used by working capital primarily relates to a million decrease in restructuring liabilities which were partially offset by a million increase in accruals and accounts payable and a  decrease in inventories 
the million decrease in restructuring liabilities primarily relates to payments against the remaining lease loss accrual 
the million increase in accruals and accounts payable relates primarily to the timing of payments within terms 
non cash items included in net loss in included million of depreciation and amortization  million of iprd related to our acquisition of telenexus  inc and million related to an increase in our deferred margin on distributor inventory due to our change in the application of our revenue recognition policy from revenue recognition upon shipment to our distributors to revenue recognition when our distributors have sold the product to the end customer during for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the most significant cash item impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows used in operations in was million used in working capital 
the million used in working capital primarily relates to a million increase in receivables  a million decrease in restructuring liabilities  a million increase in other assets and a decrease of  in income tax contingency liability 
our receivables increased million due to increased shipments during the fourth quarter of the million decrease in restructuring liabilities primarily relates to payments against the remaining lease loss accrual 
the increase in other assets of million is primarily due to a  accrual of a settlement related to the termination of the supply agreement with eic see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k and a  increase in accrued interest receivable related to our investments 
the decrease of  in income taxes payable relates to payments resulting from an audit of our through returns 
non cash items included in net loss in included million of depreciation and amortization  million of iprd related to our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic and million related to a decrease in our income tax contingency liability 
the million decrease in our income tax contingency liability resulted from a revised estimate related to the audit of our through tax returns 
the million decrease in our tax contingency liability resulted from a revised estimate of our tax contingency liability related to the audit of our through tax returns as a result of our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service 
the most significant cash items impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows used in operations in were  used in working capital and million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets 
the  used in working capital primarily relates to a million decrease in restructuring liabilities  which was offset by a million decrease in inventories 
the million decrease in inventories relates to the decrease in our sales from million in to million in the million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets relates to the receipt of an income tax refund generated by the carryback of our net operating loss 
starting in the second quarter of  we provided more favorable payment terms to significant customers in order to remain competitive in the current business environment 
as a result  our average payment terms have increased from days to days  which has had a negative impact to our working capital 
non cash items included in net loss in included million of depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided used by investing activities net cash provided used by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we used million to purchase short term investments  million to acquire telenexus  inc including associated acquisition costs and million to purchase equipment which was partially offset by million in proceeds we realized from the sale and maturities of our short term investments 
in  we realized million in proceeds from the sale of short term investments which was partially offset by million used to purchase short term investments  million of acquisition and costs related to the eic transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k and  to invest in property  plant and equipment 
in  we used million to purchase short term investments and  to invest in property  plant and equipment which was partially offset by million provided by our sale of short term investments and million proceeds from the sale of our thin film product line see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
during  we expect to invest approximately to million in capital expenditures 
we have funded our capital expenditures from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and expect to continue to do so throughout in conjunction with our recent acquisitions  we may be required to pay further compensation in the eic acquisition of up to million in cash and shares if specific revenue targets are achieved by march  and in the telenexus acquisition  of up to million in cash and up to  shares if certain revenue targets are achieved by july  we expect to fund these payments  if earned  from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available 
as of march  we have not yet determined if the revenue targets were met for the year ending march  we will not be able to make our determination until after we have completed our internal control procedures after our quarter end on april  net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and  in  and  respectively 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans which was partially offset by  representing  shares of our common stock withheld from our former ceo to cover the income tax withholding on his receipt of  shares of restricted stock in connection with a severance agreement and  representing shares withheld from other employees 
in  we received net proceeds of million related to our secondary public offering of million newly issued shares of our common stock and million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans which was partially offset by  of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our current stock repurchase program see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
in  we received net cash of million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our option plans which was partially offset by million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total we lease our three facilities  including our executive offices in san jose  california  under lease agreements that expire at various dates through total future lease obligations as of december   were million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring accrual current and long term 
purchase obligations are primarily orders for raw material  processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
while the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
the only component of other long term liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a restructuring accrual of million relating to the future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plans see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we will make these payments through we included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above 
excluding payments under the operating lease component included in the restructuring accrual  the other components of other long term liabilities do not contractually require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of estimated operating costs on restructured facilities  deferred rent and estimated environmental costs 
the table above does not include contractual obligations related to our acquisition in june of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic corporation or our acquisition in january of telenexus  inc as the additional consideration is contingent on certain future identifiable events which have not occurred as of december  eic may be entitled to further consideration of up to million in cash and shares of our common stock if certain revenue targets are achieved by march  we shall pay eic this additional consideration  if earned  ninety percent in our common stock and ten percent in cash 
thus  if earned   would be payable in less than one year as of march  we have not yet determined if the revenue targets were met for the year ending march  we will not be able to make our determination until after we have completed our internal control procedures after our quarter end on april  the sellers of telenexus  inc may be entitled to further compensation of up to million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock if we achieve certain revenue targets by july  thus  if earned  million would be payable in one to three years 
certain employment agreements which may require us to pay out termination benefits upon future identifiable events are also excluded from the table above as no events have occurred as of december  which make the payment probable 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
other matters recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
we adopted sfas r in january and currently do not expect to restate prior periods to conform to the new accounting standard as we will use the modified prospective application method 
under this method sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k under the caption stock based compensation for information related to the pro forma effect on reported net income and net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of the sfas the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional future stock option and other share base awards  our future stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants 
the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
we are currently in the process of determining our estimated forfeiture rate for purposes of adopting sfas r and we estimate that our forfeiture rate will be between and  which will result in a reduction to the foregoing annual amoritization amounts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted expected maturity average interest expected maturity dates amounts rate in thousands cash equivalents short term investments fair value at december
