the company used the cash generated from its operating activities to pay for capital expenditures  pay down debt and complete the acquisition of phase seven laboratories 
overall  net cash decreased by  in fiscal  compared to an increase of  in fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from development  qualification and production testing and engineering services for commercial products  space systems and military equipment of all types 
the company also provides technical staffing  qualification of safety related systems and components  and iso certification services 
revenue from fixed price testing contracts is generally recorded upon completion of the contracts  which are generally short term  or upon completion of identifiable contractual tasks 
at the time the company enters into a contract that includes multiple tasks  the company estimates the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience 
revenues are recognized which provide for a profit margin relative to the testing performed 
revenue relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based is recorded as effort is expended 
billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified 
to the extent management does not accurately forecast the level of effort required to complete a contract  or individual tasks within a contract  and the company is unable to negotiate additional billings with a customer for cost over runs  the company may incur losses on individual contracts 
all selling  general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and other out of pocket expenses are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in operating costs and expenses 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses a combination of write off history  aging analysis and any specific known troubled accounts in determining the allowance 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventories inventories consist of accumulated costs including direct labor  material and overhead applicable to uncompleted contracts and are stated at actual cost  which is not in excess of estimated net realizable value 
such inventories for each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis over the life of the contract and additional write downs of inventories are made if there are insufficient revenues remaining on the contract 
deferred income taxes at january   the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of  the company has recorded this asset as it believes that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the asset through reduction of future taxable income 
the company bases this belief upon the levels of taxable income historically generated by its business  as well as projections of future taxable income 
if future levels of taxable income are not consistent with its expectations  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance  which could reduce its net income by a material amount 
at january   the company was in a net deferred tax loss position of  recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income based on their fair values 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec extended the adoption date for statement r until the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after june   which in the case of national technical systems  inc will be the first quarter ending april  as permitted by statement  through january   the company accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method is expected to reduce earnings per share by less than 
per share on a quarterly basis  beginning in fiscal year had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share presented above 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such tax deductions were   and  respectively  for the years ended january   and the pro forma information in the accompanying financial statements presents the estimated compensation charges under statement the company s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the company will recognize the compensation cost for stock based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term revolving line of credit arrangement 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical one percentage point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect interest expense by  at january  as compared to  at january  environmental matters an internal environmental compliance group formed in continues to review environmental matters for the company 
although the company s business does not involve the manufacture or extensive use of hazardous substances  the company does have a program to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws at its various testing facilities  which includes conducting regular internal audits to identify and categorize potential environmental exposure 
the company s santa clarita  california test facility is located immediately adjacent to property owned by a third party which has been the subject of extensive environmental remediation 
the adjacent site has  in the past  been used for manufacture of solid rocket fuel propellants  munitions and flares that contained perchlorate  a hazardous substance 
soil samples taken from the santa clarita property in were inconclusive as to the existence of perchlorate 
heavy rainfall last year resulted in a run off from the adjacent site onto the santa clarita property 
the company arranged for samples to be taken of the surface water from the adjacent site and early indications are that the tested water contains high levels of perchlorate 
further testing will be conducted in cooperation with the government agency having oversight responsibility for the adjacent site 
no cleanup activity has been conducted on the santa clarita property and it has yet to be determined whether remediation will be required at the site  or  if required  the extent and cost of any remediation 
the company believes that in the event it does incur remediation costs that it will have valid claims for indemnification against the owner of the adjacent site and the municipality that built a road between the adjacent site and the santa clarita property that appears to have contributed to the runoff from the adjacent site 
recovery of such remediation costs may  however  be uncertain and may involve significant litigation expense 
impact of inflation the company continues to incur increased costs in the areas of wages  insurance  workers compensation  and utilities which it cannot pass along to customers in the current economic environment 
to date  these increases have been partially offset by reductions in other operating areas through improved efficiencies 
the company can give no assurances  however  that in the future it can offset such increased costs

and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements january   and summary of significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of national technical systems  inc nts or the company and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company has consolidated nqa  inc  a owned subsidiary for which the distribution of profits and losses is to the company  and to the other shareholder 
nts controls the management decisions and elects the president of nqa  inc and therefore has complete operating control of the subsidiary 
xxcal japan is a owned subsidiary which started in fiscal and is accounted for under the equity method since nts does not have management or board control 
the equity investment is  and  at january  and  respectively 
risks and uncertainties the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates made by the company relate primarily to the recognition of revenue under long term contracts and valuation of contract claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from development  qualification and production testing and engineering services for commercial products  space systems and military equipment of all types 
the company also provides technical staffing  qualification of safety related systems and components  and iso certification services 
revenue from fixed price testing contracts is generally recorded upon completion of the contracts  which are generally short term  or upon completion of identifiable contractual tasks 
at the time the company enters into a contract that includes multiple tasks  the company estimates the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience 
revenues are recognized which provide for a profit margin relative to the testing performed 
revenue relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based is recorded as effort is expended 
billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified 
to the extent management does not accurately forecast the level of effort required to complete a contract  or individual tasks within a contract  and the company is unable to negotiate additional billings with a customer for cost over runs  the company may incur losses on individual contracts 
all selling  general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and other out of pocket expenses are included in revenues and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in operating costs and expenses

national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment 
the goodwill test for impairment consists of a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step of the test is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test includes a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit that has associated goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the company has identified three reporting units in the engineering and evaluation segment and one reporting unit in the technical solutions segment  which constitute components of its business that include goodwill 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and has determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the reporting unit s carrying amount  and no impairment was indicated 
long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets with determinable lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the company evaluates events or changes in circumstances based on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and forecasts  general and industry trends and  economic projections and anticipated cash flows 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in earnings 
stock based compensation the company has elected to continue to follow apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its employee stock options because  as discussed below  the alternative fair value accounting provided under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized in the company s financial statements  since the exercise price of the company s employee stock options is not less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to january  under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options granted reported below has been estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions expected life in years risk free interest rate expected volatility expected dividend yield national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of the traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
because the company s options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in the opinion of management  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its options 
the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during was per share 
had compensation cost for the company s stock option plan been determined consistent with the fair value method outlined in sfas no 
 the company s net income and earnings per share would have been as indicated below january  january  january  net income as reported pro forma basic earnings per common share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per common share as reported pro forma comprehensive income in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  the company is required to report and display the components of comprehensive income including unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments 
the effect of the foreign currency translation was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
accumulated other comprehensive income was  and accumulated other comprehensive loss was  as of january  and  respectively  due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
earnings per share basic and diluted net income per common share is presented in conformity with sfas no 
 earnings per share for all periods presented 
in accordance with sfas no 
 basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year 
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options  warrants and convertible securities 
foreign currency translation the accounts of the foreign divisions are translated into united states dollars in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
all balance sheet accounts  except for certain fixed assets accounts  have been translated using the current rate of exchange at the balance sheet date 
results of national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued operations have been translated using the average rates prevailing throughout the year 
translation gains or losses resulting from the changes in the exchange rates from year to year are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity 
the translation of the balance sheet accounts resulted in  and  in unrealized gain in fiscal years and  respectively

revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in income based on their fair values 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec extended the adoption date for statement r until the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after june   which in the case of national technical systems  inc will be the first quarter ending april  as permitted by statement  through january   the company accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method is expected to reduce earnings per share by less than 
per share on a quarterly basis  beginning in fiscal year had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that national technical systems  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued january   and summary of significant accounting policies continued standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share presented above 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such tax deductions were   and  respectively  for the years ended january   and the pro forma information in the accompanying financial statements presents the estimated compensation charges under statement the company s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the company will recognize the compensation cost for stock based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award
