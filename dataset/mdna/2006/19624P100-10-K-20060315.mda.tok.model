item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of our revenues  costs and expenses our lighting systems revenues include amounts from the sale of our led lighting systems as well as any fees from our customers for applications engineering  integration or technical support services we provide to assist them in specifying  designing  installing and operating our systems 
our oem and licensing revenues include amounts from the sale of our oem products  license fees and related fees attributable to the licensing of our proprietary technology  and fees for any engineering support services that are requested by our oem and licensing customers 
our cost of lighting systems revenues and cost of oem and license revenues consist primarily of the cost of the lighting products sold  including amounts paid to our contract manufacturers  the costs of any components that we provide  other direct and indirect manufacturing support costs  shipping and handling  tooling and provisions for product warranty  scrap and inventory obsolescence  as well as overhead cost allocated to these activities 
it may also include an allocation of salaries and related benefits of engineering personnel when they provide engineering support services for which we charge fees 
our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel expense and related benefits of personnel engaged in sales  product management and marketing activities  commissions paid to our manufacturers representatives  costs of marketing programs and promotional materials  trade show expenses and overhead cost related to these activities 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel engaged in research and development and product quality activities  out of pocket product development costs  travel expenses and overhead cost related to these activities 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel engaged in corporate administration  finance  human resources  information systems and legal functions  outside legal and audit expenses  professional fees in connection with complying with the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents  costs associated with being a public company  bad debt expense  other general corporate expenditures  and overhead cost related to these activities 
we account for our investment in ck japan using the equity method of accounting  whereby we record our proportionate share of the income or loss earned by the joint venture 
we record revenue from sales to ck japan as revenue from a related party 
we eliminate our profit associated with inventory we have sold to ck japan that is held by it at the end of the period 
because ck japan uses the japanese yen as its functional currency  we translate the results of operations of ck japan into united states dollars using the average rates of exchange during the reporting periods 
we also record on our balance sheet translation adjustments reflecting the changes in ck japan s equity measured in dollars resulting from changes in exchange rates 
critical accounting policies we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in connection with sales of our lighting systems and oem products when all of the following conditions have been met evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer  typically consisting of a purchase order  our products have been delivered and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which typically occurs when a product is shipped under our customary terms  generally fob shipping point  the amount of revenue to which we are entitled is fixed or determinable  and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect the amount due us from our customer 
to the extent that one or more of these conditions is not present  we delay recognition of revenue until all the conditions are present 
we classify the amount of freight invoiced to the customer as revenue  with the corresponding cost classified as cost of revenues 
we offer our lighting systems customers limited rights of return  which typically provide that within days of shipment products in unopened and saleable condition may  at our discretion  be returned to us for refund  net of a restocking fee 
we also provide certain distributors with limited stock rotation rights 
based on historical experience  we provide for potential returns from customers through a sales return reserve 
the reserve is evaluated and adjusted as conditions warrant 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and we maintain allowances for estimated losses 
this allowance is established using estimates that management makes based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
product warranty 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for one year after sale and provide for estimated future warranty costs at the time revenues are recognized 
warranty expense is based on historical claims experience  repair costs  and current sales levels  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents inventory reserves 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  with market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
we provide reserves equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of our inventory using estimates of their net realizable value that are based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using a liability approach 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  for which we have provided a full valuation allowance  due to our limited operating history and the unlikelihood that we would realize those assets based on that history 
to the extent that we begin to generate significant taxable income  such that it becomes more likely than not that these assets will be recoverable  we will reverse those valuation allowances through income 
to the extent that we are unable to operate profitably  our tax assets could expire unutilized 
the occurrence of certain events  such as significant changes in ownership interests in color kinetics  could result in limitations on the amount of those assets that could be utilized in any given year 
stock based compensation 
we have historically used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation provided to employees and the fair value method to account for stock based compensation to non employees  such as consultants and members of our advisory board 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with awards of stock or stock options is measured as the difference between the price the employee must pay to exercise the award and the fair value of our common stock on the date compensation is measured  which is generally the date of the award 
to date  most awards to employees have had exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of award  and as a result no material compensation charges have been recorded for awards to employees 
under the fair value method  compensation is measured using the estimated fair value of an award  established either through the estimated value of the share of stock or  in the case of options  through the use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes option pricing model 
we disclose the difference between the two methods in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  and those differences have been significant 
in addition  use of an option pricing model invariably involves assumptions about future events  such as the volatility of the underlying stock and the estimated life of an award 
these assumptions are difficult to predict and could generally result in changing levels of compensation expense for these awards in our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first quarter of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
adoption of sfas no 
r will materially increase our stock compensation expense and decrease our net income and basic and diluted earnings per share 
however  adoption of sfas no 
r will have no impact on our financial position 
for the first quarter of  total stock based compensation expense  including amounts from the issuance of stock options using the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  is estimated to be between approximately  and  in order to develop the first quarter stock based compensation expense estimate  we utilized assumptions  including  among other items  projected option grants and expected life and volatility 
sfas no 
r also requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a cash inflow from financing activities rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r beyond the first quarter of cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of total revenues or  in the case of our cost of lighting systems revenues and cost of oem and licensing revenues  as a percentage of the related revenues percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues lighting systems oem and licensing total revenues cost of revenues cost of lighting systems  as a percentage of lighting systems revenues cost of oem and licensing  as a percentage of oem and licensing revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net equity in earnings of joint venture net income loss compared to revenues 
total revenues increased  from million in to million in lighting systems revenues increased  from million in to million in lighting systems revenues in north america increased  from million in to million in  and in markets outside north america increased  from million in to million in the increase in lighting systems revenues for was primarily attributable to increased worldwide sales of our intelligent led lighting systems  the addition of new products to our product line in prior periods  growth in our direct sales force  and our ongoing efforts to expand and support our network of north american manufacturer s representatives and international distributors 
sales in the japanese market to ck japan increased to million in from million in our oem and licensing revenues increased  from million in to million in total oem sales amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in oem sales was primarily attributable to increased product sales to an individual customer in the special event field  which accounted for  of revenues in compared to million of revenues in our licensing revenues amounted to  and million in and  respectively 
the increase in licensing revenues is due primarily to an increase in the base of licensing customers 

table of contents revenues derived from sales of lighting systems and oem products to ck japan represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in and no customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in revenues derived from sales of lighting systems products to ckdi decreased from of total revenues in to of total revenues in we expect lighting systems revenues to increase in  based on our expectation of further increase in worldwide market acceptance of our intelligent led lighting systems  as well as the addition of new products to our product lines 
to accelerate this revenue growth  we have planned a worldwide expansion of our sales force and distribution channels 
we expect total revenues for our oem and licensing business unit to increase in  primarily as a result of having an increasing number of oem and licensing customers who have commenced  or will during commence  commercial shipment of products incorporating our technologies 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased from million in to million in the dollar increase was attributable primarily to increased sales and to overall improved gross margins 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  increased from in to in gross margin from lighting systems increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to reduced product costs 
gross margin from lighting systems may vary from period to period depending on a number of factors  most notably product mix  changes in material costs  and the timing of larger deals which  on average  tend to have lower gross margins 
gross margin from our oem and licensing business increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to increased percentages of higher margin licensing revenues and a favorable change in our product mix toward higher margin oem products 
gross margin for our oem and licensing business may vary in future periods depending on the mix of oem products and the relative percentage of licensing revenues 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and travel related expenses due to an expansion of our sales force and hiring of additional product management personnel  an increase in marketing and channel support programs  and increases in sales commissions to employees and commissions to our manufacturer s representatives as a result of our revenue growth 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in the increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable primarily to the expansion of our sales force and product management team 
in  we expect our payroll related expenses to increase as we add personnel primarily in the area of direct sales and sales support 
in addition  we plan to increase our spending on various variable marketing programs  including branding initiatives  market research  trade shows and events  and marketing publications 
in addition  we expect our commissions to our manufacturer s representatives to increase  commensurate with our expected revenue growth 
as a result  we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in our research and development headcount based both in our boston and china offices  as well as increased spending on product development including testing and certification related activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses remained constant at for each of the years ended and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in dollar amount in subsequent periods  as we devote additional resources to developing new products and technologies and supporting scheduled new product introductions in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in total outside legal expenses in were million  an increase of  compared to  primarily as a result of increased patent application activity and patent litigation matters  as well as corporate projects 
recruiting expenses increased by  in as compared to as a result of fees we incurred to fill certain positions 
outside professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of amounted to  in  compared to in the remaining increase in general and administrative 
table of contents expenses for was primarily the result of increased personnel related costs to support overall growth in the business 
however  the increases in were partially offset by a decrease of  in stock based compensation charges compared to  primarily as a result of accelerating the vesting of previously granted options to advisory board members in june we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount in primarily due to anticipated higher outside legal expenses  principally relating to patent application activity and patent litigation matters 
the timing and extent of patent and litigation activity related to building or defending our intellectual property rights is uncertain  and we expect quarter to quarter variability 
interest income 
interest income increased from  in to million in  due to higher average cash  cash equivalent  and investment balances  as well as higher average yields on these investments in equity in earnings of joint venture 
equity in earnings of joint venture decreased from a  gain in to a  gain in the variance was due to fluctuations in net income earned by ck japan 
the decrease in ck japan s net income in as compared to was primarily attributable to lower gross margin percentages of ck japan in due primarily to programs to expand distribution 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded no provision for income tax in either or due to our net loss carryforward position 
at december   we had net loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of million and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future taxes payable of million 
should it become more likely than not that these assets will be recovered  we would remove the allowances provided  which would have the effect of reducing or eliminating our provision for income tax and possibly creating a tax benefit to earnings 
compared to revenues 
total revenues increased  from million in to million in lighting systems revenues increased  from million in to million in lighting systems revenues in north america increased  from million in to million in  and in markets outside north america increased  from million in to million in the increase in lighting systems revenues for was primarily attributable to increased worldwide sales of our intelligent led lighting systems  the addition of new products to our product line in prior periods  and the continued development of our worldwide sales channels 
these factors more than offset a  decline in lighting systems sales in the japanese market to our joint venture partner  ck japan  compared to in addition  sales of branded consumer products were essentially zero in  compared with approximately million in the decline was a result of our decision in to discontinue selling these as branded color kinetics products and to instead pursue distribution opportunities primarily through our oem and licensing program 
our oem and licensing revenues increased  from million in to million in sales of our oem pool products increased by million to million in sales to oem and licensing customers in other markets increased by million in reflecting  in part  the increase in the number of our oem and licensing customers 
revenues derived from sales of lighting systems and oem products to ck japan decreased from to of total revenues in and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in or revenues derived from sales of lighting systems products to ckdi increased from to of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of our agreement with ckdi beginning in july  therefore resulting in having twelve months of revenues versus six months in and  to a lesser degree  to the overall increase in north american lighting systems revenues 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased from million in to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  increased from in to in the dollar increase was attributable primarily to increased sales and to overall improved gross margins  offset partially by a  
table of contents increase in our provision for warranty related costs in due primarily to estimated costs to replace or repair defective products associated with two isolated product sales in gross margin from lighting systems increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to reduced raw materials and product costs and to an overall more favorable product mix that more than offset the lower margins on our increased sales to ckdi 
gross margin from our oem and licensing business increased from in to in the increase was primarily attributable to increased licensing revenues and other higher margin oem product revenues which more than offset the lower margins on our pool light shipments 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in dollar amount was primarily attributable to a  increase in commissions to our manufacturer s representatives as a result of our revenue growth  as well as a  increase attributable to our having participated in a larger number of trade shows in compared to  and a  increase in product samples and evaluation units 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in the decline in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to our revenue growth 
research and development expenses

stock based compensation charges increased by  in compared to  primarily as a result of accelerating the vesting of previously granted options to advisory board members in june the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily the result of increased personnel related costs to support overall growth in the business as well as expenses related to being a public company 
restructuring expenses 
no restructuring expenses were recorded in the  of restructuring expenses in was attributable to an adjustment made to the restructuring reserve established in  to reflect a change in estimate related to the amount of income we expect to receive from the sublease of our vacated space 
interest income expense  net 
interest income increased from  in to  in  due to higher average cash  cash equivalent  and investment balances  as well as higher average yields on these investments in we incurred  of interest expense in the first half of and none in  as a result of our repayment of all bank debt in equity in earnings of joint venture 
equity in earnings of joint venture increased from  earnings in to  earnings in the lower equity in earnings in was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in  as compared to  on open foreign exchange forward contracts that were purchased by ck japan in order to hedge anticipated dollar denominated purchases 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded no provision for income tax in either or due to our net loss carryforward position 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and equivalents and investments  representing an increase of million compared to our million balance of cash and equivalents and investments at december  during  we generated  of cash from operating activities  as compared to million in the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during as compared to was primarily due to 
table of contents increased inventory purchases in to meet expected demand of certain products  higher accounts receivable balances as a result of revenue growth  and changes in our other operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  reflecting million in net maturities of investments and  from restricted cash representing partial return of a security deposit on our primary office lease 
these inflows were offset partially by million of purchases of property and equipment  primarily tooling and test equipment related to our product development efforts  computers  and leasehold improvements related to the construction of our showroom 
investments are composed of state and municipal obligations  us treasury obligations  and investment grade commercial paper 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  attributable to million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we anticipate that our cash and equivalents and investments at december  will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations we lease certain facilities  including our corporate headquarters  under non cancelable operating lease arrangements expiring through august   with a five year renewal option

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk to which we are subject consists of the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and we have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments  and cash flows are immaterial 
our joint venture  ck japan  has entered into forward currency contracts to hedge anticipated dollar denominated purchases of product from us
