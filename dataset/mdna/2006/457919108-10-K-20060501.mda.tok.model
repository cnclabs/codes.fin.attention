as a result  the information presented above is not comparative from year to year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust is engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
we anticipate that improved economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  will positively impact the operations of the trust in fiscal year better overall economic conditions are expected to result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be strong competition for group business in the markets in which we operate that may affect the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
effective february   the trust relinquished its reit status 
as of that date  any distributions to its shareholders are not deductible for purposes of computing the trust s taxable income and the trust will be subject to income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  without offset for distributions of such income to its shareholders 
as of january   the trust has million in federal net loss carryforward available to offset future federal tax liability 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  and  the trust owned a and  respectively  interest in four of the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
the trust purchased   and  partnership units during the years ended january   and  respectively 
prior to may   the partnership leased its hotel properties to innsuites hotels 
the corresponding rent expense for innsuites hotels and rent revenue for the partnership  as well as the resulting rent receivable and payable  eliminate in consolidation 
on may   the percentage lease agreements between the partnership and innsuites hotels were terminated 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the partnership agreed to waive innsuites hotels accrued but unpaid rent in exchange for innsuites hotels extending its lease agreements one year 
the total amount waived was  this transaction had a net effect of increasing the trust s stockholders equity by  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
occupancy increased to from in the prior year 
adr decreased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in occupancy resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

for the twelve months ended january   the trust had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in total revenue is primarily due to the sale of the tempe and phoenix  arizona and san diego  california properties during the last two fiscal years and decreased occupancy at the ontario  california location due to a conversion of the property to a new brand affiliation 
the negative effects of this brand conversion are not expected to continue in fiscal year total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflect a decrease of approximately million compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease is primarily due to the sales of the tempe and phoenix  arizona and san diego  california properties during the last two fiscal years  reduced depreciation due to a large portion of trust assets reaching the end of their estimated lives  and expenses in the prior year related to the purchase of the management and licensing contracts

after deducting the income allocated to the minority interest of million  taxes of  and the cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle of  the trust had net income attributable to shares of beneficial interest of approximately  this represented an increase of approximately million in net income attributable to shares of beneficial interest comparing the twelve months ended january  and basic and diluted net income per share was for the twelve months ended january   compared to a loss of for liquidity and capital resources overview the trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow and its direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of itself and the partnership to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  which have improved over the prior three fiscal years  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
we anticipate that better overall economic conditions will result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to increased operating income due to better hotel performance 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the disposition of underperforming properties resulting in improved operating results

the decrease in as compared to and was due to fewer dispositions during fiscal year net cash used in financing activities totaled  million  and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the san diego mortgage payoff in fiscal year the increase in as compared to was primarily due to reduced net payments on notes payable to mr 
wirth and his affiliates during fiscal year the trust received million in proceeds from the sales of hotel properties in fiscal year the trust used these proceeds to fund operations and capital improvements 
the trust received million in proceeds for the sales of hotel properties in fiscal year the trust used million of these proceeds to satisfy a mortgage note payable  million to satisfy related party notes and interest payable  and retained the remaining proceeds to reduce trade payables and to fund future operations and capital improvements 
the trust received million in proceeds for the sales of hotel properties in fiscal year the trust used million of these proceeds to satisfy a mortgage note payable  million to satisfy related party notes payable  million to satisfy bank notes payable and the remaining proceeds to fund operations 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
the trust is obligated under loan agreements relating to four of its hotels to deposit of the individual hotel s room revenue into an escrow account to be used for capital expenditures 
these accounts are restricted by the mortgage lenders 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on the trust s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the accounts are required to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the trust plans to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately million during both fiscal years and on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
the trust has minimum debt payments of million and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
the trust plans to renew its bank line of credit when it matures during fiscal year the trust believes it can satisfy its remaining obligations during fiscal years and using revenue generated by the hotels operations 
management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  proceeds from condo hotel conversions and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels or that proceeds from borrowings or issuances of shares of beneficial interest will be available or in amounts and on terms sufficient to allow such transactions 
future positioning the trust s management has identified condo hotel conversions and sales as an opportunity for the trust 
the condo hotel concept has become increasingly popular throughout the country  and may have the potential to eclipse time share or fractional ownership as the preferred vacation  second or third home ownership vehicle 
the trust  through its wholly owned subsidiary  innsuites hotels  is currently pursuing condo hotel ownership primarily for its arizona locations 
in the event this concept proves to be feasible for its current hotel properties  the trust may realize condominium sales revenue and revenue from long term management and trademark agreements with potential homeowners associations and or future condominium owners

 consolidated financial statements 
fin r requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
as of february   the trust recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from its recognition of the  net stockholder s deficit of the management company  which was the trust s variable interest entity under fin r 
the  charge represented the net effect of the trust reporting  in net assets consisting primarily of receivables and  in net liabilities consisting primarily of debt upon consolidating the financial results of the management company 
all revenue and expense items for the management company and licensing corp 
relating to services provided to the hotels were eliminated when their financial results were consolidated with the trust s results

is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on trust s financial position or results of operations 
inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and innsuites hotels in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flow and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fiscal debt type thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt interest rate available on january  the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during any particular period and future interest rates
