chindex international  inc is a delaware corporation with headquarters located in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
we were founded in and currently are an american provider of healthcare services and products to china  including hong kong 
in order to improve our financial performance  in november  the company determined that the retail operations of our former healthcare products distribution division  which had suffered continuing losses over a nine year period  would be closed 
the close down of the retail business  which distributed health and personal care products to the consumer markets in china through retail pharmacies  was substantially completed by the end of fiscal the distribution and logistics services  which had been part of the discontinued division  have been migrated to the parent company 
the distribution of medical products that had been conducted in the former healthcare products distribution division are now conducted by the medical products division 
the operating results related to the closedown of this business have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations on a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we now operate in two business segments healthcare services division 
this division operates the company s private hospitals and clinics 
beijing united family hospital and clinics bju opened in and shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu opened in in  we opened our first satellite clinic associated with bju in shunyi county outside of beijing 
in a second clinic was opened in downtown beijing 
we have also established a satellite clinic associated with shu 
we are the only foreign invested  multi facility hospital network in china 
for fiscal  the healthcare services division accounted for of the company s revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
medical products division 
this division  formerly named the medical capital equipment division  markets  distributes and sells select medical capital equipment  instrumentation and other medical products for use in hospitals in china and hong kong on the basis of both exclusive and non exclusive agreements with the manufacturers of these products 
chindex believes based on its knowledge and experience in the chinese healthcare system  that it is the largest independent us distributor of imported healthcare equipment in china 
for fiscal  the medical products division accounted for of our revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
substantially all of our assets are located in china and substantially all our revenues are derived from our operations in china 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject  to a significant degree  to economic  political and legal developments in china 
the economic system in china differs from the economics of most developed countries in many respects  including government investment  level of development  control of capital investment  control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources 
our healthcare services division is subject to challenges and risks associated with operating in china  including the laws  policies and regulations of the chinese government concerning healthcare facilities and dependence upon the healthcare professionals staffing our hospital facilities 
our operating results vary from period to period as a result of a variety of social and epidemiological factors in the patient base served by our hospital network 
our medical products division is subject to challenges and risks as a result of our dependence on our relations with suppliers of equipment and products 
in addition  the timing of our revenue from the sale of medical capital equipment is affected by the availability of funds to customers in the budgeting processes of those customers  the availability of credit from the chinese banking system and otherwise 
consequently  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition  receivable collectibility  income tax recognition of deferred tax items and inventories 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue related to services provided in our healthcare services segment is recognized in the period services are provided 
revenue includes an estimate of services at the end of the period for patients who have not completed service 
costs associated with such services are recognized in the period incurred 
revenue related to the sale of medical equipment  instrumentation and products in our medical products division is recognized upon product shipment 
we provide installation  warranty  and training services for certain of our capital equipment and instrumentation sales 
these services are viewed as perfunctory to the overall arrangement and are not accounted for separately from the equipment sale 
costs associated with installation  after sale servicing and warranty are not significant and are recognized in cost of sales as they are incurred 
the estimated cost for training services is accrued upon shipment 
receivable collectibility we grant credit to some customers in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable periodically and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
bad debts are experienced predominately in the healthcare services division and to a lesser extent in the medical products division 
we recognized bad debt expense in healthcare services division of   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively and  in the medical products division only for the year ended march  we increased the consolidated reserve for doubtful accounts from  at march  to  at march  as the result of routine accruals in the healthcare services division 
valuation allowance of deferred tax assets our operations are taxed in various jurisdictions including the united states and china 
in certain jurisdictions individual subsidiaries are taxed separately 
we have identified deferred tax assets resulting from cumulative temporary differences at each balance sheet date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
we have provided substantial deferred tax valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets related to various subsidiaries in china and the us in the year ended march  because we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized 
we released deferred tax valuation allowances totaling  in the year ended march  based on our assessment that it was more likely than not that we would be able to use our china and us net operating loss carryforwards 
the us net operating loss carryforwards do not expire before and the china net operating loss carryforwards do not expire before inventories inventories are priced using standard costs  which approximate first in  first out  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
allowances and write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand and salability 
these adjustments are charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
due to the impact of a suppliers end of service support for certain products  we recognized a  writedown of obsolete spare parts inventories during fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  our revenue for fiscal was  up from fiscal revenue of  we experienced continued revenue growth in the healthcare services division of  as compared to the prior period 
we experienced a decrease in revenue over the prior period in our medical products division 
costs and expenses were  for fiscal as compared with costs and expenses of  for fiscal additionally  the change in the exchange rate of the renminbi to the us dollar  announced by the chinese government in july  resulted in a foreign exchange gain of  in the period see foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation 
we recorded income from continuing operations of  for fiscal  as compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for fiscal the increased costs in each division are discussed below 
in addition  there were a number of increased costs at the parent level of the company  including increased costs for corporate governance  such as sarbanes oxley compliance and in particular preparation for compliance with section thereof for which a great deal of work was completed during the year 
the parent level costs have been allocated among the divisions as described below 
the largest parent level increases include increased payroll of  and increased professional fees of  both substantially related to compliance and corporate reporting  and increased audit fees of  our business operations in fiscal will continue to focus on cost reduction programs at the corporate level and cost containment programs at the operating division level 
in the healthcare services division we expect continued revenue growth and profitability in hospital operations in both the beijing and shanghai markets 
our development programs will focus on strategic geographic expansion of clinic operations in shanghai  increased patient services throughout the ufh network and assessing potentials and financing options for the next phases of expansion 
in the medical products division we expect a return to historical levels of growth and profitability as the market and product issues impacting our period are relieved 
our development programs will focus on expanding distribution channels  increasing market penetration and broadening product offerings 
healthcare services division the healthcare services division operates our network of private healthcare facilities in china 
during fiscal  the division consisted of a network of united family hospitals and clinics ufh in beijing and shanghai 
in beijing  the ufh network included beijing united family hospital and clinics bju  and two affiliated satellite clinics 
in shanghai  the ufh network included shanghai united family hospital and clinics shu and one affiliated clinic 
for fiscal  the revenue from the division was  an increase of over fiscal revenue of  the increased revenue is attributable in part to the first full fiscal year of operations of ufh facilities in the shanghai market  as well as revenue growth of in the beijing market during the recent period as compared to the prior period 
healthcare services operating costs increased for fiscal  to  a increase over the prior period s operating costs of  salaries increased by  salaries were and of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to the costs associated with the opening of the ufh facilities in the shanghai market  increased services offered in beijing  and the period of preparation for joint commission international jci accreditation at the bju facilities 
other costs increased  primarily due to increases in direct patient care expenses  excise taxes  depreciation and an increase to the division s allocated portion of parent level administrative costs 
the healthcare services division had income from operations of  in fiscal  compared with a loss from operations of  which included  of development expenses related to the opening of the shanghai market facilities in the prior period 
during fiscal  bju and shu obtained approximately million in funding from the international finance corporation 
these funds were used to retire bank debt for these entities and will also be used to fund a portion of their future capital growth programs see liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  during the year we announced the successful jci accreditation of the bju network operations 
our ufh network in beijing is the only healthcare network to have received that accreditation in asia 
in fiscal in the healthcare services division we expect continued revenue growth and profitability in hospital operations in both the beijing and shanghai markets 
our ufh operations in beijing will focus on revenue growth through increased patient services in our existing facilities 
our ufh operations in shanghai will focus on revenue growth through geographic expansion into the pudong district as well as increased patient services 
we are also assessing future development projects in both hospital development and hospital management in several key geographic areas of china outside our existing markets 
medical products division the medical products division  formerly named the medical capital equipment division  markets  distributes and sells select medical capital equipment  instrumentation and other medical products for use in hospitals in china and hong kong on the basis of both exclusive and non exclusive agreements with the manufacturers of these products 
in fiscal  this division had revenue of  a decrease from revenue of  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to lackluster sales in certain product categories due to maturing product life cycle issues  increased competition in certain mid tier product markets  delays due to increasing requirements for public tendering in capital equipment markets see timing of revenue  delays in product registrations in other product categories and a general slowdown in the growth rate of the market for imported medical devices in china in the first half of the year 
this was offset by final delivery of goods in the third quarter under a government backed financing program 
we continued to focus on cost containment throughout the year and released new premium and mid tier market products during the fourth quarter 
in addition  the product registration process was completed during the second half of the year for another line of products which allowed sales to proceed 
gross profit for the medical products division in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the medical products division increased to during the current period from during the previous period 
during fiscal we recognized  positive impact to gross profit percentage in additional gross profit due to a reduction in estimates of our training obligations 
the training obligations have been declining over the years and the reduction in estimates represented a one time elimination of a number of older obligations that are unlikely to occur 
we now report these costs when actually incurred in addition  we recognized  negative impact to gross profit percentage in reduced gross profit for the writedown of certain spare parts inventories which had become obsolete 
the adjustment during the year was due to the impact of our suppliers end of service support for certain product platforms 
in addition  we recognized  a less than positive impact to gross profit percentage in additional gross profit due to the reduction in accruals of estimates of certain future costs 
actual expenditures related to this cost estimate have been declining over the years 
we have reduced our estimate of this cost to reflect normal spending 
expenses for the medical products division in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal and  as a percentage of revenue over the periods  increased to from 
salaries for the segment increased by  in the recent period and were offset by a  decrease in accrued compensation to reflect lower than estimated commissions payable  resulting in a net increase of  over the prior period 
other costs for the segment decreased  over the periods  primarily due to decreased allocated parent level administration costs and a greater allowance for doubtful accounts expense recorded in the prior period  offset by increased travel and entertainment expenses 
the division had a loss from operations of  in the recent period  compared with a loss from operations of  in the prior period 
in fiscal in the medical products division we expect a return to historical levels of growth and profitability as the market and product issues impacting our period are relieved 
we also expect increased requirements for public tendering in certain products in capital equipment markets 
the business will focus on nationwide roll out of the new premium and mid tier market products launched in late fiscal in addition there will be introduction of products with new technologies in both the mainland china and hong kong markets 
instrumentation and off the shelf product categories are expected to expand market penetration primarily through continued geographic growth of the channels distribution network 
in addition  the division expects to deliver previously awarded contracts under government backed financing programs for medical equipment and has an aggressive development program pursuing future such programs 
other income and expenses interest expense incurred on short term capitalized leases of  short term debt of  long term capitalized leases of  and long term debt of  amounted to  compared to  in the prior period 
interest expense of  in the prior period is net of  of capitalized interest 
the long term debt is for the development and expansion of united family hospital and clinics see liquidity and capital resources 
taxes we recorded a  benefit from taxes in fiscal as compared to a benefit for taxes of  for fiscal our gross deferred tax asset increased by  we also recorded an additional valuation allowance of  that relates primarily to the china operations 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the conclusion that the realization of the tax benefit is currently unknown for certain china operations 
the remaining tax benefit of  was recorded for the us operations and shu operations 
this tax computation is in accordance with current accounting standards but assumes a certain level of future profitability 
we believe the recognition of the additional  in deferred tax assets properly recognizes the benefits we have achieved as a result of our tax restructuring and expect to utilize a substantial portion of the loss carry forward benefit in fiscal years and we have provided a valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to losses incurred for certain china operations other than shu  since these operations have no operating history to support a conclusion that realization of the tax benefit is more likely than not 
discontinued operations in november of fiscal  the company determined that the retail business operated by the healthcare products distribution division would be discontinued

development costs related to shu were  for the nine month period  an increase from  in fiscal for fiscal  the revenue from the division was  an increase of over fiscal revenue of  the increased revenues were primarily attributable to growth in patient volumes partially due to increased services in the beijing market and to a lesser degree the opening of the new facility in shanghai

in fiscal  this division had revenue of  a increase over revenue of  in fiscal the revenue increase reflects the continued development of and revenue from new sales channels for our capital medical equipment  involving greater use of local chinese sub distributors  as well as the fact that sars was a significant negative factor in the prior year 
finally  the addition of a new range of medium priced ultrasound products targeting the mid tier market enabled us to penetrate new market divisions  thus helping to increase sales

a portion of the proceeds from this funding was used to retire all debt previously owing to hsbc under standard commercial terms 
in addition  the proceeds will be used to fund a portion of bju s and shu s capital growth programs 
chindex international guaranteed repayment of this loan in the full amount of the indebtedness should the borrowers default as defined in the loan agreement 
in terms of security  ifc has  among other things  a lien over the equipment owned by the borrowers and over their bank accounts 
in addition  ifc has a lien over chindex bank accounts not already pledged  but not over other chindex assets 
as of march   the outstanding balance of this debt was  and was classified as long term 
on june   a building contractor brought a lawsuit in china against shu claiming certain amounts due in connection with the original construction of the facility 
as permitted under chinese law  the contractor also unilaterally obtained a lien in the amount of million rmb million on the current assets of shu

the borrowings under that credit facility bear interest at over the three month london interbank offered rate libor 
balances outstanding under the facilities are payable on demand  fully secured and collateralized by government securities acceptable to the bank having an aggregate fair market value of not less than  in addition  we have opened a  euro performance bond in connection with the execution of a kfw development bank funded contract 
this bond is fully secured and collateralized by cash deposits on hand at our german subsidiary 
these cash deposits are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have an agreement with a major vendor whereby the vendor has agreed to provide up to  of long term one and one half years on those transactions that have occurred to date payment terms on our purchase of certain medical equipment from the vendor under government backed financing program contracts 
the arrangement carries an interest component of five percent 
at march   and march   the company has short term debt of  and  respectively  outstanding under this agreement 
over the next twelve months we anticipate capital expenditures of million 
our healthcare services division intends to finance its capital expenditures for expansion projects and hospital information systems development principally through the debt financing program with ifc  limited short term vendor financing arrangements  as well as cash flows from operations 
our medical products division intends to finance any capital expenditures for growth projects under the vendor financing arrangement discussed above and from cash flows from operations 
in addition we intend to finance certain corporate expenditures for information systems development through cash flows from operations and additional bank loans  to the extent available 
there can be no assurances that the foregoing sources will be sufficient to finance in whole or in part any proposed capital expenditures 
we continue to pursue other financing strategies to support our future expansion  capital improvements  requirements for bonds in the medical capital equipment segment and equipment requirements 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to curtail or terminate certain operations  which could have a material adverse affect on results of operations and prospects 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of march  thousands total thereafter line of credit bank loan vendor financing capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations includes interest of  for information about these contractual obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
timing of revenue the timing of our revenue is affected by several factors 
in the healthcare services division  our revenue is predictable  however it is dependent on seasonal fluctuations related to epidemiology factors and the life styles of the expatriate community 
for example  many expatriate families traditionally take annual home leave outside of china during the summer months 
in the medical products division  sales of capital equipment often require protracted sales efforts  long lead times  financing arrangements and other time consuming steps 
for example  many end users are required to purchase capital equipment through a formal public tendering process  which often entails an extended period of time before the sale can be completed 
further  in light of the dependence by purchasers of capital equipment on the availability of credit  the timing of sales may depend upon the timing of our or our purchasers abilities to arrange for credit sources  including loans from local chinese banks or financing from international loan programs such as those offered by the us export import bank and the german kfw development bank 
in addition  a relatively limited number of orders and shipments may constitute a meaningful percentage of our revenue in any one period 
as a result of these factors impacting the timing of revenues  our operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary from period to period and year to year 
foreign currency exchange and impact of inflation since we receive approximately of our revenue in local chinese currency  we have some foreign currency risk 
on july   the chinese government removed the peg of the rmb to the usd allowing it to float in a narrow band against a basket of international currencies 
this immediately revalued the rmb to the rate of us or a rate change of 
subsequent strengthening of the rmb has resulted in an exchange rate of us or a rate change of as of march  during fiscal  we had exchange gains of  which amounts are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
our sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of the rmb to the usd at march   indicated that if the usd uniformly increased in value by percent relative to the rmb  then we would have experienced an smaller loss 
conversely  a percent increase in the value of the rmb relative to the usd at march   would have resulted in a additional loss 
we also have purchased and will continue to purchase some products in freely transferable western currencies other than usd and have sold and will continue to sell such products in china for usd 
to the extent that the value of the usd declines against such a currency  we could experience a negative impact on profitability 
if the chinese government decides to adjust the value of the rmb so that it increases in value as against the usd  we may respond with adjustments to our operating processes so as to improve the benefit to the company of such a change 
for example  we could increase the proportion of medical capital equipment that we sell in rmb instead of in usd 
moreover  our us sourced products would be cheaper for our customers  thus improving our competitive position vis vis products from some other countries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its market risk exposures are immaterial as the company does not have instruments for trading purposes  and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings  material changes in fair values or cash flows for all instruments
