item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment advisory and management fees the company s exposure to market risk is directly related to its role as an investment adviser for the mutual funds and separate accounts the company manages 
the revenues earned under these agreements are typically based on the market value of aum 
aum can be affected by changes in interest rates  fluctuations in financial markets  and fluctuations in foreign currency 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities may cause the company s revenue to decline by causing the value of aum to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and management fees 
causing the company s clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater reward or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and management fees 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  including instruments which earn interest over short periods of time days  are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates  which impacts interest income 
the company maintains its cash in institutions which have superior credit ratings and it consistently monitors the quality of the institution where its cash is deposited 
presently  the company neither participates in hedging activities nor does it have any derivative financial instruments
