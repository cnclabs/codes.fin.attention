this resulted in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses of million and reduction in the allowance for loan losses to total loans from percent to percent at june  management evaluates the degree of loss exposure for loans on a continuous basis through a formal allowance for loan loss policy as administered by the loan administration department of s t bank and various management and director committees 
problem loans are identified and continually monitored through detailed reviews of specific commercial loans  and the analysis of delinquency and charge off levels of consumer loan portfolios 
charged off and recovered loan amounts are applied to the allowance for loan losses 
monthly updates are presented to the s t board of directors as to the status of loan quality 
amounts are added to the allowance for loan losses through a charge to current earnings through the provision for loan losses  based upon management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for probable loan losses 
a quantitative analysis is utilized to support the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis includes review of the historical charge off rates for all loan categories  fluctuations and trends in various risk factors 
factors consider the level of s t s historical charge offs that have occurred within the credits economic life cycle 
management also assesses qualitative factors such as portfolio credit trends  unemployment trends  vacancy trends  loan growth and variable interest rate factors 
significant to this analysis and assessment is the shift in loan portfolio composition to an increased mix of commercial loans 
these loans are generally larger in size and  due to our continuing growth  many are not well seasoned and could be more vulnerable to an economic slowdown 
management relies on its risk rating process to monitor trends  which may be occurring relative to commercial loans to assess potential weaknesses within specific credits 
current risk factors  trends in risk ratings and historical charge off experiences are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the risk rating profile of the portfolio remained relatively stable 
management believes its quantitative and qualitative analysis and risk rating process is sufficient and enables it to conclude that the total allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s assessment of the factors noted above along with the growth in the loan portfolio 
the additions to the allowance charged to operating expense has maintained the allowance as a percent of loans at the following levels at the end of each year presented below year ended december we have considered impaired loans in our determination of the allowance for loan losses

explanation of use of non gaap financial measures in addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  s t management uses  and this annual report contains or references  certain non gaap financial measures  such as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and operating revenue 
s t believes these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and our business and performance trends as they facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the financial page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued services industry 
although s t believes that these non gaap financial measures enhance investors understanding of s t s business and performance  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap 
we believe the presentation of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice 
interest income per the consolidated statements of income is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis on page operating revenue is the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less security gains 
in order to understand the significance of net interest income to s t business and operating results  s t management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the significance of net interest income as a component of operating revenue 
results of operations year ended december  net income net income was a record million or per diluted earnings per share in  a percent increase from the million or per diluted earnings per share in the increase in earnings was primarily the result of increases in net interest income and noninterest income offset by lower security gains and increased noninterest expense

page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued positively affecting net interest income was a million increase in average net free funds during compared to average net free funds are the excess of demand deposits  other noninterest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity over nonearning assets 
most of this increase is due to the successful marketing of new demand accounts and corporate cash management services 
net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest yields and rates 
therefore  maintaining consistent spreads between earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is very significant to our financial performance because net interest income comprised percent of operating revenue  net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding security gains in and percent in the level and mix of earning assets and funds are continually monitored by alco in order to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risks of the balance sheet 
a variety of alco strategies were successfully implemented  within prescribed alco risk parameters that enabled us to maintain a net interest margin consistent with historical levels 
interest on loans to and obligations of state  municipalities and other public entities is not subject to federal income tax 
as such  the stated pre tax yield on these assets is lower than the yields on taxable assets of similar risk and maturity 
in order to make the pre tax income and resultant yields comparable to taxable loans and investments  a tax equivalent adjustment was added to interest income in the tables below 
this adjustment has been calculated using the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate of percent for  and the following table reconciles interest income per the consolidated statements of income to net interest income adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis year ended december dollars in thousands interest income per consolidated statements of income adjustment to fully tax equivalent basis interest income adjusted to fully tax equivalent basis interest expense net interest income adjusted to fully tax equivalent basis page

no comments were received from the federal reserve bank of cleveland that would have a material effect on s t s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
s t s current capital position and results of regulatory examination allow it to pay the lowest possible rate for fdic deposit insurance 
critical accounting policies and judgments we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these policies are described in note a accounting policies 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect s t s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on s t s future financial condition and results of operations 
securities securities are reported at cost adjusted for premiums and discounts and are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity 
declines in market value of individual securities below their amortized cost  and that are other than temporary  will be written down to current market value and included in earnings as realized losses 
management systematically evaluates securities for other than temporary declines in market value on a quarterly basis 
if the financial markets experience deterioration  additional charges to income could occur in future periods 
allowance for loan losses determination of an adequate allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective  as it requires estimations of occurrence of future events as well as timing of such events 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
s t s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined by management through evaluation of the loss exposure on individual nonperforming  delinquent and high dollar loans  review of risk conditions and business trends  historical loss experience  and growth and composition of the loan portfolio  as well as other relevant factors 
page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a quantitative analysis is utilized to support the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis includes review of the historical charge offs that have occurrence within the credits economic life cycle 
management also assesses qualitative factors such as portfolio credit trends  unemployment trends  vacancy trends  loan growth and variable interest rate factors 
significant to this analysis is the shift in loan portfolio composition to an increased mix of commercial loans 
these loans are generally larger in size  and  due to our continuing growth  many are unsecured or new loan relationships 
management relies on its risk rating process to monitor trends that may be occurring relative to commercial loans to assess potential weaknesses within the credit 
current risk factors and trends in risk ratings are considered in the determination and allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the risk rating profile of the portfolio remained relatively stable 
the allowance for loan losses at december  includes million or percent of the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans 
the ability for customers to repay commercial loans is more dependent upon the success of their business  continuing income and general economic conditions 
accordingly  the risk of loss is higher on such loans than on residential real estate loans  which generally incur lower losses in the event of foreclosure as the collateral value typically exceeds the loan amounts 
goodwill and other intangible assets s t has million of core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization and million in goodwill  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
s t determined the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent core deposit analysis and insurance contract analysis 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
s t s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon s t s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of s t s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment is performed by s t 
the market value of s t and the implied market value of goodwill at the respective reporting unit level are estimated using industry comparable information 
s t has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as a result of the evaluation as of september  inflation management is aware of the significant effect inflation has on interest rates and can have on financial performance 
s t s ability to cope with this is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing interest rates and its ability to manage noninterest income and expense 
s t monitors its mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation by reviewing the prices of its products and services  by introducing new products and services and by controlling overhead expenses 
business uncertainties there are many uncertainties regarding the economy as we enter s t continually strives to be well positioned for changes in both the economy and interest rates  regardless of the timing or page 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued direction of these changes 
we continually assess our balance sheet  capital  liquidity and operation infrastructures in order to be positioned to take advantage of internal or acquisition growth opportunities 
there are many factors that could influence our results  both positively and negatively  in because the majority of our revenue comes from net interest income  internally generated loan and deposit growth and the mix of that growth are major factors on our operations and financial condition 
s t has directed a fair amount of focus and resources in planning for to improve our generation and retention of low cost core deposits 
on the other hand  a slowing economy could cause deterioration in the asset quality measurements 
we recognize that our shift to a greater dependence on commercial loans in recent years exposes us to larger credit risks and greater swings in nonperforming loans and charge offs when problems do occur 
however  because of our earnings strength and strong capitalization  as well as the strengths of other businesses in our market area  management does not expect a decline in our ability to satisfactorily perform if a further decline in our economy occurs

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity refers to the ability to satisfy the financial needs of depositors who want to withdraw funds  or of borrowers needing access to funds to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the asset liability committee alco is responsible for establishing and monitoring the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity guidelines  procedures and policies 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest earning deposits with banks  federal funds  investment securities that mature in one year or less and securities available for sale 
at december   the total of such assets was approximately million or percent of consolidated assets 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is further enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions and s t s ability to renew maturing deposits 
certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more represented percent of deposits at december  and were outstanding primarily to local customers 
s t s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
beyond the issue of having sufficient sources to fund unexpected credit demands or deposit withdrawals  liquidity management also is an important factor in monitoring and managing interest rate sensitivity issues through alco 
through forecast and simulation models  alco is also able to project future funding needs and develop strategies for acquiring funds at a reasonable cost 
alco uses a variety of measurements to monitor the liquidity position of s t 
these include liquidity gap  liquidity forecast  net loans and standby letters of credit to assets  net loans to deposits and net non core funding dependence ratio 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because the assets and liabilities of s t are primarily monetary in nature  the presentation and analysis of cash flows in formats prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are less meaningful for managing bank liquidity than for non financial companies

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued repayments  deposits and borrowings 
the primary uses of funds include new loans  repayment of borrowings  the purchase of securities and dividends to shareholders 
the level and mix of sources and uses of funds are constantly monitored and adjusted by alco in order to maintain credit  liquidity and interest rate risks within prescribed policy guidelines while maximizing earnings 
alco monitors and manages interest rate sensitivity through gap  rate shock analysis and simulations in order to avoid unacceptable earnings fluctuations due to interest rate changes 
s t s gap model includes certain management assumptions based upon past experience and the expected behavior of customers 
the assumptions include principal prepayments for fixed rate loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and classifying the demand  savings and money market balances by degree of interest rate sensitivity 
the gap and cumulative gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods  as measured by a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities 
the gap analysis below incorporates a flat rate scenario  and the following significant assumptions monthly loan prepayments above contractual requirements year arm commercial real estate year arm commercial real estate fixed rate commercial real estate residential real estate fixed rate home equity other installment loans deposit behavioral pattern decay rate assumptions now and savings year now and savings year now and savings beyond year green plan savings months money market months s t has not historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand deposit balances during periods of interest rate fluctuations

this means that more liabilities than assets will reprice during the measured time frames 
the implications of a liability sensitive position will differ depending upon the change in market interest rates 
for example  with a liability sensitive position in a declining interest rate environment  more liabilities than assets will decrease in rate 
this situation could result in an increase to our interest rate spreads and net interest income 
conversely  with a liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment  more liabilities than assets will increase in rates 
this situation could result in a decrease to our interest rate spreads and net interest income 
during s t changed from being asset sensitive to slightly liability sensitive as measured by gap 
the most important cause of this is the increase in short term rates and the flattening of the yield curve 
this makes short term deposits and long term loans more attractive to customers  both of which make balance sheets more liability sensitive 
the shortening of deposits was seen in certificates of deposit  but was particularly evident in the success of the green plan  s t s new savings account that is indexed to the federal funds target rate 
in addition to the gap analysis  s t performs a rate shock analysis to estimate the effect that specific interest rate changes would have on months of pretax net interest income 
the rate shock incorporates management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate changes on non maturity page 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued deposit products savings  money market  now and demand deposits and changes in the prepayment behavior of fixed rate loans and securities with optionality 
inclusion of these assumptions makes rate shock analysis more useful than gap analysis alone 
the table below shows the results of the rate shock analyses 
immediate change in rates change in pretax net interest income bps bps dollars in millions december  december  consistent with our asset sensitive gap position in  the rate shock analysis results showed net interest income increased in rates up and decreased in rates down 
however  with a slightly liability sensitive gap position in  the rate shock analysis results were not consistent with gap in rates down  since gap would indicate an increase in net interest income 
the primary reasons for this are  rates on regular savings  now and money market accounts have lagged as short rates have increased and cannot be decreased to any great extent should rates go down  loan prepayments will be considerable in rates down  which is not captured by gap analysis assuming flat rates  the rate shock analysis does not include growth assumptions  which previously improved results in both rates up and down  and the increased uncertainty of modeling customer behavior in an interest rate environment that includes a generally flat yield curve with some inversions longer term rates lower than short term rates
