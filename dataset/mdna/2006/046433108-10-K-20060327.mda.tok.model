item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the liquidity section in this report 
competitive conditions astronics experiences considerable competition in the aerospace market sectors we serve  principally with respect to product performance and price  from various competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources 
success in the aerospace markets we serve depends upon product innovation  customer support  responsiveness  and cost management 
astronics continues to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our aerospace markets 
government contracts all us government contracts  including subcontracts where the us government is the ultimate customer  may be subject to termination at the election of the government

item a 
risk factors risks related to our industry the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles and domestic and foreign economic conditions and events 
for example  demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product innovations  economic growth  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes and economic conditions 
these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel 
a reduction in air travel would reduce orders for new aircraft for which we supply products and for the sales of spare parts  thus reducing our sales 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all 
we depend heavily on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors that may not be fully funded or may be terminated  and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts 
the nature of our business activities involves fixed price contracts 
our contractual arrangements include customers requirements for delivery of hardware and funded nonrecurring development work that we anticipate will lead to follow on production orders 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented of our sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business we operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess  which could reduce the volume of products we can sell and our operating margins 
many of our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services  or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
our future growth and continued success is dependent on our key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located in the united states and canada 
any of these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
