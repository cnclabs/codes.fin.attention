item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   our income before income taxes was million  compared to income of million before income taxes and extraordinary gain for  a increase 
net sales for increased over to million 
this continued growth in our business is a result of our strategy to provide our customers with the best product and the best service at the best price 
net income was million or per fully diluted share 
net income includes a million tax benefit for the elimination of the valuation allowance 
now that aert has been profitable from operations for the past two years and expects to be profitable in the future  we removed the valuation allowance we had provided for our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter and recognized a net million non cash income tax benefit  which significantly increased net income for the quarter and year 
the deferred tax asset is comprised of net operating losses nols accumulated in the company s developmental years 
in future periods  aert will apply a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of approximately to pre tax income  even though the taxes recorded will be primarily non cash charges 
we will continue to use the nols to reduce actual income tax payments  which will benefit our cash flow 
sales growth in was driven by continued strong demand for all three of our product lines and enabled by higher factory output resulting from increased productivity and price increases 
in order to meet expected future demand  we are building a third extrusion factory and expanding our plastic recycling facilities  which resulted in a total capital investment of million during we plan to continue to increase our production capacity in step with growing demand for our products 
as industry wide sales of composite decking increases  it is likely that the annual rate of sales growth will decelerate 
our gross profit margin improved to in from in volatility in worldwide pricing of polyethylene the largest component of our raw material costs continues to present a challenge as we reach for higher and more stable margins 
we believe polyethylene prices will continue to be unstable and so we are focused on further developing our capability to use types of polyethylene waste that are in abundant supply and low demand 
our operating margin improved to of net sales in from of net sales in due to our improved gross margin and because we were able to increase sales at a faster rate than we increased our overhead costs  which we expect to continue 
general and administrative costs for included substantial legal expenses  and we also took a one time net charge in the fourth quarter of of  as a reserve against a recent jury award in a contract dispute with a former supplier 
we generated million of cash flow from operations in versus million in  a increase 
cash used for capital improvements was approximately million  cash used in financing activities was  primarily to reduce debt  and we increased our cash balance by  at december   our current ratio was and our long term debt to equity ratio was 
that compares to and  respectively  at december  we believe that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to pay our operating costs and fixed obligations for and into the future 
for and beyond we are focused on adding production capacity and improving manufacturing efficiencies 
for example  we are investing heavily in in house plastic recycling capacity and advanced recycling technologies  we expect to start one production line at our new springdale south extrusion facility in the second quarter of and plan to add a second line in early  with two more lines for a total of four anticipated by the end of we are continually evaluating  improving and implementing manufacturing efficiencies  we continue to aggressively recruit new aert associates for senior and middle management levels 
we continue to build brand recognition and our company s reputation with the quality of our products and customer service 

table of contents we believe the selected sales data  the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the statements of operations and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations 
we operate in one business segment and believe the information presented in our management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition provides an understanding of our business segment  our operations and our financial condition 
results of operations three year comparison change change net sales cost of goods sold of net sales gross margin of net sales selling and administrative costs of net sales research and development subtotal of net sales operating income of net sales other income expense insurance proceeds related to lost income net litigation contingency loss on disposition of equipment net interest expense income loss before extraordinary item accrued premium on preferred stock and taxes of net sales accrued premium on preferred stock income loss before extraordinary item and taxes of net sales net income tax benefit of net sales income loss before extraordinary item of net sales extraordinary gain on involuntary conversion of non monetary assets due to fire net income applicable to common stock of net sales 
table of contents net sales change change springdale facility junction facility total net sales year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  grew compared to our challenge  as in recent prior years  was to make enough of our products to satisfy customer demand 
approximately of the sales gain was the result of productivity increases at our plastic recycling and extrusion plants  with the balance attributable to price increases 
we have recently increased prices of our products by an average of versus the average price prevailing in cost of goods sold and gross margin cost of goods sold  as a percent of sales  decreased to for the year ended december  from for labor costs and manufacturing overhead were down  as a percent of sales  due to increased automation and efficiency initiatives 
our manufacturing improvement programs also resulted in higher output per manufacturing line in versus  thus reducing overhead costs as a percent of sales 
material costs  however  were up significantly due to higher costs of polyethylene scrap prices resulting from instability in world petroleum and natural gas markets and disruptions in the supply of polyethylene resulting from hurricane damage along the gulf coast in august and september 
our strategy for managing raw material costs is to expand our internal plastic processing capacity and to seek new sources of lower cost waste plastic materials 
we are also focused on better material handling techniques and efficiencies to further reduce manufacturing waste and handling costs 
volatility of raw material costs continues to be one of our greatest challenges and sustained upward price movement of our raw materials has an adverse effect on our profitability 
gross profit margin improved to for from in as efficiency gains and price increases outweighed the effects of higher raw material costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs increased in compared to as a result of increases in sales  customer service  and corporate personnel expenses  along with general increases in corporate costs to manage our growing business 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative costs decreased to in compared to in the categories of salaries and benefits  professional fees  advertising and promotion  travel and entertainment  and commissions together make up of total selling and administrative expenses 
professional fees included substantial legal expenses see item legal proceedings 
we expect to continue to grow sales at a faster rate than overhead expenses in operating income operating income was of net sales for versus of net sales for operating income was negatively impacted by a one time litigation loss charge of  in the fourth quarter of pertaining to a recent jury award in a contract dispute with a former supplier see item legal proceedings 
net income we removed the valuation allowance we had provided for our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter and recognized a net million non cash income tax benefit  which significantly increased net income for the quarter and year 
the deferred tax asset is comprised of net operating losses nols accumulated during 
table of contents aert s developmental years 
in future periods  we will apply a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of approximately to pre tax income  even though the taxes recorded will be primarily non cash charges 
we will continue to use the nols to reduce actual income tax payments  which will benefit our cash flow 
net income increased to  in from  in income before income taxes for was  up substantially from income of  in continued profitable operations depends on  among other things  our ability to manage raw material costs and to grow our sales faster than our overhead expenses see item a 
risk factors we may be unable to secure an adequate quantity and quality of raw materials at economical prices 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  grew compared to due to a product mix that included a higher percentage of value added products  including the new choicedek premium embossed  which accounted for of the increase  restoration of the junction plant to its pre fire capacity  which accounted for of the increase  and increased productivity  which resulted from various capital projects that increased output and reduced manufacturing waste 
productivity gains account for the remaining of the increase 
in  demand for our products exceeded our manufacturing capacity 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased in versus cost of goods sold is directly related to sales  which increased 
cost of goods sold as a percent of sales thus decreased from of sales to of sales  which raised our gross margin from to 
all three accounting components of cost of goods sold cost of materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead decreased as a percent of sales 
direct labor costs decreased as a result of automation projects and from more emphasis on training and productivity improvement programs 
manufacturing overhead decreased as we increased output at a faster rate than we increased overhead spending 
the cost of materials in was lower  as a percent of sales  than in because we expanded our plastic processing capacity at the lowell  arkansas and alexandria  louisiana facilities and sought new sources of lower cost waste plastic materials 
also during  we used a substantial amount of plastic inventory that was acquired in earlier periods at less than market prices 
this helped to offset rising material costs through the year by lessening our dependence on outside suppliers 
our in house plastic processing capacity went from in to in the first quarter of we focused on better material handling techniques and efficiencies in order to further reduce manufacturing waste and handling costs 
increasing our in house plastic processing facilities lowered our variable cost of purchasing recycled plastic scrap  but also increased our manufacturing overhead and additional processing costs 
with increased fixed overhead for recycling and processing infrastructure  sufficient volumes and throughputs are required to lower overall costs 
lower cost  poor quality plastic scrap can cause decreased throughputs and significant increases in overall cost 
this effect contributed somewhat to higher overall manufacturing costs and lower gross margin in the fourth quarter of overall  we were successful in reducing cost of goods sold as a percent of sales by improved focus and investing in new facilities  ie productivity gains offset rising material costs  which helped us to achieve an increase in operating income to million from  in 
table of contents selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative cost increased in compared to as a result of increases in sales  customer service  and corporate personnel expenses  along with general increases in corporate costs to manage our growing business 
however  as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative costs decreased 
some of the major components of selling  general  and administrative costs were salaries  commissions  advertising and promotion  travel and entertainment and professional fees 
the preceding cost categories as a percent of sales were lower in when compared to 
net income net income before extraordinary item in was million compared to a net loss before extraordinary item of  in  an improvement of million 
compared to  net income before extraordinary item increased due to increased sales  lower manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales  and lower selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales 
net income after extraordinary item was million compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs of reconstructing the junction facility following a march fire resulted in a  extraordinary gain for compared to an extraordinary gain of million in extraordinary item there was a major fire at the junction  texas facility in the junction facility was fully insured 
damage caused by the fire required us to write down gross assets by approximately million 
we simultaneously adjusted accumulated depreciation on those assets by million  resulting in a net book value decrease in assets of about  at december   we had invested approximately million in reconstructing the junction facility 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs incurred to reconstruct the facility resulted in a gain of  for the year ended december  through december   the total extraordinary gain recorded as a result of the fire was  total insurance proceeds in connection with the fire were million received through december  we had initially booked a receivable of approximately  and related income in the first quarter of for additional amounts we expected to collect from the insurers related to such matter 
however  such claims are now being contested by the insurer and  although we intend to vigorously pursue the collection of such claims  we have  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  reversed any receivable or income for the fiscal year attributable to such disputed claims unless and until such claims are collected 
contingencies liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of  compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  at december   the working capital deficit included total current liabilities of approximately million  of which million was for accrued payroll expense and other accrued liabilities  million was in payables and million was a combination of short term notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
our rapid growth and current cash flow from operations is restricting the growth of our working capital 
the working capital deficit is the result of previously incurred losses from operations  our decision to pay for our capital expansion using cash generated from operations  our need to fund rapid growth in sales  and our need to use working capital to pay for a portion of the rebuild of our junction  texas facility after the fire  as our insurance claim was contested by our insurer  lloyd s london see item legal proceedings 
additionally  pursuant to our bond agreement  we are required to maintain a debt service reserve fund in the amount of approximately million  which is classified as a non current asset in our balance sheet 
cash increased  to million at december  from million at december  significant components of that increase were i cash provided by operating activities of million  
table of contents which consisted of the net income for the period of million increased by depreciation and amortization of million and decreased by other uses of cash of approximately million  ii cash used in investing activities of million  and iii cash used in financing activities of approximately  payments on notes during the period were million  and proceeds from the issuances of notes amounted to million 
at december   we had bonds and notes payable in the amount of million  of which million was current notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
our expansion plans currently are prioritized around adding extrusion capacity at springdale south  increasing plastic recycling capacity to lower raw material costs  and further automating our production processes to improve efficiencies and increase margins 
new capital projects are funded primarily from cash flow  and there is no assurance as to when additional funds will be available or as to when the projects will be completed 
our capital improvement budget for is currently estimated at million  of which we believe we can finance million through long term debt and operating leases  the balance of required funds must come from cash flow 
there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow to meet our objectives 
if we are unable to complete our capital expansion program as planned  it will affect our ability to grow sales and profit margins in and future years 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a new million bank line of credit  replacing the factoring arrangement with brooks investment co 
that is currently in use 
the line is a one year revolving credit facility maturing january   secured by our inventory  accounts receivable  chattel paper  general intangibles and other current assets  as well as by fixtures and equipment  and is provided by liberty bank of arkansas at a variable interest rate of prime plus one hundred basis points 
the maximum amount that may be drawn on the line at any one time is million 
the full amount of the line is guaranteed as to payment by our largest stockholder  marjorie brooks 
the credit facility includes debt service coverage ratio  current ratio  and accounts payable and accounts receivable aging covenants substantially similar to those under our bond agreements and customary restrictions on dividends and the incurrence of additional debt or liens  among other matters 
under the bond agreement  aert covenants that it will maintain certain financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with the covenants  or to secure a waiver of the covenants  the bond trustee would have the option of demanding immediate repayment of the bonds 
in such an event  we would be unable to repay the bonds from current or reasonably foreseeable cash resources  and there can be no assurance we would be able to refinance the bonds 
we were not in compliance with two of the bond covenants as of december  the bond trustee waived these covenants as of december  through  and including  december  we expect to be in compliance with all bond covenants by december  bonds payable and allstate notes payable debt covenants december  compliance long term debt service coverage ratio for last four quarters of at least to yes current ratio of not less than to as adjusted no waived debt to equity ratio of not more than to yes not more than of accounts payable in excess of days past invoice date no waived not more than of accounts receivable in excess of days past invoice date yes the current ratio calculation was modified by the waiver to include the debt service reserve fund of  in current assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements 
the estimates made in applying the accounting policies described below are material to the financial statements and notes thereto due to the level of judgment involved in arriving at those estimates 

table of contents accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances 
delinquency fees are not assessed 
payments of accounts receivable are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customers remittance advice 
accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimated reserve made for returns and discounts based on quarterly review of historical rates of returns and expected discounts to be taken 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced  if needed  by a valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances that exceed thirty days from the invoice date  and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that may not be collected 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation based on its assessment of the current status of the individual accounts 
balances that remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to trade accounts receivable 
changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the financial statements 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
due to the nature of our business and our association with large national corporations  our collection of receivables has stayed at a constant level with very few uncollectible accounts 
buildings and equipment property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and acquisition  construction and administrative costs allocable to construction projects and property purchases 
provision for depreciation of buildings and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of property are credited or charged to income in the period incurred 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to income in the period incurred  unless it is determined that the useful life of the respective asset has been extended 
we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires an assessment of the recoverability of our investment in long lived assets to be held and used in operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
such assessment requires that the future cash flows associated with the long lived assets be estimated over their remaining useful lives 
an impairment loss may be required when the future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation we have to date accounted for our stock option plans and other stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows us to use the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations see note to the financial statements 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company typically recognizes revenue at the time of shipment or segregated and billed under a bill and hold agreement 
the terms of this agreement qualify for revenue recognition under sab sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  and returns 

table of contents estimates of expected sales discounts are calculated by applying the appropriate sales discount rate to all unpaid invoices that are eligible for the discount 
the company s sales prices are determinable given that the company s sales discount rates are fixed and given the predictability with which customers take sales discounts 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases total our waste wood and scrap polyethylene supply contracts have varying terms and pricing structures 
the contracts generally obligate us to take whatever waste the supplier generates as long as the waste meets our standards 
pricing for these contracts can be renegotiated every six or twelve months  however  so determining our precise future liability is not reasonably estimable 
uncertainties  issues and risks there are many factors that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  decline in demand  business or industry changes  critical accounting policies  government rules and regulations  environmental concerns  litigation  new products product transition  competition  acts of war  terrorism  public health issues  concentration of customer base  availability of raw materials at a reasonable price  management s failure to execute effectively  inability to obtain adequate financing  equipment breakdowns  low stock price  and fluctuations in quarterly performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no material exposures relating to our long term debt because all of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of outstanding debt 
we depend on the market for favorable long term mortgage rates to help generate sales of our product for use in the residential construction industry 
should mortgage rates increase substantially  our business could be impacted by a reduction in the residential construction industry 
important raw materials that we purchase are recycled plastic and wood fiber  which are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by negotiating with each supplier on a term basis
