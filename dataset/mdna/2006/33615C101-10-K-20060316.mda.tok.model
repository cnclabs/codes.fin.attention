the company achieved continued profitability in  with significant increases in assets  deposits and loans 
the company continues to benefit from strategic decisions made previously  when the company initiated a program of prudent  managed growth  this program resulted in higher levels of earning assets and interest revenue in  and the company s profitability was also in part a reflection of the continued low levels of nonperforming loans  other real estate owned  and other nonearning assets 
average assets in were  compared to  in and  in as was the case in and  the company s asset growth in was funded by an increase in deposits  as well as by the retention of earnings for the year 
the company generated net income of  in compared to  in and  in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment as described in loan portfolio and provision for loan losses 
we generally cease to accrue interest on any loan with respect to which the loan s contractual payments are more than days delinquent  as well as loans classified substandard for which interest payment reserves were established from loan funds rather than borrower funds 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan for which management has determined that collection of our investment in the loan is not reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure  are transferred to the other real estate owned portfolio and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less costs to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value includes revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property less construction and renovation costs 
net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest income earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest income or expense are determined by the average volume of interest bearing assets or liabilities  and the average rate of interest earned or paid on those assets or liabilities 
as was the case during  in the company s continued growth efforts resulted in an increase in interest earning assets  including loans 
the bank s core loan portfolio increased significantly during the company s growth reflects an increase in total deposits resulting from an increase in full service bank branches during and an increase in personnel in and while the deposit growth was centered in noninterest bearing deposits  time deposits and money market deposits  there was also growth in savings deposits 
average money market and time deposits increased in as compared to the prior year 
deposit levels increased and interest rates increased in from  and the combination led to an increase in interest expense in interest rates and interest differential the following table sets forth the average balances outstanding for major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the average interest rates earned and paid thereon for year ended december  average balance interest income expense average yield rate average balance interest income expense average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans investment securities federal funds sold time deposits with other financial institutions total interest earning assets for year ended december  average balance income expense yield rate average balance income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities savings deposits money market accounts time deposits fhlb advances other borrowings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities this figure reflects total loans  including non accrual loans  and is not net of the allowance for losses  which had an average balance of   and  in  and respectively and is not net of deferred loan fees  which had an average balance of   and  in  and respectively

includes loan fees of  and  in and  respectively 
because customer deposits are the company s principal funding source outside of its capital  management has attempted to match repricing characteristics of its deposits with its investment and loan portfolios as part of its liquidity and asset and liability management policies 
the objective of these policies is to manage the company s interest rate sensitivity and limit the fluctuations of net interest income resulting from interest rate changes 
the table which follows in section a indicates the repricing or maturity characteristics of the major categories of the bank s assets and liabilities as of december   and thus the relative sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
other operating income other operating income increased for to  versus  in and  for the year trust administration services corp

the bank has developed a substantial portfolio of short and medium term mini perm first trust deed loans for income properties as well as specializing in construction lending for moderate size commercial and residential projects 
the bank also offers commercial loans for commercial and industrial borrowers  which includes equipment financing as well as short term loans 
typically the bank s loans are floating rate and have no prepayment penalties 
interest only loans allow interest only payments for a fixed period of time 
the loans generally mature at the end of the interest only period and require a balloon payment 
at december  and we had  and  of short and medium term mini perm first trust deed loans for income properties with interest only payments that have a balloon payment at loan maturity 
the bank does not offer residential mortgage products  negative amortization loans  option arms  or sub prime loan products 
the allowance for loan losses is intended to reflect the known and unknown risks which are inherent in a loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is continually evaluated in light of many factors  including loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the company s emphasis on maintaining high asset quality continued in  and as a result  non performing assets loans past due ninety days or more excluding government guaranteed loans  loans on nonaccrual status  and other real estate owned totaled  of total loans at the end of   on december  and  on december  management believes the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate in relation to both existing and potential risks in the loan portfolio 
the bank has historically evaluated the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses on an overall basis rather than by specific categories of loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  known problem loans  evaluations made by bank regulatory authorities  assessment of economic conditions and other appropriate data to identify the risks in the loan portfolio 
the first major element includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio in two phases 
the first phase is conducted in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
individual loans are reviewed to identify loans for impairment 
a loan is impaired when principal and interest are deemed uncollectable in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is measured as either the expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the loan s collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or an observable market price of the loan if one exists 
upon measuring the impairment  the bank will insure an appropriate level of allowance is present or established 
central to the first phase and the bank s credit risk management is its loan risk rating system 
the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating  which is based primarily on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition  which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
credits undergo a quarterly loan review and a periodic review by the regulators 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
based on the risk rating system specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicates the probability that a loss has been incurred 
management performs a detailed analysis of these loans  including  but not limited to  cash flows  appraisals of the collateral  conditions of the marketplace for liquidating the collateral and assessment of the guarantors 
management then determines the inherent loss potential and allocates a portion of the allowance for losses as a specific allowance for each of these credits 
the second phase is conducted by evaluating or segmenting the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in this second phase  groups or pools of homogeneous loans are reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
additionally groups of non homogeneous loans  such as construction loans  are also reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
the risk assessment process in this case emphasizes trends in the different portfolios for delinquency  loss  and other behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios 
the second major element in the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of management s considerations of all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect a loan s collectibility 
this includes management s estimates of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties  the volatility of the market value of collateral  and other relevant factors 
the relationship of the two major elements of the allowance to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions which are charged to operating expense and is reduced by loan chargeoffs 
any subsequent recoveries of charged off loans are added back into the allowance 
based on its ongoing analysis of the risks presented by its loan portfolio  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses  a significant increase from the prior year due to the substantial increase in the loan portfolio   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
by way of comparison  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and no loans previously charged off were recovered 
these transactions brought the balance of the allowance for loan losses at the end of to  or of total loans  compared to the balance of  or of total loans  and compared to  or of total loans at december  in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in contrast  during  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
the company s policy is generally to discontinue the accrual of interest income on impaired loans  and to recognize income on such loans only after the loan principal has been repaid in full  and to establish a specific loss reserve for each of the loans which at december  and totaled  and  respectively  for the loans as a group 
operating expenses total operating expenses rose in  to  from  in and  in while the total expense figures increased primarily due to increases in overall bank growth  most components continue to be moderated by the effects of an ongoing program of expense control 
salaries and related benefits expense increased again in  rising to  from a total of  and from  in the increase in this expense category principally reflects the increases in staffing in the main office and the new regional offices as part of the company s growth initiative 
occupancy expense rose in  to  from  in and a total of  the increases reflect the rent paid on the various facilities which house the bank s expansion of regional offices 
other expenses rose again in as they did in and other expenses totaled  in compared to  in  which was increased from  in other expenses in include professional services of  an increase from the prior years when professional services were  for and  in  the increases primarily relate to increased audit and accounting fees due to the more extensive regulatory requirements applicable to larger companies 
data processing fees increased in to  compared to  in and  in equipment expense increased to  during from  during and  for customer courier service expense increased to  during from  during and  for the increases in data processing fees  equipment expense and customer courier service expense relate primarily to the growth of the bank 
directors fees increased due to increased corporate regulations and were  in   in  and  in most of the remaining categories of other expense generally remained stable with the exception of the special reserve noted below  which rose to  in from  in and  in principally due to higher costs of services provided to customers 
during the year ended december   the issuer s subsidiary  first regional bank  recorded a charge of  reflected in other expense to add to a special reserve in connection with the termination of certain business operations of the bank s merchant services division 
the  reserve represents approximately of an amount  approximately million  that the bank has been carrying as a receivable due from an outside service provider 
while the bank believes that it is entitled to the entire amount due of approximately million  the bank established the reserve due to the uncertain and protracted timing of collection 
the bank continues to pursue its collection efforts and will continue to monitor the status of the reserve based upon the success of such collection efforts 
from time to time  depending on the results of such collection efforts  the bank expects that it will evaluate whether the size of the reserve should be increased  reduced or eliminated 
any such adjustment will either result in a charge to earnings or a recovery 
taxes the combined effects of the activity described above resulted in income before taxes of  in  up from  in  and  in in  the company recorded tax provisions of  the company recorded tax provisions of  and  during and  respectively 
as a result  the company generated net income of  in  compared to  in  and versus net income of  in contractual obligations the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments

recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 and its related implementation guidance  is a revision of sfas no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
this revision of sfas no 
eliminates the ability for public companies to measure share based compensation transactions at the intrinsic value as allowed by apb opinion no 
 and requires that such transactions be accounted for based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this statement also amends sfas no 
 to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
under the intrinsic value method allowed under apb opinion no 
 the difference between the quoted market price as of the date of the grant and the contractual purchase price of the share is charged to operations over the vesting period  and no compensation expense is recognized for fixed stock options with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the dates of grant 
under the fair value based method as prescribed by sfas no 
r  the company is required to charge the value of all newly granted stock based compensation to expense over the vesting period based on the computed fair value of the award on the grant date 
additionally  the fair value of the award is to be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the statement does not specify a valuation technique to be used to estimate the fair value but states that the use of option pricing models such as a lattice model eg a binomial model or a closed end model eg the black scholes model would be acceptable 
the revised accounting for stock based compensation requirements must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt this standard effective january   using the modified prospective method  recording compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
currently  the company does not recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation 
management does not anticipate that this will have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows

inflation the impact of inflation on the company differs significantly from other industries  since virtually all of its assets and liabilities are monetary 
during periods of rising inflation  companies with net monetary assets will always experience a reduction in purchasing power 
inflation continues to have an impact on salary  supply  and occupancy expenses  but the rate of inflation in general and its impact on these expenses in particular has remained moderate in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since customer deposits are the company s principal funding source outside of its capital  management has attempted to match rates of its deposits with its investment and loan portfolios as part of its liquidity and asset and liability management policies 
the objective of these policies is to manage the company s interest rate sensitivity and limit the fluctuations of net interest income resulting from interest rate changes 
the table which follows indicates the repricing or maturity characteristics of the major categories of the bank s assets and liabilities as of december   and thus the relative sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
one month six months one year but less but less but less non interest floating less than than than than five years earning or category rate one month six months one year five years or more bearing total in thousands fed funds sold interest bearing deposits in financial institutions investment securities subtotal loans total earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment other real estate owned other assets total non earning assets total assets advances from fhlb repurchase agreements subtotal savings deposits money market deposits time deposits subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities equity capital total non interest bearing liabilities and equity capital total liabilities and equity capital gap cumulative gap as the table indicates  the vast majority of the company s assets are either floating rate or  if fixed rate  have short maturities 
since the yields on these assets quickly adjust to reflect changes in the overall level of interest rates  there are no significant unrealized gains or losses with respect to the company s assets  nor is there much likelihood of large realized or unrealized gains or losses developing in the future 
the bank s investment portfolio continues to include high quality  low risk securities  principally us treasury and government sponsored enterprise securities 
the balance of the bank s investment portfolio contains investments that qualify for cra investment status 
no gains or losses were recorded on security sales during  or as of december  the bank s investment portfolio contained gross unrealized losses of  and no gross unrealized gains  for unrealized losses net of tax benefit of  as of both december  and december  the bank s investment portfolio contained no gross unrealized losses or gains 
because the company s holdings of securities are intended to serve as a source of liquidity should conditions warrant  the securities have been classified by the company as available for sale  and thus unrealized gains and losses have no effect on the company s income statement
