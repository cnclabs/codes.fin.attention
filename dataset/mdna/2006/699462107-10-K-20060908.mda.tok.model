on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company regards an accounting estimate underlying its financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
the company believes that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results 
table of contents revenue recognition service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as services are performed 
the company measures progress for fixed price contracts using the concept of proportional performance based upon a unit based output method 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates and the actual cost incurred that were not recovered from clients 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned

changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s effective tax rate

the company is required under financial interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes in interim periods an interpretation of apb opinion no 
to exclude from its quarterly worldwide effective income tax rate calculation losses in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company s estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the company has assessed the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
in fiscal years and the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing that value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment identified at june  or any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations

table of contents the company has a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating interest 
each legal entity owned by the company and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
interest income and interest expense are recorded separately in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
financing needs the company s primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facility related expenses 
the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if the company were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  the company s revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  parexel believes that its existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
in the future  the company expects to continue to acquire businesses to enhance its service and product offerings  expand its therapeutic expertise  and or increase its global presence
