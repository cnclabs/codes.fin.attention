item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of sophisticated software solutions designed specifically to address the demand and supply chain management  business process  decision support  inventory transaction support  e commerce  inventory optimization and replenishment  collaborative planning and forecasting  space and floor planning  and store operations requirements of the retail industry and its suppliers 
our solutions enable customers to manage and optimize their inventory flows throughout the demand chain to the consumer  and provide optimized labor scheduling for retail store operations 
our customers include over  of the world s leading retail  cpg manufacturing and wholesale organizations 
we also offer maintenance services to our software customers  and enhance and support our software business by offering implementation and other services that are designed to enable our clients to rapidly achieve the benefits of our solutions 
these services include project management  system planning  system design and implementation  custom configurations  and training services 
demand for our implementation services is driven by  and often trails  sales of our software products 
consulting services revenues are generally somewhat more predictable but generate significantly lower gross margins than software license revenues 
significant trends and developments in our business outlook for software license sales in fourth quarter were below our expectations primarily due to a number of transactions that did not close as expected during the fourth quarter 
we do not believe these delays are indicative of a fundamental change in our competitive position in the market and we expect to close a significant number of these transactions in we closed transactions during fourth quarter  including three large software license deals in excess of million  and among the transactions we had included in our pipeline for fourth quarter of  there were only three unexpected competitive losses that were to three different competitors 
software license sales have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter as our business cycle is typically longer than days and it remains difficult for us to predict whether and exactly when larger software license transactions will close 
as a result  we believe it is more appropriate to provide guidance on expected financial results on an annual rather a quarterly basis 
total revenues were relatively flat in compared to software license sales decreased in compared to for  we expect total revenues to increase to over and range between million to million  absent the effect of any acquisitions  and software license sales to increase to and range between million and million 
we do  however  expect software license sales to be down sequentially in first quarter compared to fourth quarter which is a typical seasonal trend 
we expect improved software license revenue performance in the americas region in the consulting services business in this region has benefited from the increased sales of the merchandise management systems over the past two years  particularly those sold to tier retailers 
we expect this trend to continue in as we believe there are a significant number of tier retailers currently using first generation merchandise operations systems purchased in the late s from certain smaller competitors that have been subsequently acquired  are no longer in business or whose long term financial viability is now in question 
this situation could give rise to a number of new customer opportunities in 
table of contents we believe our competitive position for these opportunities would be strong as we are able to provide a lower cost of ownership combined with an established reputation for delivery of merchandise operations systems in the tier market 
we believe the operational issues and management changes that have impacted the european region over the past two years have been largely addressed and although we still have a few open sales positions  we saw improved software sales performance in and we expect further improved software sales performance in the consulting services business in this region has been significantly impacted by lower software sales over the past two years 
we believe it may take longer to deliver meaningful consulting services revenues growth in the european region as the software mix continues to be dominated by sales of strategic demand management solutions  which typically have shorter implementation timeframes and require fewer services 
we also expect improved software license revenue performance in the asia pacific region in we expect improved software license revenue performance in each of our retail enterprise systems  in store systems and collaborative solutions business segments in economic conditions and long replacement cycles have negatively impacted the demand for the merchandise operations systems sold in our retail enterprise systems business segment since although we believe that significant growth in the transaction systems market will require sustained macroeconomic improvement  we have seen indications in recent quarters that companies are beginning to address long standing issues in their enterprise systems environments  which has and could potentially signal further general improvement in demand for our merchandise operations systems 
we continue to believe there are a substantial number of retailers worldwide who will ultimately need to update their merchandise operations systems 
we expect a modest increase in our sales and marketing headcount in we recorded an impairment charge of million in fourth quarter to write off all goodwill in our in store systems business segment 
in recent years the in store systems business segment has performed below expectations  we believe in part due to the fact that a majority of the near term replacement cycle activity has been in the grocery sector where we do not actively market our point of sale systems 
as a result  we have adjusted the expectations for point of sale systems in our operating plans and are currently projecting a slower growth rate in this business segment 
the in store systems business segment has also been negatively impacted in recent years by poor economic conditions that have caused retailers to delay major capital appropriations and by what we believe is a major platform transition as market demand moves from windows based to java based point of sale applications 
we continue to believe there is growth opportunity in the in store systems market  however  we do not expect this business segment to experience any significant organic growth until the anticipated replacement cycle for point of sales systems in the specialty retail market accelerates  our java based in store system applications become more functionally mature and competitive  and early adopters complete their implementations and become referenceable 
the next major release of our java based point of sale application is scheduled for the first half of the uncertainty about the replacement cycle for point of sales systems is offset in part by an increasing opportunity in our sales pipeline for portfolio workforce management pwm  an application acquired in early that enables retailers to optimize the scheduling of labor which typically represents a retailer s next largest operational cost after inventory 
we believe the marketability of pwm has improved and we have spent the last two years enhancing the product and improving the referenceability of pre acquisition accounts 
we are committed to our in store systems business as we believe it is a strategic component of our total business solution offering 
no indications of impairment have been identified with respect to the goodwill in our retail enterprise systems and collaborative solutions business segments 
we are seeing broad interest in our initial portfolioenabled solutions for replenishment optimization and enterprise planning 
we are currently working with customers on projects involving the implementation of the pro or enterprise planning solutions 
we believe this early validation of our next generation of solutions indicates that the unique capabilities and architecture of our portfolioenabled solutions can be compelling to tier retailers ie  retailers with revenues of billion or more as well as to tier retailers 
our north american beta partner on pro went live on this solution in select departments during fourth quarter  providing further validation to the marketplace 
we plan to expand our customer base for pro and enterprise planning during  however  both products are in a typical early adoption curve and we believe market acceptance will improve as additional customers go live and become referenceable 
maintenance services revenues increased  or sequentially in fourth quarter compared to third quarter maintenance services revenues in fourth quarter benefited from the higher volume of software sales in third 
table of contents quarter and also includes approximately  of deferred maintenance revenue that was released upon the settlement of past due accounts 
during third quarter we experienced an increase in cancellations on maintenance agreements for certain of our merchandise operations systems and other product lines 
we have researched the specific causes for the cancellations and have determined that the attrition was related to customer specific issues and does not appear to represent a trend 
there were no major cancellations of maintenance agreements during fourth quarter we currently expect a modest increase in maintenance services revenues in compared to absent any significant change in the strength of the us dollar against foreign currencies in those countries in which we conduct business 
we plan to add approximately additional employees in the customer support solutions group during  primarily to support the activities of the cdd organization structure 
we expect this additional headcount will decrease maintenance services margins by to in compared to during  we focused on various initiatives to improve the revenue results and profitability of our consulting services organization 
these initiatives include the actions taken in fourth quarter and the first half of to increase the utilization of our consulting services personnel through headcount reductions see we recorded additional restructuring charges in related to our operating plan 
consolidated utilization rates improved to in compared to in  however  consulting services margins and revenue trends varied by geographic region 
utilization rates in the americas region improved to in compared to in this result was offset by lower utilization rates and consulting services revenue in the europe region and lower hardware sales 
we believe the software sales performance in the second half of together with an increasing mix of merchandise operations systems opportunities in our sales pipeline will contribute to the gradual recovery of our services business in our service revenue margins were in compared to in we expect our service revenue margins to gradually improve in and for our utilization rates to improve with the anticipated increase in service revenues 
this improvement will be largely offset by a million decrease in hosting revenues in due to the merger of a large customer 
our long term target for service revenue margins range from the mid to high  however we do not expect to achieve these results during our operating plan was designed to deliver higher profitability through a reduced cost structure  even if global spending levels for information technology or the overall market environment did not improve compared to we reduced our operating costs and improved our overall profitability in as a result of the restructuring activities and cost reductions taken in fourth quarter and in first half of the restructuring efforts reduced our total operating costs and expenses by million excluding restructuring charges  amortization of intangibles  bad debt provisions and impairment charges in compared to operating results for reflect the impact of a lower average headcount versus  offset in part by a million increase in total incentive compensation in cautious buying patterns continue to impact our operating results 
the retail industry and its suppliers continue to exercise significant due diligence prior to making large capital outlays  and the decision making process for investments in information technology remains highly susceptible to deferral 
delays in the decision making process have been  and may continue to be  the most significant issue affecting our software license revenue results 
delays in the customer decision making processes have resulted from a number of factors including  but not limited to  uncertain economic conditions  extended due diligence procedures designed to minimize risk  corporate reorganizations  consolidations within the industry  the appointment of new senior management  and the increasing trend by companies to seek board level approval for all significant investments in information technology 
sales to new and existing customers have historically required between three and nine months from generation of the sales lead to the execution of a software license agreement 
in addition  sales cycles are typically longer and more complex for larger dollar projects  large multi national retail organizations and retailers in certain geographic regions 
as a result  we have and will continue to experience uncertainty predicting the size and timing of individual contracts  particularly the closure of large software licenses million or greater  which continues to remain uneven and unpredictable from quarter to quarter 
we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our software license revenues under an initial license fee model ilf model 
under the ilf model  software license contracts are structured to enable the company to recognize of the software license revenue upon execution of the contract provided all of the revenue recognition criteria set forth in statement of position  software revenue recognition and other relevant guidance have been met 
however  due to the elongated sales cycles we are experiencing and the absence of a predictable base demand  we have begun to increasingly offer larger customers  particularly in the americas region  the option to purchase software licenses under poc and milestone licensing models in order to mitigate their risk aversion 
under the poc model  customers are allowed to try one or more of our solutions before they purchase them  either in a proof of concept  pilot  or prototype environment  or during the performance of business process analyses or benchmarking activities 
we began offering these licensing models in the second half of and to date  we have started a total of poc and evaluation projects 
we 
table of contents have successfully converted of these projects into perpetual licenses including in  ten of the projects have been terminated  three have been deferred indefinitely and poc projects are still open 
the time to convert on poc projects  which is subject to multiple variables including a number of which are outside our control  has generally ranged from two months to nearly one year 
under the milestone model  payment of the software license fees are aligned with the achievement of defined milestones or deliverable objectives within an agreed timeframe 
until recently we only offered the milestone model on large merchandise operations systems implementations  however we have now begun to extend the program to larger software license sales of our strategic demand management solutions as well 
poc and milestone software license revenues accounted for of total software license revenue recognized in compared to in although the purchase of software licenses under the poc and milestone licensing models initially delays the recognition of revenue  we believe these licensing models may improve our ability to get customers to commit to the investment in our products and to predict the timing of software license revenues  thereby over time  decreasing our dependence on the more unpredictable ilf model transactions 
our competitive environment is changing 
the enterprise software market continues to consolidate 
although the consolidation trend has resulted in fewer competitors in every significant product market we supply  it has also resulted in larger  new competitors with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we possess 
this could create a significant competitive advantage over us and negatively impact our business 
the consolidation trend is evidenced by oracle s acquisitions of retek  profitlogic  inc and of commerce  and by sap ag s acquisition of triversity  inc and its pending acquisition of khimetrics  inc 
oracle did not compete with our retail specific products prior to its acquisition of retek and although this acquisition has not significantly impacted our near term strategy  it is difficult to estimate what effect this acquisition will ultimately have on our competitive environment 
we have recently encountered competitive situations with oracle in certain of our international markets where  in order to encourage customers to purchase their retail applications  we suspect they have offered to license their database applications at no charge 
we have also encountered competitive situations with sap ag where  in order to encourage customers to purchase licenses of its non retail applications and gain retail market share  they have offered to license at no charge certain of its retail software applications that compete with the jda portfolio products 
if large competitors such as oracle and sap ag and other large private companies are willing to license their retail and or other applications at no charge it may result in a more difficult competitive environment for our products 
in addition  we could face competition from large  multi industry technology companies that have historically not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market 
oracle s acquisition of retek has the potential to create some additional delays around decisions made by larger tier customers to purchase merchandise operations systems  however  we believe there are only a small number of these decisions made each year 
we also believe that oracle and sap ag may have difficulty successfully competing for sales of merchandise operations systems in the tier marketplace as we do not believe they are able to implement solutions with a reasonable total cost of ownership in comparison with the value proposition we are able to offer customers in this market 
because competitors such as oracle and sap ag have significantly greater resources than we possess  they could also make it more difficult for us to grow through acquisition by outbidding us for potential acquisition targets 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully for customers or acquisition targets against our current or future competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe our strategic demand management solutions  which bring together forecasting and replenishment  planning and category management  revenue management and business optimization solutions  provide a unique offering and a strong competitive advantage as neither oracle or sap ag currently offer comparable comprehensive solutions 
although it appears that demand for merchandise operations systems may be increasing  we continue to believe that retailers and their suppliers are still focusing most of their information technology spending and efforts on applications that improve the efficiency of their operations and enable them to deliver earnings growth in a tough competitive environment 
our strategic demand management solutions address this need as they offer customers the potential for a higher short term roi and a lower total cost of ownership with less disruption to their underlying business 
the majority of our current software license transactions are for strategic demand management solutions 
product revenues from strategic demand management solutions transactions can be as high as the revenues realized on sales of merchandise operations systems 
software license revenues from existing customers represented and of software license revenues in and  respectively 
we believe sales of add on products to existing customers will continue to comprise a majority of our software revenues 
this metric is a direct result of our large customer base  principally amassed through the acquisitions of strategic demand management solutions such as portfolio space management by intactix and portfolio replenishment by e  that has and will continue to provide significant back selling and growth opportunities for 
table of contents both our existing portfolio synchronized products and our next generation portfolioenabled products 
nearly of our retail customer base and substantially all of our cpg manufacturing and wholesale customers still only own applications from one of our nearly product families 
we believe that once a customer has purchased multiple products from us  we are more likely to be viewed as a strategic partner in terms of their information systems strategy rather than simply a point solution provider 
business opportunities and growth strategies 
we continue to believe there are three distinct growth opportunities in the current economic environment we will continue to invest in our next generation portfolioenabled solutions based on soa based technology 
we believe this will differentiate us from many of our competitors and increase our market share as we bring these products to market 
we also believe the portfolioenabled solutions will enhance the cross selling opportunities in our customer base 
we will continue to develop our collaborative solutions business segment 
we believe we have established a leading position in this evolving and growing market for software solutions 
we also believe this collaborative market could grow to become a substantial portion of our business 
the collaborative solutions business segment remains a particular source of focus within our acquisition strategy 
we will focus on maximizing our market share in the replenishment cycle for merchandise operations systems that appears to be emerging  particularly in the tier market 
we have begun the transition process to the portfolioenabled solutions 
we are working with microsoft on a collaborative basis to promote the portfolioenabled solutions 
we have an active pipeline of opportunities that we are pursuing with the microsoft retail sales force  particularly in the united states 
we are unable to predict at this time if these collaborative efforts will be successful or have any significant impact on our ability to generate additional software license sales 
we reduced our level of product development expenditures in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in compared to by leveraging the most current release of the portfolio synchronized versions of our products 
jda portfolio version  the fourth synchronized release of our products  was released in first quarter and included enhancements to virtually all of our existing products that we believe will enable them to maintain their competitive edge 
during  we also plan to release jda portfolio version that will include new releases on most of our portfolio synchronized products 
we will continue selling the equivalent portfolio synchronized versions of our products over the next several years until the new portfolioenabled solutions have achieved critical mass in the marketplace 
we intend to follow an aggressive development plan for portfolioenabled solutions in and plan to spend approximately million in and increase our product development headcount by to employees in order to expedite these development efforts 
we have established a customer directed development cdd organization structure within our customer support solutions group that is responsible for improving the speed and efficiency of the company s issue resolution  support and enhancements for maintenance customers 
certain of our jda portfolio products  such as merchandise operations systems  require significant effort to upgrade 
while we believe we have historically managed to keep the cost of upgrades below that of most of our competitors  it may take years before our existing customers are prepared to upgrade to the portfolioenabled solutions 
cdd is designed to provide an innovative way to ensure that our existing customers continue to receive value from their jda portfolio products and maintenance agreements until they are ready to upgrade to the portfolioenabled solutions 
cdd will take minor enhancement requests from our customer special interest groups and provide packaged enhancements that can be used with multiple previous versions of the jda portfolio products 
to date  jda portfolio products moved to cdd include among others merchandise operations systems  win dss  store portals  performance analysis by ideas  advanced warehouse replenishment by e and advanced store replenishment by e the jda portfolio investment protection program provides existing customers with a right to like for like functionality in our new portfolioenabled solutions without additional license fee subject to certain conditions including a requirement that the new solution has no more than minimal differences in price  features  and functionality from the existing products 
customers will pay any required third party charges associated with the new portfolioenabled solutions 
we will encourage our customers to move to the portfolioenabled solutions  however  at this time we are unable to estimate how many of our existing customers will take advantage of this program 
a similar investment protection program is available for in store systems customers  which provides a right to like for like functionality from win dss to the portfolio point of sale application 
approximately one third of our domestic win dss customers have 
table of contents initially indicated they intend to participate in the in store systems investment protection program  however  to date  none have exercised this right 
we believe win dss customers have not exercised this right as the functionality of the portfolio point of sale application has not been commensurate with win dss 
we expect to release a more functionally equivalent version of portfolio point of sale in the first half of we intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we have historically looked at cash acquisitions in the million to million range that could be readily integrated  accretive to earnings  or that could shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we are now focusing our acquisition strategy on larger companies  particularly those that have significant recurring revenues or that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the collaborative solutions business segment  and acquisitions that can be accretive to earnings in a relatively short period of time post transaction and that can provide significant strategic growth opportunities for the company 
we recorded additional restructuring charges in related to our operating plan 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during to complete the restructuring initiatives contemplated in our operating plan 
these charges  which primarily include termination benefits and net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain vacated facilities  are in addition to the million restructuring charge recorded in fourth quarter which also included termination benefits and the negotiated buyout or net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain facilities that were vacated by december  the restructuring initiatives included a consolidation of product lines  a net workforce reduction of approximately or full time employees fte worldwide  and a reduction of certain office space in the united states and northern europe 
a total of fte were terminated or open positions eliminated through december  with an additional fte terminated during management believes the restructuring initiatives in the operating plan have enabled us to i generate substantially higher profits  ii streamline operations and reduce duplicate investments in product development by consolidating significant portions of the existing product suite on the

we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the short term foreign currency exchange exposure associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under financial accounting standard no

forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income  net  offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we have historically looked at cash acquisitions in the million to million range that could be readily integrated  accretive to earnings  or that could shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we are now focusing our acquisition strategy on larger companies  particularly those that have significant recurring revenues or that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the collaborative solutions business segment  and acquisitions that can be accretive to earnings in a relatively short period of time post transaction and which can provide significant strategic growth opportunities for the company 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in addition  any material acquisitions of complementary or synergistic companies  products or technologies could require that we obtain additional equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
treasury stock repurchase program 
in january  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices during a one year period ending january  the program was adopted as part of our revised approach 
table of contents to equity compensation  which will emphasize performance based awards to employees and open market stock repurchases by the company designed to mitigate or eliminate dilution from future employee and director equity based incentives 
the repurchase of shares under this program will result in a decrease to our working capital 
through december   we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under this program 
no additional purchases were made subsequent to december  and the program has now expired 
the board of directors may from time to time approve similar repurchase programs 
accelerated vesting of options 
on february   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the immediate vesting of all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees  officers and directors 
the accelerated options were issued under our stock option plan  stock option plan  outside director stock option plan and non statutory stock option plan 
the closing market price per share of our common stock on february  was and the exercise prices of the approximately million in unvested options on that date ranged from to 
the exercise of vested stock options would increase our working capital 
we recorded  of additional stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  with respect to these options 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes all known contractual obligations as of december  we have no capital lease obligations 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year to years to years years in thousands operating lease obligations operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases with minimum or remaining lease terms at december  we lease office space in the americas for regional sales and support offices across the united states  canada and latin america  and for international sales and support offices located in major cities throughout europe  asia  australia  and japan 
the leases are primarily non cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from months to months that expire at various dates through the year none of the leases contain contingent rental payments  however  certain of the leases contain insignificant scheduled rent increases and renewal options 
we expect that in the normal course of business some or all of these leases will be renewed or that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
in addition  we lease various computers  telephone systems  automobiles  and office equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from to months 
certain of the equipment leases contain renewal options and we expect that in the normal course of business some or all of these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and net cash provided from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
a major component of our positive cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable 
we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing instruments that have a low risk of capital loss  such as us government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds  and money market securities 
commercial paper must be rated by of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
corporate bonds must be rated aa or aa or better by moody s and s p  respectively 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 

table of contents we license software primarily under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting  training and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  that provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
software license revenue is generally recognized using the residual method when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and a license agreement has been signed  delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete  fees are fixed and determinable and there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  collection is considered probable  and vendor specific evidence of fair value vsoe exists for all undelivered elements 
our customer arrangements typically contain multiple elements that include software  options for future purchases of software products not previously licensed to the customer  maintenance  consulting and training services 
the fees from these arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on vsoe 
under the residual method  if an arrangement contains an undelivered element  the vsoe of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
if we are unable to determine vsoe for any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue recognition until all elements have been delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains milestones  customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone or upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
maintenance services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements 
maintenance services typically include on line support  access to our solution centers via telephone and web interfaces  comprehensive error diagnosis and correction  and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
maintenance services are generally billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or billed on an annual basis with the revenue initially deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
vsoe for maintenance services is the price customers will be required to pay when it is sold separately  typically the renewal rate 
consulting and training services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training 
these services are generally billed bi weekly on an hourly basis or pursuant to the terms of a fixed price contract 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
under fixed price contracts  including milestone based arrangements  consulting services revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
training revenues are included in consulting revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income and are recognized once the training services are provided 
vsoe for consulting and training services is based upon the hourly or per class rates charged when those services are sold separately 
we offer hosting services on certain of our software products under arrangements in which the end users do not take possession of the software 
revenues from hosting services are included in consulting revenues  billed monthly and recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from our hardware reseller business are also included in consulting revenues  reported net ie  the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to the supplier pursuant to eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and recognized upon shipment of the hardware 
customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element 
we do not sell or ship our software  nor recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable 
payments for our software licenses are typically due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
although infrequent  where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 

table of contents accounts receivable 
consistent with industry practice and to be competitive in the retail software marketplace  we typically provide installment payment terms on most software license sales 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element 
we do not sell or ship our software  nor recognize any revenue unless we believe that collection is probable in accordance with the requirements of paragraph in statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
for those customers who are not credit worthy  we require prepayment of the software license fee or a letter of credit before we will ship our software 
we have a history of collecting software payments when they come due without providing refunds or concessions 
consulting services are generally billed bi weekly and maintenance services are billed annually or monthly 
if a customer becomes significantly delinquent or their credit deteriorates  we typically put the account on hold and do not recognize any further services revenue and in most cases we withdraw support and or our implementation staff until the situation has been resolved 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
we review each past due account and provide specific reserves based upon the information we gather from various sources including our customers  subsequent cash receipts  consulting services project teams  members of each region s management  and credit rating services such as dun and bradstreet 
although infrequent and unpredictable  from time to time certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy  and we have been required to refund the pre petition amounts collected and settle for less than the face value of their remaining receivable pursuant to a bankruptcy court order 
in these situations  as soon as it becomes probable that the net realizable value of the receivable is impaired  we provide reserves on the receivable 
in addition  we monitor economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which we operate to determine if general reserves or adjustments to our credit policy in a region are appropriate for deteriorating conditions that may impact the net realizable value of our receivables 
goodwill and intangible assets 
our business combinations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and potential impairment charges we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires management to make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired  using a two step process that compares the fair value of future cash flows under the discounted cash flow method of the income approach to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to our reporting units 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fourth quarter to write off all goodwill in our in store systems business segment 
in recent years the in store systems business segment has performed below expectations  we believe in part due to the fact that a majority of the near term replacement cycle activity has been in the grocery sector where we do not actively market our point of sale systems 
as a result  we have adjusted the expectations for point of sale systems in our operating plans and are currently projecting a slower growth rate in this business segment 
the impairment charge is reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income under the caption loss on impairment of goodwill 
no indications of impairment have been identified with respect to the goodwill in our retail enterprise systems and collaborative solutions business segments 
trademarks are tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired  using the relief from royalty method of the income approach 
the premise of this valuation method is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the asset and assumes that in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
substantially all of our trademarks were acquired in connection with the acquisition of e we have assigned indefinite useful lives to our trademarks  and ceased amortization  as we believe there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that would limit their useful lives 
in addition  we intend to indefinitely develop next generation products under our trademarks and expect them to contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
impairment losses of  and million were recorded in fourth quarter and  respectively on the trademarks acquired from e these charges are reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income under the caption loss on impairment of trademark 
the impairment losses result from a lower software revenue forecast and a flattening of the projected revenue growth 
table of contents curve  rather than a change in legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that would limit the useful lives of the e trademarks 
acquired software technology is capitalized if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software 
amortization of software technology is reported as a cost of product revenues in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas no 

software technology is amortized on a product by product basis with the amortization recorded for each product being the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future revenue for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
the estimated economic lives of our acquired software technology range from years to years 
customer lists are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from years to years 
the values allocated to customer list intangibles are based on the projected economic life of each acquired customer base  using historical turnover rates and discussions with the management of the acquired companies 
we also obtain third party appraisals to support our allocation of the purchase price to these assets 
we estimate the economic lives of these assets using the historical life experiences of the acquired companies as well as our historical experience with similar customer accounts for products that we have developed internally 
we review customer attrition rates for each significant acquired customer group on a quarterly basis to ensure the rate of attrition is not increasing and if revisions to the estimated economic lives are required 
product development 
the costs to develop new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we consider technological feasibility to have occurred when all planning  designing  coding and testing have been completed according to design specifications 
once technological feasibility is established  any additional costs would be capitalized 
we believe our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances when recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered likely 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our income tax provision due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  we obtain an external review of our income tax provision by an independent tax advisor prior to the filing of our quarterly and annual reports 
uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations  the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the final tax determination could differ from our recorded income tax provision and accruals 
in such case  we would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
these adjustments could have a material impact on our income tax provision and our net income for that period 
stock based compensation

we do not expect that our outstanding stock options will result in a significant expense charge as they were fully vested prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r see note 
the full impact of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted as it will depend upon levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net cash flows from operating activities in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because this would depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  we recognized a tax benefit in  and of   and  respectively  in operating cash flows for such excess tax deductions 
a performance incentive plan incentive plan was approved by our stockholders on may  the incentive plan replaces the stock option plan  outside directors stock option plan and non statutory stock option plan collectively  our prior plans and provides for the issuance of up to  shares of common stock to employees  consultants and directors under stock purchase rights  stock bonuses  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance awards  performance units and deferred compensation awards 
the incentive plan contains certain restrictions that limit the number of shares that may be issued 
table of contents and cash awarded under each type of award  including a limitation that awards granted in any given year can be no more than one percent of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year 
awards granted under the incentive plan will be in such form as the compensation committee shall from time to time establish and may or may not be subject to vesting conditions based on the satisfaction of service requirements  conditions  restrictions or performance criteria 
we initially intend to make awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units based upon the company s achievement of operating goals primarily net income targets 
should the company successfully meet its targets  of the awards will vest at the date of grant and the remaining will vest ratably over a month period provided the individuals remain continuously employed by the company 
subsequent net income targets will be increased based upon the cost of the prior year s restricted stock awards 
restricted stock and restricted stock units may also be granted as a component of an incentive package offered to new employees or to existing employees based on performance or in connection with a promotion  and will generally vest over a three year period  commencing at the date of grant 
with the adoption of the incentive plan  the prior plans have been terminated except for those provisions necessary to administer the outstanding options  all of which are fully vested 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
international revenues represented of our total revenues in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
in addition  the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated net assets at december   as compared to at december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct 
table of contents business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
we have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such  foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange loss of million in and an unrealized foreign currency exchange gain of million in foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net working capital as of december  to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a currency translation loss of million before tax 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an associated net forward contract receivable of  at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an associated net forward contract liability of  the net forward contract liability is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the notional value represents the amount of foreign currencies to be purchased or sold at maturity and does not represent our exposure on these contracts 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our forward exchange contracts at december  based on the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a net forward contract liability of  that would offset the underlying currency translation loss on our net foreign assets 
we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of  in and foreign currency exchange gains of  and  in and  respectively 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and variable and fixed rate obligations of the us government and its agencies  states  municipalities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption other income  net 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have suffered a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million  which is approximately the same as amortized cost  with interest rates generally ranging between and
