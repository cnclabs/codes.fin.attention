item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of its software products  professional consulting  and support and maintenance services 
we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time we enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
we recognize revenue related to extended payment programs when payment becomes due to the company 
in making our decision to recognize revenue we must make a determination of the credit worthiness of our customer 
this determination involves management judgment and while management believes that it can make reliable judgments  there is no guarantee that the revenue recognized will be collected 
the credit worthiness of customers is further analyzed in the section below entitled accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
we have established sufficient vsoe for the value of our consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training or other services 
our products and the industries in which we compete are not static and the determination of vsoe involves judgment 
management believes that we will continue to be able to use the residual method for recognizing license revenue under multiple element arrangements 
if  for any reason  we are unable to continue to use the residual method  the timing of revenue recognition could be affected and  consequently  the trends that we are currently experiencing 
our professional services include custom font design  consulting services  development  and training 
we recognize professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
we had no long term contracts in progress as of december  we recognize revenue from end user product sales upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  if collection is probable 
we estimate returns and allowances based on historical rates and as of december   we did not have a reserve because returns and allowances have been negligible 
if and when a reserve is necessary we would reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
we periodically adjust estimates for returns based upon historical rates of return 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 

table of contents we generally warrant that our products will function substantially in accordance with documentation provided to customers for approximately days following initial delivery 
as of december   we had not incurred any expense related to warranty claims 
we estimate reserves based on historical rates and  accordingly  have not recorded a warranty reserve 
while management believes that we can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
please refer to note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tested recorded goodwill for impairment 
we have determined that we do not have separate reporting units and thus goodwill is combined and valued based upon an enterprise wide valuation 
we conducted impairment testing as of december  and determined that the fair value of the enterprise was greater than the carrying value 
although none of the unamortized goodwill was impaired  there can be no assurance that  upon completion of a future review  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sfas no 
required certain disclosures upon adoption that we have included in note k in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herewith 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery unlikely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
determination of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment 
we have fully reserved against our tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
we base our valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires us to make estimates  which we cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate

we believe that new customer acquisition  current customers adding licenses for existing and new products and additional unit shipments reported by oem customers will result in increased revenue for the increase in revenue from services was primarily due to increases in maintenance and support contracts associated with our publishing product line and increases in consulting services for both our publishing and font and font technology product lines

if we were required to obtain additional financing in the future  there can be no assurance that sources of capital would be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions of products  businesses and technologies that may complement or expand our business

pursuant to these agreements  we indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with any us patent  or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal  but we can provide no assurance that payments will not be required under these agreements in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to require that companies record as expense the effect of equity based compensation  including grants of employee stock options  at their fair value over the applicable vesting period 
sfas r offers alternative methods for determining the fair value 
the company currently discloses the effect on income loss that stock options would have were they recorded as expense in stock based compensation in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under current standards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income loss and net income loss per share 
sfas no 
r becomes effective in and we began implementation of sfas r in the reporting period beginning january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are short term money market accounts and bank deposits that are carried on the company s books at fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of our international subsidiary  bitstream  bv  are conducted almost exclusively in local currency 
bitstream  bv is currently inactive and the impact of currency exchange rate movements on inter company transactions was immaterial for the year ended december  international subsidiary operations  if resumed  will be translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
