risk factors and in part i  item business 
overview background monaco coach corporation the company is a leading manufacturer of premium recreational vehicles including class a  b  and c motor coaches  as well as towable recreational vehicles 
the company also develops and sells luxury motorcoach resort facilities 
these three operations  while closely tied into the recreational lifestyle  are segmented for reporting purposes as the motorized recreational vehicle mrv segment  the towable recreational vehicle trv segment  and the motorhome resort mr segment 
motorized and towable recreational vehicle segment products our products range in suggested retail price from  to  for motor coaches and from  to  for towables 
based upon retail registrations in  we believe we had share of the market for diesel class a motor coaches  a share of the market for gas class a motor coaches  a share of the market for all class a motor coaches  a market for all class c motor coaches  a share of the market for fifth wheel towables and a share of the market for travel trailers 
motorhome resort segment in addition to the manufacturing of premium recreational vehicles  the company also owns and operates two motorhome resort properties the resorts  located in las vegas  nevada  and indio  california 
the resorts offer sales of individual lots to owners  and also offer a common interest in the amenities at the resort 
lot prices at the two resorts range from  to  amenities at the resorts include club house facilities  tennis  swimming  and golf 
the resorts provide destination locations for premium class a recreational vehicle owners  and help to promote the recreational lifestyle 
business changes we have conducted a series of acquisitions during our history 
beginning in march when we commenced operations by acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a predecessor company that had been formed in in march  we acquired the holiday rambler division of harley davidson  inc  a manufacturer of a full line of class a motor coaches and towables 
in august  we acquired smc corporation  manufacturer of the beaver and safari brand class a motorhomes 
in november  we acquired from outdoor resorts of america ora three luxury motorcoach resort properties being developed by ora in las vegas  nevada  indio  california  and naples  florida 
in september  we sold the property in naples  florida 
and  in november of  we acquired r vision  inc  r vision motorized  llc  bison manufacturing  llc  and roadmaster  llc  referred to as r vision  manufacturers of r vision  bison  and roadmaster motorized and towable products 
the r vision acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  through a cash offer on november  all operations of r vision have been incorporated for the period of november  through december  in the consolidated annual financial statements of the company 
during the third quarter of  the company announced that it was closing its royale coach operations in elkhart  indiana 
royale coach produced prevost bus conversion motor coaches with price points in excess of million 
royale coach sold approximately coaches per year and was not a significant portion of the company s overall business 
as of the end of  all closure costs have been accrued for in the company s financial statements 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no goodwill amortization has been recorded for any of the company s acquisitions for the years of   or instead  sfas requires annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
we completed our annual testing of goodwill during the third quarter of as required by sfas and determined that there has been no impairment requiring a write down 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended january   and december  dollars in thousands of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses plant relocation costs operating income performance in motorized and towable recreational vehicle segments in the third and fourth quarters of  the recreational vehicle industry began to show signs of slowing down from its previously heated pace 
this trend continued through the first half of  and worsened during the second half of the year  resulting in net operating losses for both recreational vehicle segments 
accordingly  the company took steps to reduce production run rates within its various facilities and also shifted production output to reflect changes in product demand mix 
in addition  the company also relocated its bend  oregon manufacturing operations to its coburg  oregon facility  and ceased operating its royale coach bus conversion manufacturing business in elkhart  indiana 
while both of these decisions were difficult to make  they were positive steps toward maximizing utilization of manufacturing capacity at the various production plants 
costs associated with relocation of the bend  oregon operations are reflected as plant relocation costs  and represent actual costs incurred as well as estimates for future costs 
closure costs for the royale coach facility are shown after income from continuing operations  and are classified net of respective income taxes as discontinued operations 
closure costs reflect actual costs incurred as well as estimates for future costs 
while was challenging on several fronts  we worked aggressively to introduce new and innovative products such as our full slide options on several models  and a new lower priced front end diesel motorized coach 
we also acquired r vision to complement our higher line towable product offerings with r vision s lower priced models  thereby filling out our towable price points  and strengthening our position within the towable marketplace 
the recreational vehicle industry is extremely competitive and retail customers have many choices available to them 
to distinguish ourselves within the industry  we introduced our franchise for the future fftf program in june of this program was designed to introduce the concept to our dealer partners that our specific brands have intrinsic values as a selling tool 
to support this  and to encourage our dealers to participate in fftf  we worked with outside marketing consultants to develop brand signage  informational computer kiosks  and brand specific displays that are placed within our various independent dealer locations 
we believe that this concept  along with other features designed to entice our dealers to focus selling efforts on our various product offerings  will assist them in their sales efforts through the strength of improved brand identity 
motorhome resorts segment while was difficult for the recreational vehicle industry  our motorhome resort properties sales and profits were significantly improved over results 
both our properties in las vegas  nevada and indio  california experienced better than expected results of operations  with combined operating profits of million in versus operating profits of  in we believe that these resort properties will continue to sell through their respective remaining available inventories of lots in and in the first quarter of during we expect to evaluate opportunities for new property developments  with the intent of bringing new developments to the market in compared with net sales decreased from billion in to billion in gross diesel motorized revenues were down  gas motorized revenues were down  and towable revenues were up 
for  gross diesel motorized sales accounted for of sales  gas motorized sales accounted for of sales  and towables accounted for of sales 
for  gross diesel motorized sales accounted for of sales  gas motorized sales accounted for sales  and towables accounted for of sales 
the company s overall average unit selling price decreased from  in  to  in the reduction in average selling price resulted from a combination of increased sales of the company s towable products  the acquisition of r vision which sells predominantly lower priced towables and the sale of lower priced towable products to the federal emergency management association fema 
fema orders added approximately  sales of units to our towable production in the third and fourth quarters of combined 
gross profit decreased by million from million in to million in and gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin in is set forth in the following table dollars in thousands of sales of sales change in of sales direct materials direct labor warranty other direct indirect total cost of sales direct material decreases in  as a percent of sales  were due in part to purchasing initiatives  increases in products that have a lower material cost as a percentage of sales such as for fema travel trailers  and our resort property lots  as well as increases in the sale of motorcoach resort properties which have a lower cost of sale related to direct materials 
direct labor increases in  as a percent of sales  were predominantly due to plant inefficiencies caused by lower production run rates in versus decreases in warranty expense in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to quality improvement projects  and improvements in recoveries from vendors for warranty claims 
increases in combined other direct and indirect costs in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to inefficiencies within the plants as a result of reduced plant utilization 
in addition  due to higher fuel costs  delivery expense for recreational vehicles also increased which further dampened margins 
selling  general  and administrative expenses s  g  a increased by million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in increases in spending over the prior year  as a percentage of sales  are set forth in the following table dollars in thousands of sales of sales change in of sales wages and salaries selling expenses settlement expense advertising and print other total s  g a expenses decreases in wages and salaries in were mostly the result of lower management bonus due to reduced profitability of the company 
increases in selling expenses in  as a percent of sales  were due to a weaker market in versus  and the implementation of the company s franchise for the future fftf program 
as a result  the company increased spending to maintain market share  and to maximize available sales 
decreases in settlement expense litigation settlement expense in  as a percent of sales  was due to a slight decrease in the amount of new cases added  as well as favorable resolutions of cases during the year 
decreases in advertising and print costs in  as a percent of sales  were the result of management reducing spending in this area to contain costs 
increases in other expenses were a combination of expenses related to the implementation of the company s enterprise resource planning erp system  as well as certain fees for consulting services related to the launch of the fftf program 
operating income decreased million from million in to million in the company s higher level of selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales combined with the decreases in the company s gross margin  resulted in a decrease in operating margin from in to in that was only partially offset by improved results from our motorhome resort property segment 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in this increase was related to higher debt levels during increases in debt were mostly due to debt incurred with the acquisition of r vision 
capitalized interest was zero in both and the company s interest expense included  in and  in related to the amortization of debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the company s credit facilities 
the company reported a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of million  or an effective tax rate of  for  compared to million  or an effective tax rate of for the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of lower income levels in  including lower federal and state statutory rates and a larger percentage impact from state income tax credits and other tax benefit items 
the provision also includes a tax benefit of  associated with the reversal of federal and state tax reserves no longer required 
net income for was million including losses from discontinued operations of million  net of taxes  related to the closure of the royale coach facility  and pre tax charges of million for the relocation of the beaver facility compared to net income of million in due to a decrease in sales combined with a lower operating margin  and increases in s  g a expenses 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the company did not expense stock options grants in and earlier periods  however  if option expensing had been required  the effect on net income for for all previously granted options would have been a decrease of million 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding the calculation of the impact of expensing stock options 
the company will reflect the cost of stock options in its results of operations beginning in versus for the motorized recreational vehicle segment the following table sets forth the results of the mrv segment for the fiscal years ended january   and december  dollars in thousands of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses corporate overhead allocation plant relocation costs operating income loss total net sales for the mrv segment were down from billion in  to billion in gross diesel motorized revenues were down and gas motorized revenues were down 
diesel products accounted for of the mrv segment s gross revenues while gas products were 
the overall decrease in revenues reflected continuing challenges in the marketplace as dealers sought to lower their current inventories because of softened retail demand and higher interest costs associated with their floorplan borrowings 
our mrv segment unit sales were down year over year from  units in to  units in diesel motorized unit sales were down to  units and gas motorized unit sales were down to  units 
total average mrv segment unit selling prices increased to  for  up from  in increases in average selling prices are mostly the result of changes in product mix between diesel and gas motorized coaches

direct labor increases in  as a percent of sales  were predominantly due to inefficiencies in the production lines related to plant consolidations and lower production run rates 
increases in other direct costs in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to increases in employee health benefits  and delivery expense for the company s products 
increases in indirect costs  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to increased overhead costs per unit within the production facilities due to lower run rates in versus in addition  employee benefits related to worker s compensation and factory supplies increased  causing an overall increase in total dollars spent 
s  g  a expenses  for the mrv segment increased both as a percent of sales and in total dollars due in part to lower sales levels and increases in selling expenses 
corporate overhead allocation decreased due to lower management bonus levels allocated to the mrv segment as a result of lower profits 
corporate overhead allocation is comprised of certain shared services such as executive  financial  information systems  legal  and investor relations expenses 
plant relocation costs reflect the costs incurred to relocate the bend  oregon manufacturing operations to the coburg  oregon plant 
we believe this relocation will ultimately result in improved margins for the oregon operations 
operating income loss decreased as both a percent of sales and in total dollars due to lower gross margins  increases in s  g  a expenses and costs of the relocation of the bend  oregon operations to the coburg  oregon facility 
versus for the towable recreational vehicle segment the following table sets forth the results of the trv segment for the fiscal years ended january   and december  dollars in thousands of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses corporate overhead allocation operating loss total net sales for the trv segment were up from million in  to million in the overall increase in revenues reflected both the impact of the r vision acquisition in november as well as strong sales to fema related to hurricane katrina 
our unit sales were up in to  units

this improvement was somewhat dampened by higher commodity pricing for metals  petroleum products  and lumber materials 
direct labor decreases in  as a percent of sales  were predominantly due to higher production run rates in our plants in part due to fema orders 
decreases in warranty expense in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to an improvement in the warranty experience on current year models 
increases in other direct costs in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to increases in employee health benefits and delivery expense for the company s products 
increases in indirect costs in  as a percent of sales  were due mostly to increased overhead costs per unit related to fema production 
in addition costs of employee benefits related to worker s compensation and factory supplies increased  causing an overall increase in total dollars spent 
s  g  a expenses for the trv segment decreased as a percent of sales due in part to higher sales levels for which additional administrative costs were not incurred 
corporate overhead allocation increased slightly due to higher levels allocated to the trv segment as a result of the growth in this segment 
corporate overhead allocation is comprised of certain shared services such as executive  financial  information systems  legal  and investor relations expenses 
operating loss decreased as both a percent of sales and in total dollars due to improved gross margins and decreases in s  g  a expenses as a percentage of sales 
versus for the motorhome resorts segment the following table sets forth the results of the mr segment for the fiscal years ended january   and december  dollars in thousands of sales of sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses corporate overhead allocation operating income net sales increased to million compared to million for this increase was mostly the result of continued strong demand for our resort properties and the need within the industry for quality destination locations for rv owners 
gross profit for the resorts segment increased to of sales in  compared to of sales in this was due to a heavier absorption of infrastructure costs in earlier phases sold in these costs were expensed in earlier phases due to uncertainties as to the ultimate completion and sale of the entire projects 
the result was an improvement in the gross margins in the later phases of the developments  and most particularly in s  g  a expenses increased due to real estate commissions paid on the sales of lots 
additional increases were due to accruals for profit sharing payments which will be made to outdoor resorts of america upon completion of the project 
corporate overhead allocation is comprised of certain shared services such as executive  financial  information systems  legal and investor relations expenses 
operating income increased due to improvements in sales and gross margins that were only slightly offset by higher s  g  a costs

operating income increased due to improvements in sales and gross margins that were only slightly offset by higher s  g  a costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company generated cash of million from operating activities and had a net cash balance of  at december  the company generated million from net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
adjusted for the non cash activity due to the r vision acquisition  the other major sources of cash included a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the uses of cash in adjusted for the non cash activity due to the r vision acquisition included an increase of million in inventories  a decrease of million in trade accounts payables  a decrease of million in product liability reserves  a decrease of million in product warranty reserves  and a decrease of million in income taxes payable 
decreases in accounts receivable were due to the timing of shipments of our products at the end of versus increases in inventories were mostly the result of higher finished goods at the end of versus decreases in accounts payable were mostly due to payments made in the fourth quarter of for our franchise for the future fftf program 
these payments to our dealers for sales incentives earned were accrued for and paid out later in the year for decreases in product liability reserves  as well as for product warranty reserves were the result of continuing improvements in the quality of our products and lower sales volumes 
decreases in income taxes payable are the result of lower income for the year versus on november  the company amended its credit facilities to borrow million of term debt the term debt to complete the acquisition of r vision 
the revolving line of credit remains at million 
at the end of the year  borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit the revolving loan were million  and term debt borrowings were million 
at the election of the company  the revolving loan and the term debt bear interest at varying rates that fluctuate based on the prime rate or libor  and are determined based on the company s leverage ratio 
the company also pays interest quarterly on the unused available portion of the revolving loan at varying rates  determined by the company s leverage ratio 
the revolving loan is due and payable in full on november  and requires interest payments quarterly 
the term debt requires quarterly interest payments and quarterly principal payments of million  with a final balloon payment of million due on november  both the revolving loan and term debt are collateralized by all the assets of the company and the credit facilities include various restrictions and financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  the company utilizes zero balance bank disbursement accounts in which an advance on the line of credit is automatically made for checks clearing each day 
since the balance of the disbursement account at the bank returns to zero at the end of each day  the outstanding checks of the company are reflected as a liability 
the outstanding check liability is combined with the company s positive cash balance accounts to reflect a net book overdraft or a net cash balance for financial reporting 
the cash balance at december  is the cash maintained in the r vision bank accounts held with a different financial institution and thus not combined with the company s net book overdraft balance 
in november  the company obtained a term loan of  from the state of oregon in connection with the relocation of jobs to the coburg  oregon production facilities from the bend  oregon facility 
the principal and interest is due on april  the loan bears a annual interest rate 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and financing of trade receivables 
many of the company s dealers finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million  a decrease of million from working capital of million at january  the company has been using short term credit facilities and cash flow to finance its capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its anticipated credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  which included costs related to additions of automated machinery in many of its production facilities  upgrades to its information systems infrastructure  and other various capitalized upgrades to existing facilities 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for all of will be approximately to million  which includes expenditures to purchase additional machinery and equipment in both the company s coburg  oregon and wakarusa  indiana facilities  as well as upgrades to existing information systems infrastructures 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company significantly increases the level of working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period up to months 
at december   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
historically  the company has been successful in mitigating losses associated with repurchase obligations 
during  the losses associated with the exercise of repurchase agreements were approximately   and  in and  respectively 
gross repurchase amounts for   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have been successful at mitigating the losses associated with repurchase obligations 
dealers for the company undergo credit review prior to becoming a dealer and periodically thereafter 
financial institutions that provide floor plan financing also perform credit reviews and floor checks on an ongoing basis 
we closely monitor sales to dealers that are a higher credit risk 
the repurchase period is limited  usually to a maximum of months 
we believe these activities help to minimize the number of required repurchases 
additionally  the repurchase agreement specifies that the dealer is required to make principal payments during the repurchase period 
since the company repurchases the units based on the schedule of principal payments  the repurchase amount is typically less than the original invoice amount 
this lower repurchase amount helps mitigate our loss when we offer the inventory to another dealer at an amount lower than the original invoice as incentive for the dealer to take the repurchased inventory 
this helps minimize the losses we incur on repurchased inventory 
as part of the normal course of business  the company incurs certain contractual obligations and commitments which will require future cash payments 
the following tables summarize the significant obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total lines of credit long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration by period other commitments in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total lines of credit guarantees repurchase obligations total commitments see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements

see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation during and to a lesser extent in  we experienced increases in the prices of certain commodity items that we use in the manufacturing of our products 
these include  but are not limited to  steel  copper  aluminum  petroleum  and wood 
while these raw materials are not necessarily indicative of widespread inflationary trends  they had an impact on our production costs 
accordingly  in we adjusted selling prices to compensate for increases in commodity pricing 
also  due to increases in fuel prices  particularly in  our cost of delivering coaches to our dealers has risen 
accordingly  we have increased our delivery charges for the fourth quarter of to offset these rising costs 
while we do not anticipate additional price increases  we may from time to time increase our prices to maintain gross profit margins 
if we should continue to experience adverse trends in these prices it could have a material adverse impact on our business going forward 
see results of operations compared with critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty costs  product liability  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs estimated warranty costs are provided for at the time of sale of products with warranties covering the products for up to one year from the date of retail sale five years for the front and sidewall frame structure  and three years on the roadmaster chassis 
these estimates are based on historical average repair costs  as well as other reasonable assumptions as have been deemed appropriate by management 
product liability the company provides an estimate for accrued product liability based on current pending cases  as well as for those cases which are incurred but not reported 
this estimate is developed by legal counsel based on professional judgment  as well as historical experience 
impairment of goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
this initial test involves management comparing the market capitalization of the company  to the carrying amount  including goodwill  of the net book value of the company  to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
if the company determines that the market capitalization is not representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  then the company will use an estimate of discounted future cash flows to determine fair value 
inventory allowance the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value 
these write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
brand elements and signage as part of its franchise program for dealers  the company places certain fixed assets at independent dealerships 
these assets are comprised of informational computer kiosks  brand island displays  furniture and fixtures  as well as outdoor storefront signage 
these assets are leased to dealers over years through an operating lease  and the company depreciates the assets over their respective useful lives 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company must estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
a discussion of the income tax provision and the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
repurchase obligations upon request of a lending institution financing a dealer s purchases of the company s product  the company will execute a repurchase agreement 
the company has recorded a liability associated with the disposition of repurchased inventory 
to determine the appropriate liability  the company calculates a reserve  based on an estimate of potential net losses  along with qualitative and quantitative factors  including dealer inventory turn rates  and the financial strength of individual dealers 
new accounting pronouncements eitf in september of  the financial accounting standards board the board issued eitf  determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds

we will adopt the provisions of fas for the fiscal year beginning fas r in december  the board issued fas r  share based payment 
the statement replaces fas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payments to employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
fas r is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we will adopt the provisions of the fas r for the fiscal year beginning if we had included the cost of the employee stock option compensation using the fair value method in our financial statements  our net income for  and would have decreased by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings 
we do not currently use rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
our line of credit permits a combination of fixed and variable interest rate options which allows us to minimize the effect of rising interest rates by locking in fixed rates for periods of up to months 
we believe these features of our credit facilities help us reduce the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations
