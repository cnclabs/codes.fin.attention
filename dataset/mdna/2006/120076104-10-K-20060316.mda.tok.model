item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  
table of contents including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the leading  and only national  company providing a make your own stuffed animal interactive entertainment experience under the build a bear workshop brand  in which our guests stuff  fluff  dress  accessorize and name their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
our concept  which we developed for mall based retailing  capitalizes on what we believe is the relatively untapped demand for experience based shopping as well as the widespread appeal of stuffed animals 
the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of december   we operated stores in states and canada and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand 
in addition to our stores  we market our products and build our brand through our website  which simulates our interactive shopping experience  as well as our locations in major league baseball ballparks and our presence at event based locations through our mobile store 
we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows united states and canadian retail stores  a webstore and seasonal  event based locations  international stores operated under franchise agreements  and license arrangements with third parties which manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop brand 
selected financial data attributable to each segment for fiscal   and are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues  income and liquidity  see the revenues  costs and expenses and expansion and growth potential subsections of this overview 
we believe that we have developed an appealing retail store concept that  for stores open for the entire year  averaged million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in net retail sales per store 
for a discussion of the changes in comparable store sales in fiscal years  and  see revenues 
store contribution  which consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our webstore and seasonal event based locations  as a percentage of net retail sales  excluding revenue from our webstore and seasonal and event based locations  was for fiscal and for fiscal  and total company net income as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal and for fiscal see non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of store contribution to net income 
the store contribution of our average store  coupled with the fact that we have opened stores since the beginning of fiscal and improved expense management  primarily through improved labor planning and reductions in store supply and other expenses in  have been the primary reasons for our net income increasing during each of the last five fiscal years 
strong comparable store sales for fiscal  along with the factors cited above  were the primary reason for our increase in net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  as we have added stores and grown our sales volume  the quantities of merchandise and supplies we purchase have increased which has created economies of scale for our vendors allowing us to obtain reduced costs for these items and increase our profitability 
the increase in total store contribution has been partially offset by the increase in our central office general and administrative expenses required to support an expanding store base and international franchise operations 
these expenses have grown at a slower rate  in percentage terms  than our number of stores and net retail sales 
in addition  we significantly increased our advertising expenditures beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and these increased expenditures continued throughout fiscal and fiscal we expect to grow our business primarily through the continued opening of new stores 
further  we expect to grow our net retail sales  including comparable store sales  as a result of the continuation of national television and online advertising which we added to our marketing mix in fiscal we also plan to increase our revenues through increasing the number of international franchised stores  as well as the addition of new licensees and sales of licensed products for which we receive license revenue 
we expect to realize leverage on our national advertising programs as we expand and open stores in new markets 
we have been running national advertising since and believe that our brand awareness is higher and our entry into new markets is stronger as a result of the advertising and we expect to leverage these programs on an ongoing basis 
we expect to improve our store productivity as a result of comparable store sales increases and thereby improve our store contribution as a percentage of net retails sales by better leveraging our store level operating expenses  primarily those which are fixed such as occupancy  over increased net retail sales per store 
as we grow our total revenues  we also expect to decrease our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by leveraging 
table of contents these expenses  primarily those which are largely fixed such as management payroll and occupancy  over an increased revenue amount 
this decrease will be partially offset by some increases in general and administrative expenses  including marketing such as direct mail to support more stores and our growing international franchise business 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales 
net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our webstore and other non mall locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new or comparable stores and do not include our webstore or seasonal  event based locations in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation 
we opened three friends b made locations in to bring the total number of friends b made locations to five as of december  all of these locations are in or adjacent to a build a bear workshop store and share common store management  employees and infrastructure 
these locations are considered expansions of the existing build a bear workshop store and are not considered an addition to our total store count 
the net retail sales of these expanded build a bear workshop stores are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the expansion 
we have a frequent shopper program for our us stores whereby guests who purchase of merchandise receive off a future purchase 
an estimate of the obligation related to this program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of original purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced and a corresponding amount is recognized as net retail sales in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
we account for changes in the deferred revenue amount at the total company level only 
this is due to the fact that the frequent buyer discount can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
we use comparable store sales as a key performance measure for our business 
the percentage increase or decrease in comparable store sales for the periods presented below is as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales decreased by in fiscal following an increase of in fiscal we believe these changes can be attributed primarily to the following factors our ongoing programs in advertising 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we tested in a limited number of markets the use of television and online advertising and determined that it was successful in attracting a higher number of new and repeat guests 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented this marketing strategy on a national basis and quickly began achieving comparable store sales increases 
we continued this marketing approach throughout fiscal this approach was successful in maintaining our comparable store sales levels  but did not produce the increases that were achieved in fiscal when the change in the marketing program was an incremental addition to the prior year 
following an improved economy in  with higher levels of consumer confidence and a better retail climate  the economy showed mixed results in with varying levels of consumer confidence  record levels of crude oil prices and significant weather activity  particularly during the hurricane season 
we believe the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal was largely the result of four factors a difficult economic environment  including lower consumer confidence levels and a weak retail climate 
our inability to increase the number of transactions in comparable stores which we believe was the result of low brand awareness with potential new and repeat guests 
the transfer to new stores of a portion of existing stores sales  as we opened new stores in markets where we already operated one or more stores  causing the existing stores sales to decline  even though total sales in those markets increased 
we expect this factor to continue to affect us as we add new stores in markets where we have existing stores 
the large amount of initial trial sales in the first year a store is open  which we believe results from the distinctive nature of our concept and the publicity we normally receive when we open a new store  does not necessarily continue at that level after this period 
we expect this factor to continue to affect us  but it is difficult to predict to what degree  particularly if awareness of our brand continues to grow as a result of our change in marketing strategy 

table of contents franchise fees we receive an initial  one time franchise fee per master franchise agreement which is amortized to revenue over the life of the respective franchise agreement 
master franchise rights are typically granted to a franchisee for an entire country or countries 
continuing franchise fees are based on a percentage of sales made by the franchisees stores and are recognized as revenue at the time of those sales 
as of december   we had stores  including opened in fiscal  operating under franchise arrangements in the following countries united kingdom japan australia denmark other on march   we entered into definitive agreements to acquire amsbra limited amsbra  our franchisee in the united kingdom  and the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom 
amsbra operates all of the franchised build a bear workshop stores located in the united kingdom 
the transactions  which are subject to regulatory approval in the united kingdom  are expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of fiscal if the transactions close  as expected  all of the franchised locations in the united kingdom will become company owned stores 
licensing revenue licensing revenue is based on a percentage of sales made by licensees to third parties and is recognized at the time of those sales 
we have entered into a number of licensing arrangements whereby third parties manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop mark 
costs and expenses cost of merchandise sold and gross margin cost of merchandise sold includes the cost of the merchandise  royalties paid to licensors of third party branded merchandise  store occupancy cost  including store depreciation  freight costs from the manufacturer to the store  cost of warehousing and distribution  packaging  damages and shortages  and shipping and handling costs incurred in shipment to customers 
gross margin is defined as net retail sales less the cost of merchandise sold 
we have been able to reduce the unit costs of our merchandise and packaging through economies of scale realized as our sales volume has grown 
the increase in sales volume has also allowed us to reduce our freight  cost of warehousing and distribution costs as a percentage of net retail sales as a result of the cost efficiencies of shipping higher volumes of merchandise 
we expect to maintain these efficiencies in the future 
selling  general and administrative expense these expenses include store payroll and benefits  advertising  credit card fees  and store supplies  as well as central office general and administrative expenses  including management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance  legal and public relations 
this line item also includes depreciation and amortization of central office leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment as well as the amortization of intellectual property costs 
central office general and administrative expenses have grown over time in order to support the increased number of stores in operation and we believe will continue to grow as we add stores  but we expect this increase to be at a lower rate than the percentage increase in total revenues 
advertising increased significantly with the introduction in fiscal of our national television and online advertising campaign 
we maintained the level of advertising expense as a percentage of net retail sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and anticipate continuing this level of advertising expenditures in the future 
increases in comparable store sales results in fiscal as well as improvements in store labor planning in the latter half of fiscal have resulted in lower store payroll as a percentage of net retail sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal we maintained the lower level of store payroll as a percentage of sales in fiscal  and anticipate maintaining that level in the future 
other store expenses such as credit card fees and supplies historically have increased or decreased proportionately with net retail sales 
we granted options during fiscal at an exercise price of per share  which had been determined to be the fair value of our common stock at the time based on an independent appraisal 
subsequent to such grants  we determined that the fair value of the underlying common stock should have been deemed to be approximately per share 
as a result of this determination  this option issuance generated stock based compensation of million to be recognized over the vesting period of the  underlying options issued 
these options became fully vested upon the completion of our initial public offering on october  accordingly  all unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was recognized at that time and is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
on january   we plan to adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised 
table of contents  share based payment sfas r 
the provisions of sfas r require that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas r requires the recognition of compensation expense related to instruments issued following adoption as well as to the non vested portion of instruments issued prior to adoption of the standard 
after the adoption of sfas r  we anticipate that our share based employee compensation will primarily consist of the granting of non vested stock which vests over a pre determined period of time assuming continued employment 
in the past  our share based employee compensation consisted primarily of stock option awards which vested over a pre determined period of time assuming continued employment 
we expect to report stock based compensation of approximately million million net of taxes  in fiscal following the adoption of sfas r 
on october   we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options which were granted prior to march  these options have exercise prices ranging from to per share 
options to purchase  shares of our stock became exercisable on october  as a result of this acceleration  including  shares held by our named executive officers 
of these options   had exercise prices in excess of the current market value at the time of the acceleration of vesting 
our decision to accelerate the vesting of the accelerated options was based upon the issuance by the financial accounting standards board of sfas r  which will require us to record compensation expense for unvested stock options effective january  the acceleration of the vesting of these stock options will enable us to avoid compensation charges related to these options in subsequent periods under the provisions of sfas r 
in addition  we considered that because the vast majority of these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value  they were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention 
accordingly  we believed that the acceleration would have a positive effect on employee morale 
the aggregate compensation expense that would have been recorded subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  but was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options  was approximately million million net of tax 
this amount is instead reflected in the pro forma footnote disclosures set forth in note t to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
store preopening preopening costs are expensed as incurred and include store set up  certain labor and hiring costs  and rental charges incurred prior to a store s opening 
impairment charge credit this includes the provision to write down to estimated net realizable value the long lived assets of any store for which we have determined the carrying value will not be recovered through cash flows from future operations 
the credit relates to the reversal of certain store closing costs following the decision to continue operations at a location previously designated for closure 
expansion and growth potential us and canadian stores the number of build a bear workshop stores in the united states and canada for the last three fiscal years can be summarized as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal beginning of period opened closed end of period in fiscal  we anticipate opening approximately build a bear workshop stores in the united states and canada 
we believe there is a market potential for approximately build a bear workshop stores in the united states and canada 
in fiscal  we began testing in certain markets our initial brand expansion initiative  our proprietary friends b made line of make your own dolls and related products 
in fiscal  we opened two friends b made locations in or adjacent to existing build a bear workshop stores 
in fiscal  we opened three additional locations in or adjacent to new or existing build a bear workshop stores 
these friends b made stores are not included in the number of store openings in fiscal or as noted above but rather are considered expansions of build a bear workshop stores 
the friends b made merchandise is also offered from a separate display fixture in select build a bear workshop stores 
non store locations 
table of contents in we began offering merchandise in seasonal  event based locations such as citizens bank park  home of the philadelphia phillies baseball club  as well as at temporary locations such as at the nba all star jam session 
we expect to expand our future presence at select seasonal  event based locations contingent on their availability 
in fiscal  we opened two additional event based locations in baseball ballparks  and we plan to open two additional locations in baseball ballparks in fiscal we also plan to open our first store within a zoo during fiscal international franchise revenue our first franchisee location was opened in november the number of international  franchised stores opened and closed since that time can be summarized as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal beginning of period opened closed end of period as of december   we had master franchise agreements  which typically grant franchise rights for a particular country or countries  with nine franchisees covering thirteen countries 
we anticipate signing additional master franchise agreements in the future 
we expect our current and future franchisees to open approximately stores in fiscal we believe there is a market potential for approximately franchised stores outside of the united states and canada 
on march   we entered into definitive agreements to acquire amsbra limited amsbra  our franchisee in the united kingdom  and the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom 
amsbra owns all of the franchised build a bear workshop stores located in the united kingdom 
the transactions  which are subject to regulatory approval in the united kingdom  are expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of fiscal if the transactions close  as expected  all of the franchised locations in the united kingdom will become company owned stores 
eleven of the franchised locations as of december  were operated by amsbra 
licensing revenue in fiscal  we began entering into license agreements pursuant to which we receive royalties on build a bear workshop brand products 
these agreements generated revenue of approximately million in fiscal we anticipate entering into additional license agreements in the future

store contribution consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our webstore and seasonal and event based locations 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use store contribution as a measure of our stores operating performance 
store contribution should not be considered a substitute for net income  net income per store  cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows provided by operating activities per store  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe store contribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it  along with the number of stores in operation  directly impacts our profitability 
historically  central office general and administrative expenses and preopening expenses have increased at a rate less than our total net retail sales increases 
therefore  as we have opened additional new stores and leveraged our central office general and administrative and preopening expenses over this larger store base and sales volume  we have been able to increase our net income each year 

table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of store contribution to net income fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands net income income tax expense interest expense income store depreciation and amortization store preopening expense general and administrative expense franchising and licensing contribution non store activity contribution store contribution total revenues franchising and licensing revenues revenues from non store activities store location net retail sales store contribution as a percentage of store location net retail sales total net income as a percentage of total revenues store depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of all capitalized assets in store locations  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer hardware and software

table of contents the results of this quarter include what we believe is the positive impact of being featured in one segment of a nationally syndicated television show 
gross margin represents net retail sales less cost of merchandise sold 
amounts presented in the above table are different than those previously presented on form q due to certain reclassifications made to comply with the current period presentation 
our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods  and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors  including those discussed under risk factors fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to substantially decline 
the timing of new store openings may result in fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each new store location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a new store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening 
we expect our growth  operating results and profitability to depend in some degree on our ability to increase our number of stores 
historically  for stores open more than twelve months  seasonality has not been a significant factor in our results of operations  although we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case 
in addition  for accounting purposes  the quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks  although we will have a week quarter approximately once every six years  including the quarter ended january  quarterly fluctuations and seasonality may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the opening of new stores  information systems and working capital 
historically  we have met these requirements through capital generated from the sale and issuance of our securities to private investors and through our initial public offering  cash flow provided by operations and our revolving line of credit 
from our inception to december  we raised at various times a total of million in capital from several private investors 
in  we raised million from the initial public offering of our common stock 
since fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities have exceeded cash flows used in investing activities 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities increased each period primarily due to increases in net income adjusted for the impact of depreciation and amortization 
changes in assets and liabilities  excluding cash  provided cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increases in operating cash flows for changes in assets and liabilities  excluding cash  for the fiscal years through were primarily due to increases in gift cards  due to the significant sale of gift cards in december each year  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the growth of the number of stores in operation at each year end and higher accruals for corporate bonuses at the end of fiscal  and increases in the deferred revenue and deferred rent balances due to growth in net retail sales and the number of stores in operation  respectively 
tax benefits from stock option exercises also provided operating cash flows of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal there were no tax benefits from stock option exercises in fiscal the increases in operating cash flow for the above reasons were partially offset by increases in inventory due to the growth of the number of stores in operation 
we require an increase in working capital  specifically inventory  during the year 
inventory typically peaks during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to the strong selling periods of summer and the month of december 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used in investing activities relates primarily to new stores opened in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in fiscal  a loan made to one of our franchisees used cash of million 
no loans were made in fiscal or fiscal the costs of registering our intellectual property rights and certain costs related to the designing and leasing of stores were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and none in fiscal in fiscal  exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchases provided cash of million  as compared to million in fiscal and none in fiscal the collection of a note receivable from an officer of the company provided cash of million in fiscal a similar note collection in fiscal provided cash of million 
there were no note collections in fiscal in fiscal  we completed our initial public offering which resulted in cash inflows  net of offering costs  of million 
the financing cash inflows from the initial public offering were partially offset by the payment of a special cash dividend in august of million 
maximum borrowings under our line of credit were million in fiscal no borrowings were made under our line of credit in fiscal or capital resources 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million 
we also have a million line of credit  which we can use to finance capital expenditures and seasonal working capital needs throughout the year 
the credit agreement is with us bank  national association 
borrowings under the credit agreement are not collateralized  but availability under the credit 
table of contents agreement can be limited by the lender based on our level of accounts receivable  inventory  and property and equipment 
the credit agreement expires on september  and contains various restrictions on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  redemptions  mergers  acquisitions or sale of assets  loans  transactions with affiliates  and investments 
it also prohibits us from declaring dividends without the bank s prior consent  unless such payment of dividends would not violate any terms of the loan agreement 
borrowings bear interest at the prime rate less 
financial covenants include maintaining a minimum tangible net worth  maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement and not exceeding a maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
there were no borrowings under our line of credit as of december  there was a standby letter of credit of approximately million outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  accordingly  there was approximately million available for borrowing under the line of credit as of december  most of our retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases 
these leases typically have a ten year term and contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on defined sales levels 
many of the leases contain a provision whereby either we or the landlord may terminate the lease after a certain time  typically in the third to fourth year of the lease  if a certain minimum sales volume is not achieved 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters  including rights of termination in some cases 
in fiscal  we expect to spend a total of approximately million to million on capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of a new distribution center and the opening of approximately new stores 
this amount also includes projected capital expenditures for the continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems 
in fiscal  the average investment per new store  which includes leasehold improvements  fixtures  equipment and inventory  was approximately million 
we anticipate the investment per store in fiscal will be approximately the same 
the capital investment in our new distribution center is expected to be approximately million in fiscal on march   we entered into definitive agreements to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited  our uk franchisee 
the total cash purchase price of the two entities is approximately million  exclusive of the professional fees incurred as a part of the transaction 
included within the approximate purchase price is the forgiveness of the million note receivable from amsbra and all related accrued interest 
the transactions are subject to uk regulatory approval  and are expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to spend an additional million to million on capital expenditures related to store re branding and the opening of new stores in the uk in fiscal we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is a possibility that the company may need to seek additional financing to cover seasonal working capital needs  and it is possible that the needed financing will not be available at acceptable rates 
our current credit agreement expires on september  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any arrangements classified as off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include future minimum obligations under operating leases and purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise inventory  construction commitments related to our new distribution center and obligations associated with building out our stores 
the future minimum payments for these obligations as of december  for periods subsequent to this date are as follows payments due by fiscal period as of december  total beyond in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total inflation 
table of contents we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer significant discounts or markdowns  nor have we experienced significant occurrences of obsolete or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes in circumstances  such as changes in guest merchandise preference  could cause reclassification of inventory as obsolete or slow moving inventory 
the effect of this reclassification would be the recording of a reduction in the value of inventory to realizable values 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past historical results 
periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  the timing of the physical inventory has been near the end of the fiscal year so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset  including property and equipment  may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
no long lived assets were impaired in fiscal   or in fiscal  we determined that one store which had been designated for closure would remain open 
this determination resulted in the reversal of million in impairment charges taken in fiscal for costs to be incurred upon the closing of the store 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in additional impairment charges 
revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift certificates are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a frequent shopper program whereby guests who purchase approximately of merchandise receive off a future purchase 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 

table of contents we evaluate the ultimate redemption rate under this program through the use of frequent shopper cards which have an expiration date after which the frequent purchase discount would not have to be honored 
the initial card had no expiration date but has not been provided to our guests since may beginning in june  and continuing each summer thereafter  a new series of cards was issued that had an expiration date of december of the year following the year in which that series of cards was first issued 
we track redemptions of these various cards and use actual redemption rates by card series and historical results to estimate how much revenue to defer 
we review these redemption rates and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue account at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the deferral rate are generally made no more often than bi annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
based on this assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue account was adjusted downward by million with a corresponding increase to net sales 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred beginning in fiscal was decreased by  and by another beginning with the third quarter of fiscal  to give effect to the change in redemption experience 
the changes made to the deferral rate in were prospective in nature with no impact on previously reported results of operations 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  the amount of revenue being deferred was reduced by on a prospective basis from its then current level due to further changes in the company s redemption experience 
a adjustment of the ultimate redemption rate at the end of fiscal for the current cards expiring on december  and december  would have an approximate impact of million on the deferred revenue balance and net retail sales 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial account standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r eliminates the intrinsic value method under apb as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards 
sfas r also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies sfas s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
in addition  sfas r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
sfas r  as amended by a ruling issued by the securities and exchange commission on april   requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchases under certain employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first annual reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we plan to adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
we expect to report stock based compensation expense of approximately million  net of taxes  in fiscal following the adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the provisions of this statement are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of the provisions of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on october   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb has concluded that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period are for the right to control the use of a leased asset and must be recognized as rental expense 
our current accounting policies are in compliance with the conclusion reached in fsp no 
fas the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of the provisions of fsp no 
fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowings 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at a rate of prime less 
we had no borrowings outstanding during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
