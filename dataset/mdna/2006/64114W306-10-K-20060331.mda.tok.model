item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our operations are grouped into four segments software and related systems and services ny software and related systems and services ohio data center services service bureau services application service provider services asp software and related systems and services is the design  installation  implementation and maintenance of computer information systems that provide comprehensive healthcare information technology solutions  including billing  patient tracking and scheduling for inpatient and outpatient environments  as well as clinical documentation and medical record generation and management 
we perform these services in both the new york and ohio segments 
within these segments  we recognize revenue based on the nature of the products and services sold  for example  a turnkey system or a maintenance contract 
turnkey revenue includes turnkey systems labor revenue  third party hardware and software  license revenue and sales from our small turnkey division 
we further classify our revenue into large turnkey and small turnkey components 
the large turnkey components consist mostly of our avatar suite of products 
when we are engaged in fixed price arrangements for large turnkey systems  the installations will usually extend over a six month to a multi year time period 
the duration of the implementation depends on the size and complexity of the customer organization and the specifics of the implementation 
installations of small turnkey components are usually completed within a six month period 
small turnkey contracts performed in the new york segment are mostly related to our avatar methadone related products 
the small turnkey contracts in the ohio segment are for system installations for behavioral healthcare information management software for mental health  substance abuse  and addiction services agencies  developmental disability centers and behavioral health related managed care organizations 
the ohio segment is a new segment established as a result of the acquisition of netsmart ohio  formerly cmhc systems  inc the netsmart ohio operations are included commencing october  data center services involves our personnel performing data entry and data processing services for customers

we have made the required principal and interest payments on the note and the principal amount outstanding at december  is  in the  we capitalized software development costs of  relating to one of our avatar products 
in  we capitalized  related to our rad plus product 
a part of our growth strategy is to acquire other businesses that are related to our current business 
such acquisitions may be made with cash  our securities  or a combination of cash and securities 
if we fail to make any acquisitions our future growth will be limited to only internal growth 
we are continually seeking acquisitions that will add complementary products to our offerings and that will provide value for the markets we serve 
as of the date of this form k annual report  we did not have any formal or informal agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
based on our outstanding contracts and our continuing business  we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash on hand will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
it is possible that we may need additional funding if we go forward with certain acquisitions or if our business does not develop as we anticipate  or if our expenses  including our software development costs relating to our expansion of our product line and our marketing costs for seeking to expand the market for our products and services to include smaller clinics and facilities and sole group practitioners  exceed our expectations 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
among other things  estimates are used in accounting for allowances for bad debts  deferred income taxes  expected realizable values of assets primarily capitalized software development costs and customer lists and revenue recognition 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
following is a discussion of the significant accounting policies and the significant estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition capitalized software development costs impairment of customer lists bad debts fair value of acquired deferred post contract customer support valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets purchase price allocation of netsmart ohio acquisition liquidated damages of registration rights agreement revenue recognition the company recognizes large turnkey revenue from long term six months or longer  fixed price contracts for financial statement purposes under the percentage of completion method when significant modification of the software package is required to meet the customer specifications 
the percentage of completion method takes into account progress towards completion of a contract using time spent by technical personnel on a particular project as the measuring standard 
revisions in cost estimates and recognition of losses on these contracts are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts become known 
contract terms provide for billing schedules that differ from revenue recognition and give rise to costs and estimated profits in excess of billings  and billings in excess of costs and estimated profits 
the company recognizes small turnkey revenue from short term less than six months  fixed price contracts for financial statement purposes under the completed contract method 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until earned and represented as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet 
revenue associated with fixed price turnkey sales consists of the following components licensing of software  labor associated with the installation and implementation of the software  and maintenance services rendered in connection with such licensing activities 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
maintenance contract revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective contract 
we also derive revenue from the sale of third party hardware and software which is recognized based upon the terms of each contract 
consulting revenue is recognized when the services are rendered 
data center revenue and application service provider revenue are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
the above sources of revenue are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
contract terms often provide for billing schedules that differ from revenue recognition and give rise to costs and estimated profits in excess of billings  and billings in excess of costs and estimated profits 
deferred revenue represents revenue billed and collected but not yet earned 
the cost of maintenance revenue  which consists solely of staff payroll and applicable overhead  is expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and ends upon its availability for general release to customers 
technological feasibility for our computer software products is generally based upon achievement of a detail program design free of high risk development issues 
we capitalize only those costs directly attributable to the development of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology 
prior to reaching technological feasibility these costs are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintenance 
activities undertaken after the products are available for general release to customers to correct errors or keep the product updated are expensed as incurred and included in research  development and maintenance 
amortization of capitalized computer software development costs commences when the related products become available for general release to customers 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis 
the annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenue for a product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
the estimated life of these products range from to years 
we periodically perform reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
impairment of customer lists pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets for financial impairment  and continue to evaluate them as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
our practice is to specifically identify clients and invoices where we believe collection may be at risk and provide for these on a current basis
