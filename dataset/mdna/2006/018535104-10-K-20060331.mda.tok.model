the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the specific allowance for impaired credits  the general allowance based on relevant risk factors  and an amount based on historical losses 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for loans identified for impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral 
these factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
when impairment is identified  a specific reserve is established based on bankshares calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan 
large groups of smaller balance  homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  bankshares does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment testing unless loans become days or more past due 
the general allowance is determined by aggregating un criticized loans non classified loans and loans identified for impairment testing for which no impairment was identified by loan type based on common purpose  collateral  repayment source or other credit characteristics 
we then apply allowance factors which in the judgment of management represent the expected losses over the life of the loans 
in determining those factors  we consider the following i delinquencies and overall risk ratings  ii loss history  iii trends in volume and terms of loans  iv effects of changes in lending policy  v the experience and depth of the borrowers management  vi national and local economic trends  vii concentrations of credit by individual credit size and by class of loans  viii quality of loan review system and ix the effect of external factors eg  competition and regulatory requirements 
this is the largest component of the overall allowance 
the portion based on historical losses is the smallest component of the total allowance for loan loss 
actual realized losses have been nominal since the inception of the bank and were insignificant in goodwill bankshares adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
based on the results of these tests  bankshares concluded that there was no impairment and no write downs were recorded 
additionally  under sfas  acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful life 
the costs of other intangible assets  based on independent valuation  are being amortized over their estimated lives not to exceed fifteen years

the increase is primarily attributable to the substantial increase in net earning assets  and the growth of our loan portfolio 
the following table illustrates average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and related income  expense and corresponding weighted average yields and rates 
the average balances used in these tables and other statistical data were calculated using daily average balances

the bank had nonaccruing loans of  and thousand in  and respectively 
interest spread is the average yield earned on earning assets  less the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the average yield on loans increased from in to in our fixed rate term loans generally use a three or five year treasury security as the base index for the customer rate 
the net interest income earned  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  grew from million in to million in  an increase of 
average loan balances were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the related interest income from loans was million in  an increase of million over the levels 
these increases reflect the strong growth we have experienced in our loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans increased to in  up basis points compared to the same period in investment securities income of million on a fully taxable equivalent basis brought our net interest income level to million on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis over the level of million 
the tax equivalent yields on investment securities for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decline in the investment portfolio is a result of strategic initiatives undertaken to reduce the weighted average life and duration of the investment portfolio

at december   alliance bank had a single loan that was on nonaccrual status totaling thousand compared to no nonaccrual loans at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of loans outstanding  compared to million or of loans outstanding  at december  these ratios exclude loans held for sale 
in  we had net charge offs of thousand compared to thousand in and thousand since inception in as of december   we had loans to five borrowers that were recorded as special mention and substandard on our internal loan watch list 
these impaired loans amount to million 
we have allocated a thousand of our allowance for loan losses towards these specific loans 
this compares to an impaired loan balance of million as of december  the allowance for loan losses as of december  included a specific allocation for the impaired loans of thousand 
the allowance for loan losses was of net loans  or million  at december   and of net loans  or million at december  net charge offs were thousand in  compared to thousand in as part of our routine credit administration process  we engage an outside consulting firm to review our loan portfolio periodically 
the information from these reviews is used to monitor individual loans as well as to evaluate the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent days or more 
we closely monitor individual loans  and relationship officers are charged with working with customers to resolve potential credit issues in a timely manner with minimum exposure to us 
we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by alliance bank and general economic conditions 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period  management takes into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by the organization  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing loans 
after charging off all known losses which have been incurred in the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover its estimate of probable losses

however  management does not believe that the allowance for loan losses can be fragmented by category with any precision that would be useful to investors 
the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses is based primarily upon those factors discussed above in computing the allowance for loan losses as a whole 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the breakdown is not necessarily indicative of the category of future loan losses

in  we established our mortgage banking subsidiary  alliance home funding  llc 
as part of our business strategy to offer complementary services to clients while minimizing risk  generally all loans originated by alliance home funding are presold to correspondent lenders 
as of december   million of loans held for sale were part of our asset base  as compared to million at december  our business objective includes having the loans sold  shipped and funded within a day period 
investment securities we generally classify investment securities as available for sale under the classifications outlined in fasb statement no 
in all periods presented  we had a single investment of  classified as held to maturity 
we use the portfolio to manage excess liquidity  customer deposit volatility and asset liability mix 
investment securities available for sale were million as of december   an increase of million over the december  level of million 
the growth in the investment security portfolio is directly related to the growth in deposits experienced in the effects of unrealized losses on the portfolio were million at december  and million at december  the unrealized losses amounted to of the investment portfolio value as of december  and of the investment portfolio value as of december  our investment portfolio at december  and contained callable us agency securities  us agency collateralized mortgage obligations  us agency mortgage backed securities  state and municipal bonds  federal reserve bank stock  federal home loan bank stock and other securities 
our basic investment philosophy includes investments that provide stable cash flows  municipal securities and callable securities 
according to our policy  the investment portfolio may contain corporate debt securities 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt securities at december  or december  we actively manage our portfolio duration and composition with the changing market conditions and changes in balance sheet risk management needs 
additionally  the securities are pledged as collateral for certain borrowing transactions and repurchase agreements 
contractual maturities of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are not reliable indicators of their expected life because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay mortgages at any time 
we generally expect theses securities to prepay prior to contractual maturity 
additionally  callable agency securities may be called by the issuer prior to the contractual maturity 
in we developed and implemented an investment strategy focused on three key prongs 
the first prong focused on managing the base duration of the callable bond portions of the portfolio 
the second prong focused on expanding the cash flowing portion of the investment portfolio 
the final prong focused on managing the municipal bond or higher yielding portion of the portfolio 
all of the strategies were undertaken within the context of the overall balance sheet and the then current investment portfolio and the overall investment market conditions 
this remains our current strategy today  and the following paragraphs describe these prongs in detail 
base duration management as we entered  we embarked on an investment strategy for the agency sector of minimum reinvestment and to let the balance of this sector mature  be called or sold 
the remaining portion of this sector provides a stable base within the investment portfolio 
we generally felt interest rates would be flat to rising in the future and  as such  our investment activity was geared to a different product which would have shorter cash flow characteristics 
the agency sector of the portfolio declined from in to as of december  the december  agency portfolio was million with a weighted average yield of and a weighted average life of years 
this compares to the december  level of million with a weighed average yield of and a weighted average life of years 
cashflowing instruments the second prong of the investment strategy was to maximize monthly cash flow 
as previously stated the economic conditions in and beyond have generally favored cashflowing investments 
this type of investment allows the organization to have liquidity in most economic times 
our current interest rate bias in is for rising interest rates 
as such we have developed an investment portfolio composed of a variety of cashflowing bonds 
we currently own us agency mortgage backed securities  us agency cmos and private label cmos 
the instruments have varying maturity and coupon characteristics 
we own year balloons  year mbs  year mbs  year mbs  gnma hybrid arms  agency cmos with locked out positions  agency cmos that are presently in the cash flow windows 
in addition  we own private label cmos with varying issuers and aaa ratings along with varying coupons 
the diversified nature of this portion of the investment portfolio is expected to provide cash flow or interest rate repricing in most economic cycles 
as of december   these instruments amounted to million with a weighted average yield of and a weighted average life of years 
portfolio yield the third prong of the investment strategy is based on investment yield performance 
we generally invest in aaa insured bank qualified municipal bonds 
this portion of the investment portfolio is invested on a longer duration basis 
we own instruments with maturities ranging from to many of the instruments have call features which would allow the issuer to redeem the bonds prior to final maturity 
the december  municipal portfolio was million with a weighted average tax equivalent yield of and a weighted average life of years 
this compares to the december  level of million with a weighed average yield of and a weighted average life of years 
the overall investment portfolio had a base case duration of years as of december  if interest rates rise the base case duration extends to years or very similar to the duration of a year us treasury security which has a duration of years 
the investment portfolio is modeled on an instrument level basis for portfolio management purposes 
in addition  the investment portfolio is modeled on a detailed basis within the nii and eve alm models 
the performance of the investment portfolio in the interest rate shock tests is considered as part of the overall balance sheet management process and appropriate alm strategies are developed and implemented accordingly 
investment securities available for sale amounted to million at december   a million increase over the december  level of million

non interest income the following table highlights the major components of non interest income for the periods referenced year ended december  dollars in thousands gain on loan sales net gain on sale of securities net gain on trading activities deposit account service charges other total the primary source of non interest income is gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans 
gains from sales of mortgage loans were million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million over the million level in the mortgage banking activity and performance has a correlation to interest rates 
as interest rates rise home buyers may elect to finance homes with adjustable mortgage products or  if rates rise significantly  defer a home purchase 
the volatility in interest rates could result in slower mortgage production or lower levels of mortgage banking income 
the loss of key employees may also affect production 
during the fourth quarter of  several staffing changes occurred 
we also hired additional staff to help keep pace with the changing growth of alliance home funding 
during the transition period production was low  leading to the decrease in gain on loan sales 
in the year ended december   we had a net loss of thousand on the sale of investment securities 
this represents a decrease of thousand over the level net gains of thousand 
during  we reallocated our investment portfolio to manage the high levels of actual and projected prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
in addition to managing the mortgage related investments  a variety of agency and municipal securities were sold 
the repositioning of the portfolio generated a larger level of securities gains than we routinely experience in the ordinary course of business 
we have separately disclosed net gains from securities held for a short period of time for the pair off of certain mortgage backed securities transactions 
for the year ended december  we had no net gains on trading activities  compared to thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
routine banking fees such as account maintenance  insufficient funds  online banking  stop payment  and wire transfer fees amounted to thousand  thousand and thousand  for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
our other non interest income is predominately from atm fees 
this type of fee income is a modest activity for alliance bank 
our gains on mortgage loan sales amounted to million during the year ended december  this represented a thousand decrease over the level of million 
as part of our routine balance sheet management strategy  a variety of investment securities were sold in the repositioning along with some pair off transactions resulted in gains of thousand during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  non interest expense non interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to the level of million 
salary and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to the december  level of million 
the increase results from commissions and incentives paid on mortgage banking production as well as new personnel in alliance bank 
total salary and benefits expense for alliance home funding amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  occupancy and furniture and equipment costs were up thousand in from the level of million 
the change in occupancy expense is directly related to opening branches and offices

non interest expense for amounted to million  compared to the level of million 
the increase is directly related to our expansion activities 
the largest component of non interest expense is salaries and benefits 
salary and benefits expenses in were million  or thousand higher than the level of million 
as a growing organization  we expanded our retail  commercial and private banking staffs to meet growth and profitability targets 
additionally  the salaries  commissions and benefits associated with alliance home funding contributed to the growth in salaries and other non interest expense 
occupancy and furniture and equipment costs in were up thousand over the level of million 
other operating expenses amounted to million in  compared to million in the costs associated with opening these locations increased our other operating expenses due to marketing and general branch openings programs 
in addition  our professional fees rose due to costs incurred in the establishment of the holding company 
the components of other operating expenses for the periods referenced were as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands business development office expense bank operations expense data processing professional fees other total income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax expense of thousand in our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to the benefits of our municipal bond portfolio 
deposits we have made a special effort to obtain deposits from title and mortgage loan closing companies  which generally provide a good source of non interest bearing deposits 
we have developed products and services using available technology that meet the needs of these customers 
the balances on deposit with us tend to fluctuate greatly during any given month  depending on transaction scheduling and overall market conditions 
these balances represent a substantial portion of our non interest bearing deposits 
these deposits are subject to significant reduction during slow real estate markets 
in order to meet the withdrawal needs of these customers  we monitor our liquidity  investment securities and lines of credit on a constant basis 
we have sold and will in the future sell investment securities as a source of liquidity 
we seek deposits within our market area by paying competitive interest rates  offering high quality customer service and using technology to deliver deposit services effectively 
at december   the deposit portfolio was million  a million increase over the december  level of million 
we have seen growth in several key categories over the periods compared 
key deposit categories  such as now  money market and certificates of deposit have all grown in proportion to overall company growth 
the effects of several deposit gathering and branching initiatives have allowed our deposit and customer base to continually expand 
from time to time  we gather time deposits from the wholesale marketplace 
brokered certificates of deposit allow us to fund loan and investment growth with minimal sales efforts 
at december   we had million in such deposits 
the balance of the million consists of two types of brokered deposits 
at december   we had million of brokered deposits that relate to a state government program and million of brokered deposits that are part of a periodic marketing program by a licensed broker on our behalf 
we entered into a series of brokered deposits during as part of a corporate initiative to extend the maturity of liabilities 
the certificates issued as part of the brokered deposit program have maturities ranging from one to three years from issuance 
this type of funding is an excellent tool to support the growth of our mortgage banking unit  alliance home funding 
as market conditions warrant and balance sheet needs dictate  we may continue to participate in the wholesale certificates of deposit market 
as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer and or broker 
at december   deposits were million  a million increase over the december  level of million

we do not have any open repurchase agreements with broker dealers 
liquidity our overall asset liability strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth and deposit runoff 
our liquidity is impacted by the general growth of alliance bank  growth of alliance home funding  the national and local mortgage refinance market and the investment portfolio 
we use a variety of tools to manage our liquidity 
these include pricing on loans and deposits  purchase or sale of investments  brokered deposits  the sale or participation of loans  and rates and fees on home mortgages 
in addition  we have a variety of credit facilities at our disposal 
our funding department monitors our overall position daily 
we can and will draw upon federal funds lines with correspondent banks  reverse repurchase agreement lines with correspondent banks and use fhlb advances 
our deposit customers frequently have lower deposit balances in the middle of each month 
the deposit balances generally rise toward the end of each month 
as such  we use wholesale funding techniques to support our overall balance sheet growth 
our liquidity is directly impacted by alliance home funding 
as interest rates decline  mortgage refinances and home purchases increase 
in addition to the impact of interest rate movements  alliance home funding has been adding production personnel which we expect will increase loan originations and funding requirements 
alliance bank provides a warehouse line of credit to alliance home funding 
the funds advanced on this line allow us to originate and hold mortgages until they are sold to third party investors 
in  advances under this line of credit averaged million  compared to million in our general liquidity management activities take into account current and expected warehouse line of credit needs 
in  we expanded our use of brokered deposits as part of our core business growth 
certificates of deposit issued under this program also support the funding needs of alliance home funding as well as general interest rate risk management 
we generally issue these instruments with a maturity of one year or longer 
as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer or broker

off balance sheet activities alliance bankshares  alliance bank  alliance home funding and alliance insurance agency enter into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the overall liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
in mid  we began a project to enhance the sophistication of our current asset liability management alm processes 
we engaged a consulting firm to assist management in developing best practices in the alm process 
a core component of the project is the development of a more in depth alm model that measures net interest income nii and economic value of equity eve results on a monthly basis 
the results indicate that we are positioned well for rising interest rates 
the board of directors has approved nii and eve metrics for policy measurement and as of the most recent model run december  we are in compliance with all policy metrics 
the short term interest rate model nii indicates we are asset sensitive 
the long term model eve indicates a stable to slightly declining eve in a rising interest rate environment 
net interest income sensitivity 
bankshares alm process evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates of future net interest income 
this analysis involves shocking the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of bankshares shorter term interest rate risk 
this process is accomplished by maintaining the balance sheet over a period of time with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under various rate scenarios 
these assumptions might include prepayments  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant by bankshares 
the alm results for december  are shown in the table below 
assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points  the results indicate bankshares would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by 
assuming a shift downward of basis points  bankshares would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by 
the results in both a rising and declining interest rate environment are within the policy guidelines 
economic value of equity 
the economic value process models the cashflows of financial instruments to maturity 
the model incorporates growth and pricing assumptions to develop a baseline eve 
the interest rates used in the model are then shocked for an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the results of the shocked model are compared to the baseline results to determine the percentage change in eve under the various scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
bankshares is in compliance with the board approved eve guidelines in all scenarios 
the table below shows as of december  alm model results under various interest rate shocks december  interest rate shocks nii eve bp bp bp bp interest rate gap 
in addition to the nii and eve models  management reviews our static gap position 
the cumulative negative gap position within one year was million  or of total assets  at december  the negative gap suggests that the net interest margin will decrease in a market of rising interest rates  as liabilities will reprice faster than assets 
while this measurement technique is common in the financial services industry  it has limitations and is not our sole tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
we do not believe this model accurately reflects bankshares true short and long term interest rate exposure 
as an example  million of the investment securities at december  are classified as greater than five years due to the contractual maturity of the instruments 
a significant portion of the securities are expected to provide cash flow within one to two years 
the shifting of the cash flow to a more realistic measurement provides a significantly different picture of the interest sensitivity of the organization

as part of our interest rate risk management  we typically use the investment portfolio to balance our interest rate exposure 
the pricing of deposits is adjusted within the market area to favor money market or certificates of deposit depending on the need for floating or fixed rate liabilities 
the pricing of loan products is a function of interest rate risk management strategies and the market conditions in the area 
in many cases  interest rate risk pricing desires are not consistent with the general market  which requires us to balance our interest rate risk through other products 
an example of this is that in a rising rate environment  the loan customer typically prefers fixed rate loans and banks typically desire floating rate loans 
in this example  we would add floating rate or adjustable securities or price certificates of deposit aggressively to balance the interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity position does not measure the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of our investment securities portfolio 
rising interest rates will cause a decline in the market value of our investment securities 
a decline in the market value of the investment portfolio could make managing the net interest income exposure more difficult 
there is no guarantee that the risk management and balance sheet management strategies we employ will be effective in periods of rapid rate movements 
we believe our strategies are prudent in the base case of our modeling efforts as of december
