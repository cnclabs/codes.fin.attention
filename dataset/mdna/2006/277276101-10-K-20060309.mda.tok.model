item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being the leading provider in its markets of functional  flexible  and high quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company develops  acquires and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt regions 
the company s core markets are in the states of florida  texas  california and arizona 
the company primarily generates revenue by leasing space at its real estate properties 
as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space at competitive market rates 
the company s primary risk is leasing space 
during  leases on  square feet of eastgroup s total square footage of  expired  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of that total 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year

eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a major contributor to the company s growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity

three of these properties are leased and the other is leased 
the company transferred two additional properties to the portfolio in the first quarter of and expects to transfer two more in the second quarter  all of which are leased

tower automotive  inc tower filed for chapter reorganization on february  tower  which leases  square feet from eastgroup under a lease expiring in december  is current with their rental payments to eastgroup through march eastgroup is obligated under a recourse mortgage loan on the property for  as of december  property net operating income for was  for the property occupied by tower 
rental income due for is  with estimated property net operating income for of  eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit s definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the property s performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
real estate income is comprised of rental income  pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of property taxes  insurance  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees  other operating costs and bad debt expense 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered 
the company believes ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents the three fiscal years reconciliations of pnoi and ffo available to common stockholders to net income

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction and lease up  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between gaap in the united states and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
sfas amends apb opinion no 
opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions  which was issued in the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaced it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in sfas are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company s adoption of this statement in june had no impact on its overall financial position or results of operation as the company had no nonmonetary asset exchanges during the periods presented nor does it expect to have nonmonetary asset exchanges in the immediate future 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted this interpretation on december  with no impact to its overall financial position or results of operations 
the fasb has issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
the new fasb rule requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply sfas r as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june   or january  for eastgroup 
early adoption of the statement is encouraged 
the company currently accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas the company has evaluated the potential impact of the adoption of sfas r in and expects such adoption to have an immaterial impact on its overall financial position or results of operation

eastgroup s interest rate under this facility is libor plus  except that it may be lower based upon the competitive bid option in the note the company was first eligible under this facility to exercise its option to solicit competitive bid offers in june 
the line of credit can be expanded by million and has a one year extension at eastgroup s option

this strategy has also reduced the company s exposure to changes in variable floating bank rates as the proceeds from the mortgages were used to reduce short term bank borrowings 
in late november  the company closed a million nonrecourse first mortgage loan secured by five properties 
the note has a fixed interest rate of  a ten year term  and an amortization schedule of years 
the proceeds of the note were used to reduce floating rate bank borrowings

inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long term debt maturities 
this debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has several variable rate bank lines as discussed under liquidity and capital resources

eastgroup has an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate at for the year term 
interest and related fees result in an annual effective interest rate of the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities  as advised by the company s bankers 
as the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by or approximately basis points  interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately  annually 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to the variable interest rate on the company s  tower automotive center recourse mortgage  which is summarized in the table below 
under the swap agreement  the company effectively pays a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
this swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the tower mortgage loan 
changes in the fair value of the swap are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
