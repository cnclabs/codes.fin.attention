item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  in the following discussion  most percentage and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation  as a result  all such figures are approximations 
references to approximations have generally been omitted 
overview and certain trends in connection with distributing a full line of mrop products to meet the needs of manufacturers and other industrial users  we offer our customers a wide range of specialized business process outsourcing services through our fps program that relate to product selection and application and the customer s production processes that affect the utilization and costs of mrop supplies 
we also offer to our customers general sales of mrop products from stock or on a special order non stock basis 
the revenue and cost components  and the overall pricing structures  associated with fps sales and general mrop sales differ in some respects 
as our sales mix shifts in the future  the different pricing structures of our fps and general mrop sales two lines of business may impact our financial results 

table of contents analysis of fps and general mrop revenue cost structures in fps arrangements in which we become the exclusive or primary supplier of a large volume of mrop products to a customer as occurs with a storeroom management contract  we typically include a component for i management fee revenues that is designed to cover our administrative and overhead costs and ii performance based revenues where we share a portion of the cost savings we obtain for our customer the latter  commonly referred to as gain sharing  along with product sales revenues 
these additional revenue sources from fps arrangements will tend to yield higher operating margins relative to general mrop sales involving the same level of product volume due to lower selling and administrative costs 
in addition  we often offer volume discounts on products to the customer as part of the overall fps arrangement  in order to achieve mutually beneficial results for the customer and us 
in fps arrangements where we derive a portion of our revenues from management fees  the mix of product sales versus management fee and gain sharing revenues may cause our gross margin as a percentage of net sales to be higher  even if our product sales are lower 
however  more often than not product discounts yield a lower gross margin from fps sales as product volume increases relative to service and gain sharing revenues 
general mrop customers purchase products at higher rates due to the amount of overhead cost we incur  which results in higher gross margin 
due to our recent increased focus on the middle market sector  we have seen significant growth in arrangements that are smaller in volume and do not include staffing on site 
as a result  our gross margins have slightly increased  as the middle market business uses fewer resources while maintaining relatively lower selling  general and administrative costs 
the additional revenue sources from fps arrangements will tend to increase gross margins if product volume under these arrangements remains the same relative to general mrop sales 
currently  our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales due to increased product volume at lower prices than general mrop sales 
on the other hand however  our fps arrangements yield a higher operating margin than general mrop sales because our selling  general and administrative expenses are significantly lower and more variable in fps arrangements 
at our storeroom management sites  many of our procurement support functions are performed at the customer s facility 
we therefore incur relatively low fixed costs as a percentage of total costs at storeroom management sites in comparison to our general mrop business  which has a higher fixed cost structure due to absorbing of the overhead cost 
in addition  the costs of our associates are billed to our customers at most of our storeroom management sites 
because our selling  general and administrative expenses at storeroom management arrangements are variable  we can control them relative to the volume and activity of the site 
this control over expenses leads to higher operating margins in storeroom management arrangements 
to a lesser extent than with storeroom management arrangements  we have experienced more positive effects in connection with middle market fps services arrangements which require less procurement support 
these arrangements have higher gross margin due to fewer operating costs than the typical storeroom management arrangement 
summary comparison of fps and general mrop sales results the following summary of our sales and gross profit for the past three years reflects the trend we see with respect to the demand for fps services among our mrop customers  which we believe supports our recognition of a similar trend within the industry in general 
our total sales for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  fps sales including sales pursuant to storeroom management arrangements have increased steadily  both in dollar value even as total sales have declined and as a percentage of total sales  as reflected in the following table 
we expect the upward trend in fps sales to continue for the foreseeable future

during the third quarter  we divested of our cardinal machinery business unit  which contributed revenue of million in and million in total fps revenue grew million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of total sales  fps grew from in to in this growth was a result of increasing our sales volume and market share at existing customers 
as of december   there were fps sites  with being storeroom management arrangements 
the total number of fps sites remained the same as december   as lost sites were equally offset with new site implementations during the year  however storeroom management sites increased by six during the year 
revenue per fps site increased by less than million or as compared to  and revenue per storeroom management site decreased million or 
our general mrop revenue declined by million  or  from million in to million in this decline was due to the disposition of our cardinal machinery business unit  which represented million of the decrement 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased from in to in an increase in gross margin was partly due to improved pricing practices during the year  which were delayed due to difficulties with the updates 
the positive impact of updated pricing was more than offset by a million increase in inventory reserve expense  resulting in the slight increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  however  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the overall quantitative increase is primarily attributable to the million of higher accounting expenses we incurred during compared to as a result of sarbanes oxley related fees to prepare section compliance requirements that became applicable at the end of the year 
otherwise  salaries and benefits expense increased million  or  due to higher sales commissions and incentives as well as million associated with an executive severance package 
travel and entertainment expense increased million as a result of higher sales volume 
partially offsetting these increases  and contributing to the decline in such expenses as a percentage of sales  were a decline of million in bad debt expense due to improved management of aged accounts receivable  a gain of million for the sale of property  and a gain of million related to the sale of cardinal machinery 
these two sales also advanced our facilities rationalization program  reducing our existing facilities to as compared to a year ago 
operating income operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was due to the increase in sales volume  which was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as noted above 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decline in interest expense was primarily due to the reduction in our average annual debt balance by million  or 
our average monthly interest rate has increased  however  from at december  to as of december   as the impact of improved borrowing rates under the recent amendment to our credit facility were more than offset by rate increases by the federal reserve 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million from million in to million in  or from an effective tax rate of to  respectively 
the increase reflects a million reduction in our valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets associated with future deductible goodwill amortization and state net operating loss carryforwards in  as explained in note to our financial statements 
that adjustment to our deferred tax asset was a non recurring benefit in the prior year and effectively reduced the tax rate by 
in addition  we experienced an increase in rates due to non deductible losses incurred in in certain international operations 
compared to net sales net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in on a daily sales basis  revenues increased million  or  over the prior year 
total fps sales grew million  or 
table of contents  to million in as compared to as a percentage of total sales  fps sales increased to as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in fps revenues was due to the net increase of fps sites in at december   we had total fps sites  including full storeroom management arrangements 
in addition  increased production levels and our efforts to increase market share resulted in improved sales at existing sites 
our revenue per fps site decreased million or below  and storeroom management revenue per site increased million or 
we also experienced an increase in production levels at many of our general mrop customers  resulting in an increase in general mrop sales of million  or  from million in to million in most of the latter such increase occurred primarily as a result of increased volume at existing accounts 
cost of sales cost of sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased from in to in the greater percentage increase of cost of sales relative to net sales from to was primarily the result of lower gross margins on our general mrop sales 
this amount was partially offset by an incremental million in year end rebates  and a decrease in inventory reserve expense as compared to the prior year 
in addition  approximately of the overall decrease in gross margins was due to the shift in sales mix from general mrop sales towards fps sales as discussed above in overview and certain trends 
as also discussed in that section  our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin than do our general mrop sales  due to lower prices in exchange for the exclusive relationship in these arrangements  while our fps arrangements typically yield a higher operating margin than general mrop sales because our fps sales generally have lower fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily the result of an increase of million in variable selling expenses associated with the higher sales volume  including i salaries  commissions  and additional incentives of million due to improved operating performance  ii increased freight and delivery expense of million  and iii increased travel expenses of million 
these additional expenses were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy expense of million due to our facilities rationalization program  which resulted in facilities at the end of compared to at the end of operating income operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume  which was only partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as noted above 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in the savings in interest expense was attributable to a decrease in the average monthly interest rate under our credit facility between and  as a result of lower libor rates and favorable pricing due to improved operating results  and to a reduction in the average amount of long term debt outstanding during relative to  to million from million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by million from million in to million in  or from to  respectively 
the decrease reflects a million reduction of our valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset associated with future deductible goodwill amortization and state net operating loss carryforwards  as explained in note to our financial statements 
that adjustment to our deferred tax asset was a non recurring benefit 
our effective tax rate for decreased to as compared to due primarily to the reduction in the valuation allowance  which reduced the tax rate by 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources capital availability and requirements at january   our total working capital was million  which included million in cash and cash equivalents 
we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks the credit facility and an aggregate of million of borrowing capacity under that facility 
based upon our asset base and outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  we had borrowing availability of million 
in july  we amended our million credit facility which we originated in december  to extend the term to july  improve our borrowing rate and provide for additional and more flexible capacity 
the credit facility now provides a million credit facility with an accordion option enabling the company to expand the facility to million and extends through july  the new credit facility also reduces the commitment amount on which the company is charged a non use commitment fee 
credit facility may be used for operations and acquisitions  and provides million for swinglines and million for letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either the lead bank s corporate rate or libor  plus applicable margins  as we may select from time to time 
we incur a fee of basis points on the average daily unused capacity during the term 
assets of all our subsidiaries secure the credit facility 
our average annual borrowing rate is currently as of december  financial covenants under our credit facility are required if the monthly average excess availability under the line falls below million 
in such case  the credit facility contains a requirement for fixed charge coverage of our monthly average excess availability was million as of december  the table below outlines our contractual cash obligations  excluding interest  as they come due 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases estimated interest payments total contractual cash obligations our principal ongoing capital requirements at the present time are for servicing our outstanding debt as reflected in the above table  carrying inventory and accounts receivable  and purchasing and upgrading information technology  other equipment and repurchasing our company s stock in accordance with our stock repurchase program 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the use of available capacity under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our obligations set forth above and to fund both our current operations and anticipated internal expansion for at least the current year 
we may consider a strategic acquisition opportunity if presented  in such case  cash financing would probably be necessary  and we would need approval from our current lenders or access to other capital sources in order to do so 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we calculated estimated interest payments for long term  variable rate debt as follows we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios  we typically expect to settle all such interest payments with cash flows from operations 

table of contents analysis of cash flows on an historical basis  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  cash was provided by operations primarily as a result of net earnings 
cash used for accounts receivable was due to increased sales and cash used for inventory was due to increases in certain mrop product lines and to diversified inventories associated with new fps accounts 
this was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by million collection of a note receivable 
in  cash provided by operations was also primarily the result of net earnings 
our increase in sales volume in resulted in more cash used by accounts receivable  however  this was primarily offset by cash provided by accounts payable due to increased purchases to service the increased volume 
when compared to  overall cash flow from operations decreased slightly in  but cash flow from operations in was primarily due to increased net income from increased sales volume and expansion of our business  whereas was primarily a function of working capital management 
our operating cash flows were from earnings and as a result of i our improved working capital management procedures instituted in that affected both accounts receivable and inventory and ii our facilities rationalization and product management programs 
also in  cash was used by accounts payable because we lowered purchases to adjust to current sales levels 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  cash was provided primarily due to the sale of real property during the year which resulted in proceeds of million 
in addition  million was provided by the sale of our cardinal machinery business unit during the third quarter 
partially offsetting these cash inflows was million of cash used to fund capital expenditures in in  we used cash primarily for the purchase of computers and related information technology equipment 
during  we received cash of million  net of closing costs  as a result of the sale of three facilities 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
our primary use of cash for financing activities in was for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility of million  which was partially offset by million in cash borrowed against the credit facility 
we also used million in to repurchase  shares of common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
deferred loan costs associated with the amendment of our credit facility used million in cash in in and  cash was primarily used for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility 
additionally  in  we used million of cash to retire a mortgage associated with the sale of a facility  and million in cash to pay for management liability insurance 
certain accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we have established an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our collection experience and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable based on historical collections experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  a bankruptcy filing or announced insolvency or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
we do not believe our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be adversely affected by any individual customer  since our customers are geographically disbursed and we have no individually significant customers 
the table below depicts our allowance for doubtful accounts  bad debt expense incurred or recovered and write offs during  and the write offs recorded in primarily reflect accounts over two years old that were removed from both our accounts receivable and our allowance for doubtful accounts balances thus having no impact on our earnings 
write offs of accounts receivable have no effect on either our results from operations or cash flows  only expense recoveries impact our earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts dollars in thousands balance at january add charges recoveries to expense  net deduct write offs balance at december percentage of gross receivables inventories slow moving and obsolescence in connection with certain business arrangements  we maintain certain inventories for specific customers needs 
in some of these arrangements  the customers are required to purchase the special inventory at the time that the inventory reaches a certain age 
however  for other customer relationships and inventories  we are not protected from the risk of inventory loss 
in such cases  we rely on available return privileges with vendors  if any 
therefore  in determining the net realizable value of inventories  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories that i are not protected by our customer agreements from risk of loss  and ii are not eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
based upon these factors  we estimate the net realizable value of inventories and record any necessary adjustments as a charge to cost of sales 
if our inventory return privileges were discontinued in the future  or if customers were unable to honor the provisions of certain contracts that protect us from inventory losses  our risk of loss associated with obsolete or slowing moving inventories would increase 
the table below depicts our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory  incurred or recovered  and write offs during  and write offs of inventory have no effect on our earnings  only charges recoveries impact our earnings 
inventory reserve dollars in thousands balance at january add charges recoveries to expense  net deduct write offs balance at december percentage of gross inventory impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate property and equipment for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash 
table of contents flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred income tax assets we have net deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of these net deferred tax assets are the reversal of taxable temporary differences  our forecast of future taxable income  which is based upon estimates and assumptions  and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
on the basis of our operating results and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that our future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we evaluate the realizability and appropriateness of our deferred tax assets and liabilities quarterly and assess the need for any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
during  we determined that the future tax benefits associated with deductible goodwill amortization for tax purposes became fully realizable 
due to the extended reversal period and the uncertainty of projecting future taxable income over this period  the deferred tax asset associated with the goodwill amortization had been fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
we made this determination primarily based on our projections of the future taxable income over the reversal period 
this resulted in a million or per diluted share for the year reduction of the valuation allowance and an associated reduction of income tax expense for the year 
we also reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million or per diluted share for the year for state net operating losses which became fully realizable during the prior year 
in the future  if it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to utilize certain deferred tax benefits that are presently reserved with a valuation allowance  we may adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
in addition  if we experience a decline in earnings in the future  we may have to increase the valuation allowance 
the remaining million balance in the valuation allowance is for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
self insurance and related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to group health  worker s compensation  and casualty losses  subject to an aggregate stop loss limit of million 
we utilize third party administrators to process and administer all related claims 
we accrue an estimate for incurred but not reported claims and related expenses based upon historical experience 
the accrual for incurred but not reported claims relating to group health  worker s compensation  and casualty losses totaled approximately million at december  and december  the accuracy of our accrual for incurred but not reported claims is entirely dependent on future events that are subject to change 
because we are self insured  an increase in the volume frequency or amount severity of claims in the future may cause us to record additional expense that was not estimable at december  we are not aware of any increasing frequency or severity of individual claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposures to market risks are immaterial 
we hold no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  we do not employ any derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments to hedge any market risk  and we have no plans to do so in the future 
to the extent we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  we are exposed to interest rate risk because of the variable interest rate under the facility
