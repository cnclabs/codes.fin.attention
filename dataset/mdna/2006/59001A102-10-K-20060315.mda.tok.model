item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer and builder of single family homes in the rapidly growing western and southern united states based on the number of home closings and revenue 
we focus on providing a broad range of first time  move up  active adult and luxury homes to our targeted customer base 
we believe that the relatively strong population  job and income growth as well as the favorable migration characteristics of our markets will continue to provide significant long term growth opportunities for us 
at december   we were actively selling homes in communities  with base prices ranging from  to  we achieved record home closings  home sales  revenues and net earnings in home closing revenue increased in to billion and net earnings increased to million 
in we closed  homes  up from and we received  new orders for homes  up from for the year ended december   we benefited in most of our markets from strong order demand and strong pricing power  which resulted in record orders  closings and backlog 
our ability to obtain price increases  which have exceeded increases in land and construction costs  resulted in our gross margin increasing to from in fiscal at december   we had a backlog of  homes with a value of approximately billion 
this backlog gives us good visibility into our projected results over the next few quarters 
the homebuilding industry as a whole has generally benefited over the last few years from strong demand and pricing power 
because of the extended time period to construct homes  ie  from the contracting of raw land through the entitlement process to the construction of homes  strong pricing power has a favorable impact on homebuilders gross margins because the underlying land a significant component of the cost of a home was generally contracted for several years earlier in a lower price environment 
thus  we believe  based on our significant backlog  during the first half of we will be able to continue to achieve relatively strong gross margins  unless we experience an unusually high number of order cancellations or construction costs increase significantly 
looking beyond our backlog  however  a slowing or decline in home sales prices could have an adverse effect on our gross margins because land relating to homes will generally have been contracted for in a comparatively higher price environment 
in addition  our gross margins could be adversely impacted if home price increases do not keep pace with construction cost increases 
we posted strong home order growth in  receiving  new orders valued at billion  increases of and  respectively  compared to we are aware of investor concerns about demand trends 
overall  our sales orders in were strong 
during the fourth quarter of  we noticed a slowdown in some of our markets  in the pace of new orders compared to the abnormal surge in orders in the fourth quarter of  resulting in modest increases in the number of homes ordered of and in the value of those orders 
our nevada and northern california markets posted positive order growth in  with increases of and in the value of home orders  respectively 
our fourth quarter order value for these regions  however  fell year over year and  respectively  reflecting slowing from the unusually robust sales pace seen in previous quarters in the northern california and nevada markets with increases in the number of cancellations 
it is our expectation that price appreciation in our more robust markets will moderate and we expect the home order rate to return to more normal and sustainable levels in and beyond 
during january and february  demand moderated from the previous record breaking pace of sales orders in some of our markets  particularly in northern california and florida  while in texas  our sales orders remain solid and have exceeded our expectations 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced an increase in cancellations from historical levels 
this trend of higher cancellation rates has continued 
we believe our experiences in these markets are consistent with the overall trends in the homebuilding market 
in addition  during the last few months in some of our markets  we began offering our customers increased incentives and discounts as homebuilding markets moderate from the pace experienced by the industry in general during recent years 
if these trends continue or worsen in  we may be required to moderate our previously issued revenue and earnings per share guidance 
our strategy and other recent developments in general  we focus on minimizing land risk by purchasing property only after full entitlements have been obtained and typically begin development or construction immediately after close 
we acquire land primarily through rolling option contracts  allowing us to purchase individual lots as our building needs dictate 
these arrangements allow us to control lot inventory typically on a non recourse basis without incurring the risks of land ownership 
at december   we owned or had options to acquire approximately  housing lots  of which approximately were under rolling option and land purchase contracts 
we believe that the lots we own or have the right to acquire represent an approximate five year supply  and that we are well positioned for future growth 
we have completed eight acquisitions over the last eight years 
our recent acquisitions have provided us with an entry into important new markets 
our acquisition of perma bilt homes provided us entry into the fast growing las vegas market and our january acquisition of citation homes of southern california provided us entry into the los angeles metro area market  which is the second largest single family housing market in the united states 
our acquisition of hancock homes phoenix and our acquisition of hammonds homes dallas  houston and austin have strengthened our positions in our important arizona and texas markets 
in we began start up operations in denver  colorado  and orlando  florida 
we began start up operations in reno  nevada in  and we plan to begin delivering homes there in mid in we significantly expanded our presence in florida through our acquisition of colonial homes in february and our acquisition of greater homes in september colonial homes builds single family homes and condominiums in the ft 
myers naples market and greater homes builds single family homes in the orlando market 
in march  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in addition  we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to the company  after commissions  discounts and fees of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from these transactions to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due in connection with this tender offer and repurchase  we recorded a one time pre tax charge of approximately million for premiums  commissions and expenses associated with the tender offer and the write off of existing offering costs associated with the senior notes  net of the accretion of existing note premiums on the senior notes and taxes 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our inability to accurately estimate stock based compensation  expenses  accruals  or an impairment of real estate or goodwill could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
the estimates and assumptions we make relating to our application of fin r  if not accurate  could result in us incorrectly including  or excluding  certain contractual land acquisition arrangements or investments in unconsolidated entities as variable interest entities in  or from  respectively  our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include real estate real estate is stated at cost  which includes direct construction costs for homes  development period interest and certain common costs that benefit the entire community 
we assess these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill we review the carrying value of goodwill annually 
in evaluating impairment  we base our estimates of fair value on an analysis of selected business acquisitions in the homebuilding industry provided to us by an independent third party 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by the amount a buyer is willing to pay in the current market for a like business 
our reporting units are determined in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
warranty reserves warranty reserves included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty costs for each home closed 
we review the adequacy of warranty reserves based on historical experience and our estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjust these provisions accordingly 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
off balance sheet arrangements we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because the criteria for consolidation set forth in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our investments in unconsolidated entities 
we also enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots from entities  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we analyze these agreements under fin r to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie created as result of these agreements using a model developed by management 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie because we are obligated to absorb the majority of the expected losses  receive the majority of the residual returns  or both  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements

home closing revenue increased to a company record of billion in from billion in the factors primarily leading to this increase were continued strong demand and our ability to raise prices throughout many of our markets 
average selling prices on homes closed rose from to and we benefited from a increase in the number of homes closed in to  from  in additionally  our two acquisitions in florida  though only included in our results for less than one year  accounted for approximately of our increase in home closing revenues in in arizona and nevada  the number of homes closed increased in producing home closing revenue of and million  increases of and  respectively  compared to active selling communities in arizona increased to at december  from at the same time a year ago  supporting the strong closing results for arizona 
the increase in california home closing revenue to million in compared to million in reflects a increase in the number of homes closed and a increase in the average selling price of homes closed 
in a very competitive texas market where we are now expanding our entry level and semi custom luxury offerings in addition to our primary focus on move up homes  we closed  homes for million in home closing revenue  increases of and  respectively 
in florida  as a result of our two acquisitions and the commencement of closings in our orlando start up division  we produced home closing revenue of million on home closings 
with florida being one of the fastest growing states in terms of population growth and permit activity  we expect the number of home closings and associated revenue to increase in with our colonial homes and greater homes divisions having a full year of closing activity 
home closing revenue in increased to billion  compared to billion in contributing to our impressive home closing revenue was beginning with a year end order backlog of million 
additionally  our home closing revenue benefited from a increase in the average sales price of homes closed and a increase in the number of homes closed led by our arizona and california regions where the housing markets were very strong in general 
in  we increased the number of actively selling communities through organic growth as well as our january acquisition of citation homes in the southern california market 
the number of closings in our texas region increased to  in  reflecting somewhat more competitive market conditions 
our arizona region posted a increase in the number of homes closed in to  the increase in arizona is primarily due to the increase in closings of more affordable homes in that market  particularly in our active adult communities  representing a shift in our historical product mix in this market 
the average closing price per home in arizona declined in as a result of this shift in product mix 
our california region  which offers our highest priced homes  posted an increase in the number of homes closed  resulting in an increase in home closing revenue in the increase in home closings in california was primarily due to a generally strong housing market and a increase in actively selling communities 
in nevada  closings were off moderately for because we sold out of several communities faster than anticipated in  before our replacement communities were open for sales 
home orders 
home orders for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include orders contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate of less than of gross sales 
in  we took home orders for  homes  an increase of compared to the  home orders in primarily due to having well designed communities with the right products at the right location and at the right price  coupled with a increase in the number of actively selling communities to at december  a robust housing market in arizona contributed to a increase in the value of home orders in  where we have diversified our product mix with our active adult division  complementing our traditional move up and semi custom luxury communities 
in texas  despite a very competitive market  we experienced solid demand in all of our markets and received orders for  homes valued at million in  increases of and  respectively  compared to  home orders with a value of million in a component to our order increase in texas is our product line expansion into entry level and semi custom luxury homes 
our acquisitions of colonial homes and greater homes in florida provided an additional active selling communities to our portfolio at december   contributing approximately million in home orders including the results of our orlando start up division 
the acquisition of colonial homes also added condominiums and attached product to our product portfolio 
while our nevada and northern california regions posted strong order growth in  increases of and in the value of home orders  respectively  our fourth quarter order value for these regions fell year over year and  respectively  reflecting slowing from the unusually robust sales pace seen in previous quarters in these markets 
we expect home order rates to return to more normal and sustainable levels in we ended the fiscal year with  homes ordered compared to  in  representing a increase in home orders 
our arizona and california regions posted particularly strong results  primarily due to healthy housing markets in both states 
the number of home orders in arizona rose in due to newly opened communities and the diversification of our product offerings to take advantage of emerging demographic trends such as maturing baby boomers in the form of active adult communities 
our active adult communities generated sales orders in  as compared to in in california  sales orders increased in primarily due to an increase in active communities in northern california  the acquisition of citation homes in january and continued strong demand for homes 
during  the number of orders in nevada declined to  reflecting the closing out of a number of communities ahead of their replacements 
during the latter part of  we successfully opened several communities for sales  which is reflected in our impressive sales results for nevada in order backlog 
our backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
our backlog was billion at december   an increase of compared to billion at december  and was comprised of  homes  a increase compared to the year ended december  our homes in backlog at december  reflect an average sales price of  an increase of compared to  at the same time a year ago 
these increases are primarily due to healthy housing markets in many of our markets 
in texas  the number of homes in backlog increased to  from  at december  with an increase of in the value of that backlog to million 
our nevada and arizona regions increased the number of homes in backlog and  respectively  while the value of those homes increased and  respectively 
in california  we had a modest increase in backlog of  reflecting moderating demand in the fourth quarter 
with our start up division in orlando and acquisitions of colonial homes and greater homes during  we ended the year with homes in backlog in florida with a value of million in florida 
as a result of the accelerating order momentum during the second half of  we ended with  homes in backlog  a increase compared to year end  resulting in a dollar backlog of billion for year end  an increase over year end in addition to a increase in the number of homes in order backlog  the increase in dollar backlog was also due to a increase in the average sales price of those homes 
our arizona region more than doubled their number of homes in backlog at the end of compared to  with an increase of 
in california  the number of units and average sales price of the units in backlog increased and  respectively  to units and million  primarily as a result of the increased active selling communities in northern california and also due to the acquisition of citation homes in january our nevada region ended with million in backlog  an increase of over year end  mainly due to a increase in the average selling price of homes in order backlog 
the price increase was primarily due to a strong housing market in nevada represented by our year end order backlog with higher priced selling communities compared to lower priced selling communities for year end in texas  our backlog increased to million at year end from year end  primarily due to an increase in unit orders of 
other operating information years ended december  in thousands home closing gross profit dollars percent of home closing revenue commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total closing revenue provision for income taxes dollars percent of earnings before provision for income taxes home closing gross profit 
home closing gross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings 
cost of home closings include land and lot development costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  impact fees  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
home closing gross profit increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to strong demand and our ability to raise prices in many of our markets  along with increases in average sales prices on homes closed 
the increase also reflected a greater percentage of revenue generated by our california  nevada and florida markets  which have higher average selling prices 
in addition to strong demand and higher average selling prices  we were able to effectively manage our land and construction costs 
our gross margin reflects an overall robust homebuilding environment and is higher than our target range 
in the future  we do not believe homebuilding margins of this level are sustainable and we believe our margins will return to a more normalized level during this time period 
we believe that margin compression could result from a slowing in home sale price increases or decrease in home sale prices  increasing costs of land and building materials and increased incentives offered to homebuyers as the homebuilding market slows and interest rates increase 
home closing gross profit as a percentage of home closing revenue was consistent in and at 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  decreased as a percent of home closing revenue to in from in this decrease was primarily due to the strong housing markets  which reduced the involvement of external real estate agents that result in higher commission costs than our internal sales force 
commissions and other sales costs as a percent of home closing revenue were in  down from in this decrease was primarily the result of our ability to leverage our fixed and semi fixed sales and marketing costs with our increase in home closing revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue in from in as discussed elsewhere  during we completed two significant acquisitions in florida 
these acquisitions  along with our growth in our existing markets  necessitated an expansion of our corporate infrastructure capabilities  such as accounting  internal audit  legal and information technology to prudently manage the growth of the company 
general and administrative costs as a percent of total revenue remained relatively consistent in at of total revenue compared to for loss on extinguishment of debt 
reference is made to the following section titled liquidity and capital resources for a discussion about the million loss on extinguishment of debt charge we incurred relating to our bond refinancing 
income taxes 
income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  generally consistent with in the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable for by approximately million  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  up from in this increase was mainly due to the increase in pre tax earnings in arizona and california  which have higher state tax rates than nevada and texas 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable for by approximately million  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital for the year ended december  were for operating expenses  the acquisitions of colonial homes and greater homes  land purchases  investments in joint ventures  lot development  home construction  the repurchase of common stock  income taxes and interest 
we used a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
in addition  we repurchased million of our senior notes through the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
cash flows during the later stages of a community may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of closings includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
we enter into various option and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
except for our specific performance options  none of these agreements require us to purchase lots 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts 
at december   we had entered into option purchase contracts with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note variable interest entities and consolidated real estate not owned in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on december   we amended our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility to add an accordion feature that will allow meritage to request from time to time an aggregate increase of up to million in the maximum borrowing commitment 
each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request we make 
in addition  any increase in the borrowing capacity pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions  including the absence of an event of default 
at december   million was outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase and other contracts 
after considering our most restrictive bank covenants  our borrowing availability under the bank credit facility was approximately million at december   as determined by borrowing base limitations defined by our agreement with the lending banks 
this credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million plus of net income earned since january  plus of the aggregate net increase in tangible net worth resulting from the sale of capital stock and other equity interests as defined  prohibiting our ratio of indebtedness including accrued expenses to tangible net worth from being greater than to  requiring us to maintain a ratio of ebitda including interest amortized to cost of sales to interest incurred as defined of at least to  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced to exceed of tangible net worth and prohibiting the net book value of our raw land where grading or infrastructure improvements have not begun to exceed of tangible net worth  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter as follows unsold homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and model homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and prohibiting us from entering into any sale and leaseback transaction  excluding the sale and leaseback of model homes and prohibiting us from creating or incurring any off balance sheet liability 
for purposes of our credit facility  off balance sheet liabilities include certain liabilities arising under asset securitization transactions  monetary obligations under synthetic leases  tax retention or off balance sheet lease transactions that upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness  any other monetary obligation with respect to any transaction which upon the application of any debtor relief law to us would be characterized as indebtedness or which is the functional equivalent of or takes the place of borrowing but which does not constitute a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
notwithstanding the above  our credit facility specifically provides that liabilities i under rolling options and similar contracts for the acquisition of real property  ii arising under model home leases  and iii arising under guarantees shall not be deemed off balance sheet liabilities 
in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due approximately million of this amount was used to pay down our senior unsecured credit facility 
the indenture for our senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facility  most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  non recourse indebtedness and other indebtedness up to million  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
in march  we completed a series of refinancing transactions that we believe enhanced our liquidity and  in the long term  will result in significant cash interest savings 
these transactions included the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million and the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indenture that governs our existing senior notes  except that  among other things  the new indenture does not require us to maintain a certain level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness and non recourse and other indebtedness is unlimited  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the new indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the new senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
we used the proceeds from these refinancing transactions to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due in connection with this tender offer and repurchase  we reported in fiscal a one time pre tax charge of approximately million for premiums  commissions and expenses associated with the tender offer and the write off of existing offering costs associated with the senior notes  net of the accretion of existing note premiums on the senior notes and taxes 
approximately million of the senior notes remain outstanding as of december  as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior note covenants 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand and anticipated net cash flows from operations are and will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we believe our future cash needs will include funds for the completion of projects that are underway  the maintenance of our day to day operations  and the acquisition or start up of additional homebuilding operations  should the opportunities arise 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 
in august  the board of directors approved a stock buyback program  authorizing the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had purchased  shares under this program at an average price of 
the program was completed in february  with the repurchase of  shares at an average price of in february  the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program  authorizing the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
there is no stated expiration date for this program 
we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this program 
off balance sheet arrangements we often acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements 
this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development 
under these purchase agreements  we are usually required to make deposits in the form of cash or a letter of credit  which may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement 
at december   we had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion and had made deposits of approximately million in the form of cash and approximately million in letters of credit 
we also enter into land acquisition and development joint ventures 
we believe our participation in such joint ventures provides us a means of accessing larger parcels and lot positions and helps us expand our market opportunities and manage our risk profile 
our participation in joint ventures is an increasingly important part of our business model and we expect it to continue to increase in the future 
we and or our joint venture partners occasionally provide limited repayment guarantees on a pro rata basis on debt of certain unconsolidated land acquisition and development joint ventures 
at december   we had limited repayment guarantees of million 
in addition  we and or our joint venture partners occasionally provide guarantees that are only applicable if and when the joint venture directly  or indirectly through agreement with its joint venture partners or other third parties  causes the joint venture to voluntarily file a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action commonly referred to as bad boy guarantees 
these types of guarantees typically are on a pro rata basis and are designed to protect the secured lender from the joint venture filing voluntary bankruptcy to impede the lender s remedies with respect to its mortgage or other secured lien on the joint venture s underlying property 
to date  no such guarantees have been invoked and we believe it is unlikely that such a guarantee would be invoked in the future as it would generally require us to voluntarily take actions that would generally be disadvantageous to the joint venture and to us 
at december   we had outstanding guarantees of this type totaling approximately million 
by definition  guarantees of this type  unless invoked as described above  are not considered guarantees or indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures 
we and our joint venture partners are also typically obligated to the project lenders to complete land development improvements if the joint venture does not perform the required development 
provided we and the other joint venture partners are in compliance with these completion obligations  the project lenders would be obligated to fund these improvements through any financing commitments available under the applicable joint venture development and construction loans 
in addition  we and our joint venture partners have from time to time provided unsecured environmental indemnities to joint venture project lenders 
in some instances  these indemnities are subject to caps 
these indemnities generally obligate us to reimburse the project lenders only for claims related to environmental matters for which such lenders are held responsible 
as part of our project acquisition due diligence process to determine potential environmental risks  we  or the joint venture entity  generally obtain an independent environmental review from outside consultants 
additionally  we and our joint venture partners have agreed to indemnify third party surety providers with respect to performance bonds issued on behalf of certain of our joint ventures 
if a joint venture does not perform its obligations  the surety bond could be called 
if these surety bonds are called and the joint venture fails to reimburse the surety  we and our joint venture partners would be obligated to indemnify the surety 
these surety indemnity arrangements are generally joint and several obligations with our other joint venture partners 
as of december   we were subject to approximately million of these types of surety bond indemnity arrangements 
none of these bonds have been called to date and we believe it is unlikely that any of these bonds will be called 
we also obtain letters of credit and performance  maintenance  and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies depending on the stage and level of our development activities 
in the event the letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and libor lending rates 
at december   we had million drawn under our revolving credit facility that would be subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes  million in principal of our senior notes and million in principal of our senior notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to refinance such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the year ended december  follows december  for the years ended december  fair value at december  thereafter total dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a variable rate b b d b c b c d average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
b  and million relates to our model home lease program in  and although we have no legal obligation to repay this amount  generally accepted accounting principles require we include this liability and a related asset in our consolidated financial statements 
the lease payments required under this program are based on the outstanding principal amount at approximately of such amount per annum 
c million relates to our revolving credit facility which carries a variable interest rate of libor plus per annum or prime 
d million relates to an acquisition and development loan which carries a variable interest rate of the day libor plus per annum 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
