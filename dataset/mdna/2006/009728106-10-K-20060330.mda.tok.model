item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
the percentages of gross sales  revenue and gross trade receivables attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors for the years ended december  and december  were as follows gross gross accounts gross gross accounts sales revenue receivable sales revenue receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are distributors of our products as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with cardinal and mckesson 
we have also established a fee for service contract with amerisourcebergen  which began in january a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect backorders 
as of december   we had approximately  of products on backorder as compared to approximately  of backorders as of december  this decrease in backorders is due to higher production levels in we anticipate filling all current open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any drug can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and beyond our control 
fda warning letter 
the fda issued a warning letter to us in october following a routine inspection of our decatur manufacturing facility 
an fda warning letter is intended to provide notice to a company of violations of the laws administered by the fda and to elicit voluntary corrective action 
the warning letter cited violations of regulatory requirements identified during the inspection and requested that we take corrective actions 
under the terms of the warning letter  we were unable to obtain any approvals to market new products and government agencies were notified of our non compliant status 
additional fda inspections in  and identified additional and recurring violations resulting in continuance of the warning letter 
during this time  the fda initiated no enforcement action 
since  and in response to the violations cited by the fda  we implemented a comprehensive systematic corrective action plan at our decatur manufacturing facility 
we maintained regular communications with the fda and provided periodic progress reports 

table of contents on december   the fda notified us that we had satisfactorily implemented corrective actions and the fda had determined that our decatur manufacturing facility was in substantial compliance with cgmp regulations 
consequently  the restrictions of the warning letter were removed and we became eligible for new product approvals for products manufactured at our decatur manufacturing facility 
while under the warning letter restrictions from to  our inability to fully utilize the capabilities of the decatur manufacturing facility had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product recalls 
there were no product recalls during or in february  we recalled two products  fluress and fluoracaine  due to container closure integrity problems resulting in leaking containers 
the recall was classified by the fda as a class ii recall  which means that the use of  or exposure to  a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or that the probability of serious health consequences as a result of such use or exposure is remote 
the financial impact of this recall was not material to us as our customers did not hold significant inventories of these products 
in march  as a result of the fda inspections performed from december  to february   we recalled twenty four lots of product produced from the period december to june in one of our production rooms at our decatur manufacturing facility 
the majority of the lots recalled were for third party contract customer products 
subsequent to this decision and after discussions with the fda  eight of the original twenty four lots were exempted from the recall due to medical necessity 
the recall was classified by the fda as a class ii recall 
the financial impact of this recall was not material to us as our customers did not hold significant inventories of these products 
dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
on march   we received a letter from the united states attorney s office  central district of illinois  springfield  illinois  advising us that the dea had referred a matter to that office for a possible civil legal action for alleged violations of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention control act of  usc et 
seq 
comprehensive drug act  and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the alleged violations relate to record keeping and controls surrounding the storage and distribution of controlled substances 
without admitting to any of the allegations  on november   we entered into a civil consent decree with the dea the civil consent decree 
under terms of the civil consent decree  without admitting any of the allegations in the complaint from the dea  we agreed to pay a fine of  upgrade our security system and to remain in substantial compliance with the comprehensive drug act 
if we failed to remain in substantial compliance during the two year period following the entry of the civil consent decree  we  in addition to other possible sanctions  might have been held in contempt of court and ordered to pay an additional  fine 
we completed the upgrades to our security system in and have received no further notice from the dea in connection with the civil consent decree 
the two year compliance period lapsed on november  we were inspected by the dea in february and the dea has not informed us of any further violations 
environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were from external customers located in foreign countries

risk factors 
we have experienced recent operating losses  working capital deficiencies and negative cash flows from operations  and these losses and deficiencies may continue in the future 
our recent operating losses  working capital deficiencies and negative cash flows from operations may continue in the future and there can be no assurance that our financial outlook will improve 
for the years ended december  and  our operating losses were  and  respectively 
we experienced negative cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and of  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our results of operations will improve in the future 
if our results of operations do not improve in the future  an investment in our common stock could be negatively affected 
we have invested significant resources in the development of lyophilization manufacturing capability  and we may not realize the benefit of these efforts and expenditures 

table of contents we are in the process of completing an expansion of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility to add capacity to provide lyophilization manufacturing services  a manufacturing capability we currently do not have 
validation and approval of the lyophilization facility by the fda is anticipated in the second quarter of as of december   we had spent approximately  on the lyophilization expansion and anticipate the need to spend approximately  of additional funds excluding capitalized interest which will primarily be used for testing and validation as the major capital equipment items are currently in place 
in addition  we are working toward the development of an internal anda lyophilized product pipeline 
manufacturing capabilities for lyophilized products are projected to be in place by mid however  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development of lyophilization capability  or that other intervening events will not occur that reduce or eliminate the anticipated benefits from such capability 
for instance  the market for lyophilized products could significantly diminish or be eliminated  or new technological advances could render the lyophilization process obsolete  prior to our entry into the market 
there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits from our significant investment into lyophilization capability at our decatur manufacturing facility  and our failure to do so could significantly limit our ability to grow our business in the future 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales  revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three distributors  amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson  accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations and lead to a violation of debt covenants 
a change in purchasing patterns  inventory levels  increases in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
certain of our directors are subject to conflicts of interest 
dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  our chairman of our board of directors  our chief executive officer from march to december  and a principal shareholder  is affiliated with ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
the kapoor trust has also loaned us  resulting in dr 
kapoor effectively becoming a major creditor of ours as well as a major shareholder 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional capital to grow our business and such funds may not be available to us 
we may require additional funds to grow our business 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us due to our recent financial history 
further  the terms of such additional financing  if obtained  likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may not meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into 
table of contents our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances which may not result in marketable products 
we have entered several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements  license agreements  and a joint venture that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will result in fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such finished dosage form products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate which branded pharmaceuticals are about to come off patent and thus permit us to develop  manufacture and market equivalent generic pharmaceutical products 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than that of branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products that third parties develop may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 

table of contents we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if meritless 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of products manufactured by third parties  including our competitors in some instances 
there can be no assurance that our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of such products will not adversely affect our profit margins or our ability to develop and deliver our products on a timely and competitive basis 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute certain of our products as planned 
no assurance can be made that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key executive officers 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
we are particularly dependent upon dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  chairman of our board of directors  and mr 
arthur s 
przybyl  our chief executive officer 
the inability to attract and retain key executive officers  or the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to attract and retain key personnel to be able to compete successfully 
our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see government regulation 
fda regulations 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
those powers include  but are not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt 
table of contents manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of sterile pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of sterile pharmaceutical products to ensure their sterility 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were previously subject to an fda warning letter which the fda issued to us in october following a routine inspection of our decatur manufacturing facility 
an fda warning letter is intended to provide notice to a company of violations of the laws administered by the fda and to elicit voluntary corrective action 
the warning letter cited violations of regulatory requirements identified during the inspection and requested that we take corrective actions 
under the terms of the warning letter  we were unable to obtain any approvals to market new products and government agencies were notified of our non compliant status 
additional fda inspections in  and identified additional and recurring violations resulting in continuance of the warning letter 
during this time  the fda initiated no enforcement action 
since  and in response to the violations cited by the fda  we implemented a comprehensive systematic corrective action plan at our decatur manufacturing facility 
we maintained regular communications with the fda and provided periodic progress reports 
on december   the fda notified us that we had satisfactorily implemented corrective actions and that the fda had determined that our decatur manufacturing facility was in substantial compliance with cgmp regulations 
consequently  the restrictions of the warning letter were removed and we became eligible for new product approvals for products manufactured at our decatur manufacturing facility 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend indefinitely  our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
while we believe that all of our current pharmaceuticals are lawfully marketed in the united states under current fda enforcement policies or have received the requisite agency approvals for manufacture and sale  such marketing authority is subject to withdrawal by the fda 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of products we market are grandfathered drugs that are permitted to be manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed prior to enactment of relevant sections of the fdc act 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
we are not aware of any current efforts by the fda to change the status of any of our grandfathered products  but there can be no assurance that such initiatives will not occur in the future 
any such change in the status of our grandfathered products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
there were no product recalls in or in february  we recalled two products  fluress and fluoracaine  due to container closure integrity problems resulting in leaking containers 
the recall was classified by the fda as a class ii recall  which means that the use of  or exposure to  a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or that the probability of serious health consequences as a result of such use or exposure is remote 
in march  as a result of the december  to february  fda inspection  we recalled twenty four lots of product produced from the period december to june in one of our production rooms at our decatur manufacturing facility 
the majority of the lots recalled were for third party contract customer products 
subsequent to this decision and after discussions with the fda  eight of the original twenty four lots were exempted from the recall due to medical necessity 
the recall was classified by the fda as a class ii recall 
although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of our products 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  or iii competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or obsoleting those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we registered  shares held by certain of our investors for sale under a registration statement on a form s and a form s filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 
exercise of warrants and the conversion of subordinated debt and preferred stock may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any preferred stock  warrants  options  convertible subordinated debt  or any other convertible securities is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   holders of our convertible securities would receive  shares of our common stock upon conversion and holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the amount of such dilution that may result from the exercise or conversion of the foregoing  however  cannot currently be determined as it would depend on the difference between our common stock price and the price at which such convertible securities were exercised or converted at the time of such exercise or conversion 
for example  on january   all  outstanding shares of our series a participating convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity preferred stock and warrants 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and which result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
the terms of our preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 

table of contents we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding of series a preferred stock and on january   all of those shares  including the related accrued and unpaid dividends  were converted into  shares of common stock 
on december   we had  shares of series b participating convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock outstanding  and  additional shares of preferred stock remained authorized for issuance 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business  and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock 
our obligations to pay dividends on our preferred stock decrease the returns available to our common shareholders 
our series b preferred stock bears cumulative dividends at the rate of 
these dividends are payable in cash  or in our discretion  in additional conversion rights 
if dividends are paid in cash  this decreases our working capital available for operations 
if dividends are paid in additional conversion rights  this results in further dilution of our common shareholders 
in either case  the equity per outstanding common share declines  which can cause a decrease in the value of our common stock

we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
penny stock rules may make buying or selling our common stock difficult 
trading in our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
these rules require that any broker dealer that recommends our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors  must  prior to the sale  make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction 
unless an exception is available  the regulations require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market 
in addition  broker dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements are extensive 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight is required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

item properties 
since august  our headquarters and certain administrative offices  as well as a finished goods warehouse  have been located in leased space at millbrook drive  buffalo grove  illinois 
we lease approximately  square feet 
we own a  square foot facility located on acres of land in decatur  illinois 
this facility is currently used for packaging  distribution  warehousing and office space 
in addition  we own a  square foot manufacturing facility in decatur  illinois 
our decatur facilities support all three of our segments 
we added  square feet to our decatur manufacturing facility to add the ability to provide lyophilization manufacturing services 
however  this lyophilization manufacturing facility still needs to go through validation and approval by the fda  which is anticipated in the second quarter of manufacturing capabilities for lyophilized products are projected to be in place by mid we currently do not need lyophilization capabilities  but such capabilities would give us the capability to manufacture additional products for our contract customers and allow us to pursue other anda products and to internally produce one of our currently outsourced products 
as of december   we had spent approximately  on the lyophilization expansion and anticipate the need to spend approximately  of additional funds excluding capitalized interest  which will be focused primarily on validation testing 
in addition  we are working toward the development of an internal anda lyophilized product pipeline 
our wholly owned subsidiary  akorn new jersey inc also leases approximately  square feet of space in somerset  new jersey 
this space is used for manufacturing  research and development and administrative activities related to our ophthalmic and injectable segments 
we do not have any idle manufacturing facilities  however  the capacity utilization at both our decatur and somerset facilities was approximately and  respectively  during the year ended december  we anticipate improved utilization rates at our decatur facility for in line with the recent fda finding that we are in substantial compliance with cgmp regulations 
we can produce approximately batches per month if our decatur and somerset facilities are all operating at normal capacity 
operating the manufacturing facilities at the reduced level has led to lower gross margins due  in part  to unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs 
our current combined space is considered adequate to accommodate our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future
