the valuation allowance at december   was  an increase of  from the valuation allowance at december  the company is also subject to certain minimum state and local taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it conducts business  which result in a provision for income taxes being recognized on operating losses

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total critical accounting policies management must make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements of the company 
certain of these estimates and assumptions relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements of the company were the most appropriate at that time  although actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different conditions 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a detailed discussion of the various accounting policies of the company 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical since they require subjective or complex judgments that could potentially affect the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the carrying value of its accounts receivable based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific client accounts  which includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific clients 
the company also assesses the carrying value of accounts receivable balances based on other factors  including historical experience with bad debts  client concentrations  the general economic environment  and the aging of such receivables 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce its accounts receivable balance to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
based on the company s estimates  an allowance for doubtful accounts of was established at december   compared to an allowance of at december  a change in the company s assumptions  including the credit worthiness of clients and the default rate on receivables  would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from its current carrying value 
such difference  either positive or negative  would be reflected as a component of the company s sg a expense in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets in assessing the carrying value of its property and equipment and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews such assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including an inability to effectively market and sell new service offerings in which significant investments have been made or a general downturn in one of the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which may subsequently result in an impairment charge 
valuation of goodwill in assessing the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company compared the carrying value of its reporting units to their fair values 
the company is required to test its goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the company s annual testing date is september in accordance with sfas no 
 the company aggregated certain components to arrive at one of its reporting units 
the company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach 
in estimating the fair value of its reporting units  the company had to make various assumptions  including projections of future revenues based on assumed long term growth rates  estimated costs  and the appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used by the company for long term revenue growth and future costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates  and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of the company s routine long range planning process 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill was  at september  based on the use of these assumptions in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  there was no impairment of goodwill as of september   the most recent annual testing date 
a change in the company s assumptions  including lower long term growth rates  higher operating costs  or higher discount rates could cause a change in the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units  and therefore could result in an impairment of goodwill  which would have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
income taxes in assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  the company compared the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to the tax effected projections of its taxable income over future periods in which such assets could be realized 
in estimating its future taxable income  the company had to make various assumptions about its future operating performance 
based on the company s projection of future taxable income  which include the effects of recent operating and tax losses  management believed that it was not more likely than not that the benefit associated with the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
accordingly  a valuation allowance in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  was established to reserve against the carrying value of certain of the company s deferred tax assets 
a change in the company s assumptions  including better operating performance than projected  could result in a change in the amount of deferred tax assets that will be recovered  and therefore could result in a reduction to the valuation allowance established at december  such an adjustment would be reflected as a component of the company s provision for income taxes in the period of the adjustment 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  was issued 
sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period commencing after december  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r in its first quarter of fiscal commencing january   the company will use a binomial lattice model for valuing all share based payments as opposed to using the black scholes option price model  which the company used for the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
the company will treat stock options with graded vesting that are granted after january   as a single grant on which compensation expense will be recognized over the service period as opposed to treating each individual vesting tranche as a separate grant 
the company has elected to use the modified prospective application for the transition upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  which requires compensation expense to be recognized on options granted subsequent to the adoption date as well as on options granted prior to the adoption date for which the requisite service period has not been completed as of december  periods prior to the date that sfas no 
r is adopted are not adjusted under the modified prospective application 
the company estimates that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in recognizing in future periods approximately in compensation expense associated with stock options granted prior to the date of adoption of sfas no 
r for which the requisite service period has not been completed as of december  of this total  the company estimates that approximately will be recognized in the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share since  in addition to recognizing compensation expense on options granted prior to the adoption date  all future grants of stock options will result in the recognition of compensation expense 
in may  sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 was issued and is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and to changes required by accounting pronouncements that do not contain transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles as opposed to including in net income the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principal in the period of adoption  which was the standard under apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the company s financial condition or results of operations is not determinable since sfas no 
only affects the adoption of accounting standards in future periods
