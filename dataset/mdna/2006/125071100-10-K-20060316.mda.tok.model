table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview cdi s operating performance in demonstrated solid momentum as revenues increased from the prior year 
this was due to a number of factors  including a steadily improving economic environment and increasing capital spending by customers in the company s key business verticals 
in addition  key account wins across a broad spectrum of accounts and a growing demand for project outsourcing and staffing services has all four of the company s reporting segments showing improvements in revenues  gross profit  and operating profits in within the business solutions bs segment  revenues increased from due to strong growth in the process industrial vertical p i  which was driven primarily by increased capital spending by customers in the oil  gas  and chemical industries  offset by reductions in the other verticals 
although bs operating results were negatively affected by the gulf coast hurricanes and start up costs associated with major account wins  bs operating profit improved in looking forward  based on expected capital spending  the strong pipeline of new business wins  and continued improvements in productivity  the company anticipates double digit growth in bs segment revenues 
in the uk  the construction industry continues to grow with expansion at heathrow airport  the rail system rebuilding  and new government related projects 
although the uk based anderselite anders segment experienced significant management turnover in which required rebuilding the management infrastructure  anders reported an increase in revenues in operating profit more than doubled due primarily to increased efficiencies and productivity among recruiting and sales personnel and an enhanced web based recruiting methodology 
in addition to the above projects  it is expected that the london olympics will provide opportunities for future growth in anders revenues and operating profit 
the todays staffing todays segment also achieved a double digit increase in revenues in driven by growth in both retail and national accounts 
although gross margin was negatively affected by the ramp up of lower margin national accounts  investments made in hiring sales and recruitment management personnel in improved productivity in the management recruiters international mri segment reported increases in both royalties and staffing services revenue fueled by a strong business environment and low us unemployment in the professional  technical  and managerial segments 
mri has expanded its efforts to support its franchisees pursuit of staffing services  thus causing growth in revenues and a decline in overall gross profit margin 
despite the drop in gross margin  mri s operating profits increased in the double digit growth in cdi s net earnings was due primarily to an increase in revenues and a lower rate of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
operating and administrative expenses  as a percent of revenues  declined to in from in this decline was principally attributable to lower expenses and legal fees associated with resolution of certain litigation  claims and disputes  lower real estate exit costs and continued cost containment measures 
cdi believes that over the past few years  the company has laid a foundation for long term growth by delivering customer focused  cost effective solutions using diverse and highly talented personnel 
the company believes that its momentum has continued to build  its business model is sustainable  and that it has the ability to provide staffing and project outsourcing solutions to a diversified group of customers 
in addition  the company believes it must continue to focus on maintaining effective cost discipline and strong control over its contracting process  managing its working capital  and upgrading its financial reporting systems to comply with sarbanes oxley and business requirements 
internal control over financial reporting in compiling the company s financial results for the fourth quarter ended december   management identified a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting relating to account analysis practices and procedures employed by the company in its period end financial reporting process 
specifically  management identified circumstances in which certain customer accounts receivable balances within its business solutions segment were not being properly analyzed  resulting in an accumulation of accounting errors that were not detected on a timely basis 
the impact of the accounting errors resulted in an overstatement of accounts receivable in the and annual financial statements and the financial statements for interim periods in these errors were corrected in the fourth quarter of and are more fully discussed below and in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has taken a number of actions to remediate the material weakness described above 
specifically  the company has developed and implemented new control processes and procedures over accounts receivable within its business solutions segment to ensure that customer accounts are being analyzed properly and on a timely basis  all identified adjustments are approved and recorded on a timely basis  and all account balances are substantiated by supporting detail 
while the company has implemented remediation plans  the aforementioned material weakness will not be considered 
table of contents remediated until the new internal controls operate for a sufficient period of time  are tested  and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively 
see item a  controls and procedures  in this report 
consolidated results of operations fourth quarter adjustments in compiling the company s results for the quarter ended december   management identified and corrected certain errors that had occurred in previous financial periods 
both revenue and direct margin were reduced by million due to the write down of certain receivables  while expenses were increased by million  thereby reducing pre tax earnings by million 
management has evaluated the qualitative and quantitative impact of these corrections in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and has determined that the effect on the current year and on any previous period is not material to the company s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
the company has recorded the correction of these errors in the fourth quarter of the aforementioned errors resulted in the overstatement of pre tax income to the following segments in the periods indicated in millions business solutions anderselite total nine months ended september  year ended december  year ended december  total versus business strategy cdi s business model is based on three critical elements 
first  cdi believes it is strategically and operationally focused on the needs of its customers 
the company meets the needs of its customers through its ability to recruit diverse and highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  develop cost effective solutions  and manage the implementation of complex projects 
second  cdi believes it has the institutional discipline to generate low to mid teen variable contribution percentage margins on incremental revenue 
during the past several years  the company has implemented organizational and reporting changes in support of its vertical go to market strategy 
third  cdi believes it has the talented employee base to fully execute the business model 
the company has developed more efficient business processes  instituted cost containment measures  and increased productivity 
the company believes its business model is sound and it should be well positioned for growth 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses its performance through various measures  including revenue growth  gross margin  operating profit  return on equity  and cash balances 
in addition  management monitors a number of economic indicators including capital spending by industry  unemployment rates  gdp growth  and interest rate changes 
revenue growth is favorably impacted by external factors such as a strong business environment  an increase in capital spending  and low us unemployment rates 
improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor 
low unemployment rates indicate relatively full employment for the types of employees cdi customers hire on a permanent and contract basis 
internally  cdi s ability to capitalize on opportunities created by economic expansion  its performance on new and existing accounts  new contract and account wins  and the ability to mitigate competitive pricing pressures will affect the company s ability to increase revenue 
gross profits reflect cdi s performance and ability to control costs 
while gross profits can shift as a result of the mix of business  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved profitability 
permanent placement revenue also has an impact on gross margin 
since there are low direct costs associated with permanent placement revenue  increases or decreases in permanent placement revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit margins 
operating profit is used to evaluate the performance of the company and each individual reporting segment 
improvements in operating profit are positively impacted by increases in revenue and gross margins  efficiencies achieved in back office and support services  advances in cdi s technology infrastructure  and other expense containment measures

revenues in three of the four categories of revenue and all four company reporting segments increased in the improvement in consolidated revenues was driven primarily by a strong economic business environment and increased demand in project outsourcing services within bs p i vertical  as a result of significant capital spending by customers within the oil  gas  and chemical industries 
an increase in todays and anders staffing services revenue as investments in sales and recruiting capabilities in contributed to revenue growth 
an improvement in mri s staffing services revenue as management expanded its efforts to support its franchised offices in pursuit of this business 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by declines in bs it services  aerospace  government services  and life sciences verticals 
although the it services vertical was awarded a major preferred supplier contract in july  the ramp up of the contract did not occur until late in the fourth quarter 
staffing services revenue in both the it services and aerospace verticals declined due to strong pricing pressures from customers and competitors 
in addition  the government services vertical experienced a decline in its project outsourcing revenue due to the delayed us federal government funding of a us navy shipbuilding and ship design contract 
the company s consolidated gross profit of million in was higher by million  or  as compared to the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above 
however  the overall gross profit margin fell slightly to from in the prior year due primarily to greater mix of lower margin business in bs  particularly in the it services and government services verticals

higher state unemployment insurance sui rates resulting in higher costs which were not passed on to customers 
adjustments amounting to million in connection with accounting errors that occurred in previous fiscal years that were recorded in the fourth quarter of this impact of the above items was partially offset by improved gross profit and gross profit margin within anders  due primarily to increases in higher margin permanent placement revenues 
consolidated operating and administrative expenses of million in increased million  or  from this increase is due primarily to higher staff salaries and incentive based compensation associated with the revenue growth discussed above 
an increase in facilities costs associated with the p i vertical expansion in houston  texas  and anders expansion in the uk contract start up expenses associated with two major account wins  one within the it services vertical and one within the government services vertical

operating profit was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 

table of contents operating profit as a percentage of revenues was in as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is a result of the net effect of those items discussed above 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate relates primarily to favorable resolution of prior year s tax exposures in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the company s income taxes 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from million in to million in the company s cash needs increased during the year above the levels in recent years due primarily to higher working capital requirements driven by the higher revenue run rate  new business ramp ups  and start up costs for the major account wins in the it services and government services verticals 
in addition  the company s capital spending increased to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in capital spending was due primarily to the continued development of a new recruiting software application for bs  expansion of the houston engineering center facility in bs p i vertical  and implementation of new billing and payroll systems for todays and mri 
to meet these cash requirements  the company utilized its unsecured line of credit during  however  borrowings under the credit facility were repaid by year end 
segment discussion business solutions bs business strategy bs business model is a key factor to its continued growth and profitability 
bs pursues the development of long term affiliations and alliances with its customers as a cost effective  single source provider of professional staffing and project outsourcing services 
by working as a central supplier and partner with its customers on their capital programs  bs is able to develop an understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical needs of their projects 
this approach creates the opportunity for bs to provide a greater and more integrated range of services for its customers to facilitate efficient project management  program integration and transition  and execution 
the success of bs business strategy is dependent on maintaining and renewing its existing customers or contracts  continued capital spending by its major engineering customers  the ability to win new contract awards and accounts and the availability and cost of labor 
in addition  bs continues to strategically engage in offshore outsourcing arrangements 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses bs performance through various means  with the primary financial and operational measures including revenue growth  new contract wins  new accounts and gross margin 
revenue growth reflects performance on both new and existing contracts 
incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs  particularly operating and administrative expenses  thus potentially improving profit margins 
new contract and account wins are the primary drivers of future revenue and provide an assessment of bs ability to compete 
the total level of new contract wins fluctuates from year to year depending on the timing of new contracts as well as numerous external factors 
bs employs strict financial and operational reviews in the contracting process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns 
gross margins reflect bs performance and ability to achieve desired pricing and control labor costs 
while gross margin can shift as a result of the mix of business  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved profitability 
results of operations the following table presents year over year changes in revenue from each of bs verticals for and change in millions revenues cdi process and industrial cdi information technology services cdi aerospace cdi government services cdi life sciences the p i vertical focuses on cost competitive  small to medium sized engineering projects within the process sector  which includes the oil refining and chemical industries  as well as the industrial sector  which includes power generation  telecommunications and heavy manufacturing 
typically  these customers are large  industrial  multi national companies that use multiple vendors 
contracts are awarded based on the ability to meet the specific requirements of each individual project 
revenues within the p i vertical increased million  or  in as compared to this increase in revenues was largely attributable to strong capital spending by customers within the process sector  and to a lesser extent  within the industrial sector  resulting in both new account wins and a ramp up of existing accounts 
as a result  bs has increased the size and staffing of its houston engineering center facility to support this growth and more efficiently meet the needs of its customers 
in  revenues within the it services vertical decreased million  or  as compared to this decrease is attributable to the highly competitive it staffing industry which is subject to strong pricing pressures from customers and competitors 
new contracts are awarded through a formalized competitive bid process 
although the it services vertical was awarded a major preferred supplier contract in july  it did 
table of contents not produce significant revenue during the year 
in addition  there was a decline in volume in some of it s managed staffing contracts due to product line shutdowns  cutbacks  or offshore outsourcing 
in response to this trend  management has redirected sales and recruiting efforts to grow in targeted higher margin accounts and identified strong geographic markets 
the aerospace vertical provides staffing and outsourcing services to the commercial and military aerospace industries  which are dominated by several major national and international conglomerates 
aerospace s three largest customers represented approximately and of aerospace s revenues in and  respectively 
revenues within the aerospace vertical declined million  or  in as compared to the decrease in revenue is due primarily to the completion of several projects during the year and a decline in technical staffing revenue 
the government services vertical focuses on providing its services primarily to us government agencies and prime contractors in the shipbuilding  military aviation  and marine design industries 
in  revenues were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was driven primarily by the delayed us federal government funding of a major us navy shipbuilding and ship design contract 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by several managed staffing contracts awarded to government services during the year 
these managed staffing contracts are expected to favorably impact government services revenue in revenues within the life sciences vertical of million decreased million  or  in as compared to this revenue decline was largely attributable to continued project delays and loss of business

bs gross profit of million in increased million  or  as compared to million in this increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher volume and rate increases in the p i vertical 
however  the overall gross profit margin fell slightly to from in due primarily to lower margin business in the information technology services vertical 
adjustments amounting to million in connection with accounting errors that occurred in previous fiscal years and were recorded in the fourth quarter of higher sui rates resulting in higher costs which were not passed on to customers 
the decrease in gross profit margin was partially offset by higher volume and margin in the p i vertical 
bs operating and administrative expenses of million increased million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was a result of higher staff salaries and incentive based compensation associated with the revenue growth discussed above 
contract start up expenses associated with two major account wins  one within the it services vertical and one within the government services vertical 
an increase in houston area facility  office and computer costs to accommodate additional staff 
this expansion was necessary to support the revenue growth in the p i vertical noted above 
the increase in operating and administrative expenses was partially offset by lower net expenses and legal fees associated with certain litigation  claims and disputes totaling million in and lower travel expenses in all verticals due to expense containment measures instituted in  with the exception of increases in the p i vertical due to the revenue growth noted above

the uk economy remains strong and demand in the infrastructure sector continues to grow with the expansion at heathrow airport  rebuilding of the country s rail system and other government related projects 
in addition  anders anticipates that the london olympics will provide opportunities for future revenue and operating profit growth 
key performance indicators anders relies on various operational and financial metrics to manage its business 
key metrics include direct margin by recruiter and branch office  payroll costs as a percentage of gross margins  and net profit as a percentage of revenue 
monitoring direct margin by recruiter and branch office enables the company to focus on increasing productivity  thereby increasing profit margins 
additionally  monitoring recruiter and branch performance allows the company to ensure all levels of services are met 
gross margins may not increase at the same percentage rate as revenue 
since payroll costs represent a significant component of direct costs  monitoring and controlling payroll costs relative to gross margins can improve gross profit

todays staffing todays business strategy todays focuses on providing the highest quality candidate to fit the specific needs of the customer 
this commitment to quality is reinforced by a process that includes behavioral interviews  customized evaluations  comprehensive reference checks  and periodic employee assessments  and is supported by a 
table of contents satisfaction guarantee policy 
due to the quality control checks performed by todays prior to placing the employee  the financial impact of this guarantee has been immaterial 
todays operations are organized into two service divisions temporary and managed staffing solutions  which include both large  multi location national accounts and higher margin retail accounts ie  local and small business accounts  and permanent placement services 
todays strategic growth objectives for market expansion include retain and expand services to existing customers 
target markets with strong growth characteristics in high margin services 
further develop legal and financial staffing lines 
cross sell to customers of other company segments 
revenues are favorably impacted by sustained economic recovery  strong gdp growth  and low us unemployment rates 
key performance indicators todays monitors its performance through various operational and financial measures  including weekly billable hours  revenue growth  permanent placement revenue  direct margin per hour and gross margin 
weekly billable hours and revenue growth are impacted by changes in market share  the ability to capitalize on opportunities created by economic expansion  and performance on existing accounts 
incremental increases in weekly billable hours and revenue will not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs  particularly operating and administrative expenses  thus potentially improving profit margins 
weekly billable hours increased approximately in over levels 
this increase is reflected in the growth in staffing services revenue indicated below 
permanent placement revenue is driven by the increase or decrease in the number of placements 
in some cases  an employee is initially assigned to a customer on a temporary basis  but is later hired by that customer 
todays receives staffing services revenue as well as a fee for these placements 
permanent placement revenue  which represents approximately of todays total revenue  has an impact on gross margin 
since there are low direct costs associated with permanent placement revenue  increases or decreases in permanent placement revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross margin rates 
direct margin per hour and gross margin reflect todays performance 
while gross margin can shift as a result of the mix of business  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved profitability

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the disclosure of contingencies 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates that affect the consolidated financial statements as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant are discussed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
estimates used in determining accounts receivable allowances are based on specific customer account reviews  historical experience of credit losses and application of percentages to certain aged receivable categories 
the company also applies judgment including assessments about changes in economic conditions  concentration of receivables among customers and industries  recent write off trends  rates of bankruptcy  and credit quality of specific customers 
unanticipated changes in the financial condition of customers  the resolution of various disputes  or significant changes in the economy could impact the reserves required 
at december    and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million  and million  respectively 
income taxes the company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws  published tax guidance  as well as estimates of future earnings 
these judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance 
as of december   the company has total net deferred tax assets of million 
this includes million which relates primarily to state net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards  and other miscellaneous credits 
the deferred tax assets were evaluated under the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and a determination on the basis of objective factors was made that the net assets will be realized through future years taxable income 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments  additional valuation allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arising from acquisitions is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
generally  the company performs its impairment assessment during its third fiscal quarter 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the company  the period over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
changes in future market conditions  the company s business strategy  or other factors could impact upon the future values of the company s reporting units  which could result in future impairment charges 
at december   total goodwill amounted to million 

table of contents workers compensation the company has a combination of insurance contracts and self insurance under which the company generally bears the first  of risk per single accident 
the company establishes accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process includes establishing loss development factors based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
in preparing the estimates  the company also considers the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the established accrual 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  periodically throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed based on such evaluation 
the accrual for workers compensation was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
contingencies the company is primarily in the business of employing people and providing technical and engineering services to businesses on a temporary or outsourced basis 
as a result  cdi is party to litigation in the ordinary course of its business 
the outcome of litigation brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency  such as a legal proceeding or claim  should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact the company s financial position or consolidated results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
the approach to quantifying stock based compensation expense in sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
however  the revised statement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of earnings based on their fair values as they are earned by the employees under the vesting terms 
pro forma disclosure of stock option expense  as is the company s practice under sfas  will not be permitted after the company plans to follow the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas no 
r 
the company will adopt sfas no 
r as required on january  as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based compensation to employees under the apb opinion no 
intrinsic value method and generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the sfas no 
r fair value method will impact the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r will depend on levels of share based compensation  particularly stock options and stock appreciation rights  granted in the future and the fair value assigned thereto 
the future impact of sfas no 
r is likely to approximate the pro forma compensation expense reported under sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses the actual forfeitures method whereby pro forma compensation expense is reduced only when options are forfeited 
under sfas no 
r  the estimated forfeiture method is required such that expected future forfeitures will be reflected as a reduction of stock based compensation expense 
however  under sfas no 
r  reduction of compensation expense is not permitted if a vested share based payment is later forfeited  as would occur when an out of the money stock option is surrendered by a resigning employee 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  but the company does not expect this to have a significant impact on its cash flow reporting 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin no 
requires recognition of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  assuming that the settlement date is estimable 
the cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tangible long lived asset and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 
fin no 
was effective no 
table of contents later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted fin no 
on december  for the company  this interpretation only applied to real estate restoration activities at certain anders segment properties which are rented under operating lease agreements 
the impact of adopting this interpretation was the recognition of additional leasehold improvement assets amounting to million  an asset retirement obligation of million and a charge of million million  net of tax  which was included in cumulative effect of accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  adoption of this standard would not have had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition for each of the earlier periods presented 
in may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb opinion no 
required the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to be included in net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires a change in accounting principle to be retrospectively applied to prior period financial statements 
the company will assess the impact of sfas no 
when and if a change in accounting principle occurs after its effective date of january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relates to its operations in foreign countries conducted through subsidiaries operating primarily in the united kingdom and canada 
exchange rate fluctuations impact the u 
s 
dollar value of reported earnings derived from these foreign operations as well as the company s investment in the net assets related to these operations 
from time to time  the company engages in hedging activities with respect to its foreign operations 
during  the company entered into a foreign exchange put option contract to hedge a portion of its european operations forecasted net earnings 
the company purchased british pound sterling put options aggregating million with contractual exchange rates of at a cost of  the options expired at various periods during with the put option expiring on december  historically  the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to the company s net earnings 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is not significant 
during  the company s maximum short term borrowings were million 
in  the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings was 
as of december   the company had no bank borrowings outstanding 
the company s investments in money market instruments are primarily at variable rates
