item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition  operating results  and business plans and objectives 
these statements reflect our management s estimates based on our current goals  in light of management s expectations about future developments 
statements about expectations and future performance are forward looking statements which describe our goals  objectives and anticipated performance 
these statements are inherently uncertain  and some or all of these statements may not come to pass 
accordingly  you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take 
our future actions  as well as our actual performance  will vary from our current expectations  and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse 
some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled risks and uncertainties below 
other issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business  operating results and financial condition include environmental and land use regulations that limit our ability to harvest timber and develop property and economic conditions that affect consumer demand for our products and the prices we receive for them  and other risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the forward looking statements in this report reflect our estimates as of the date of the report  and we cannot undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the partnership s audited consolidated financial statements included with this report 
executive overview pope resources  a delaware limited partnership we or the partnership  was organized in october as a result of a spin off by pope talbot  inc p t 
pope resources is engaged in three primary businesses 
the first  and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations is the fee timber segment 
operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to domestic and export manufacturers 
the second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate 
real estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits  entitlements  and  in some cases  installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that land s value by the selling of larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain  either to home buyers or to operators and lessors or commercial property 
since these land projects span multiple years  the real estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed until that project is sold resulting in operating income 
our third business is providing timberland related services to third parties 
these services may take the form of large scale timberland management  forestry consulting  or acquisition or disposition services 
as of december   we owned nearly  acres of timberland in western washington state plus nearly  acres of real estate held for sale or development 
our third party services have historically been conducted in washington  oregon  and california 
macroeconomic factors that have a significant bearing on our business include housing starts in the us and to a lesser degree in japan  interest rates  and currency exchange rates particularly those between the us and canada  japan  and europe 
the first two of these factors reflect or influence the health of the us housing market 
currency exchange rates influence the competitiveness of our primary product compared to logs that might be imported from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere 
our export logs are sold to domestic intermediaries who then export the logs 
a favorable us yen exchange rate can help these intermediaries compete in the japanese market with logs that originate from canada  europe  or the southern hemisphere thus increasing the price that we are able to realize from the sale of this export quality log volume 
as an owner and manager of timberland  we focus keenly on three product markets lumber  logs  and timberland 
each of these markets has unique and distinct market factors so that they do not move up or down in lockstep with each other 
generally  the lumber market is the most volatile as it responds quickly even daily to changes in housing driven demand and to changes in lumber inventories 
log markets will in turn be affected by what is happening in the lumber spot markets  but pricing shifts typically adjust monthly rather than daily 
log price volatility is also moderated because logs are used to produce products besides just lumber especially pulp 
the market for timberland tends to be less volatile with pricing that lags both lumber and log markets 
this is a function of the longer time horizons utilized by timberland investors where the short swing fluctuations of log or lumber prices become stabilized in acquisition modeling 
we watch the lumber market because activity there can presage log price changes 
we are in the log market constantly as we negotiate delivery prices to our customers 
the timberland market is important as we are constantly evaluating our own portfolio and its underlying value as well as the opportunities to adjust that portfolio through either the acquisition or disposition of such land 
management s major opportunity and challenge is to grow our revenue base profitably 
we have added almost  acres to our timberland and real estate portfolios over the last five years 
our real estate challenges center around how and when to harvest a parcel of land and capture the optimum value increment by selling the property 
regarding our third party timberland services  we entered into a management contract with cascade timberlands llc cascade in january to manage that company s  acres of timberland in washington and oregon 
additionally  now that we have obtained commitments for the million orm timber fund i  lp we are seeking to add to our timberland ownership  albeit indirectly  through our co investment in the fund 
successful acquisitions by the fund will also result in additional management fees for the timberland management consulting segment 
our consolidated revenue in   and  on a percentage basis by segment  are as follows segment fee timber timberland management consulting real estate further segment financial information is presented in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report 
outlook management plans to decrease harvest volume from mmbf in to mmbf in the harvest level anticipates another mmbf of harvest from our acquisitions with the balance in line with our estimated sustainable harvest level of mmbf 
we also expect that log prices will soften modestly in from to reflect some cooling in us housing markets 
in contrast with the resultant decline in fee timber revenue due to softer log prices and lower harvests anticipated in  our real estate segment expects to close several land sales in that will boost results compared to prior periods 
in particular  we expect to close property sales in both our gig harbor and bremerton development projects in successful closings for these planned sales are contingent upon obtaining entitlements and completing infrastructure improvements 
management fees generated by the timberland management consulting segment are expected to decline as our primary timberland management client disposes of its timberland 
we do anticipate  however  that disposition fees earned by this segment will largely offset the decline in management fees in results of operations the following table reconciles net income for the years ended december  to and to in addition to the table s numeric analysis  the explanatory text that follows describes many of these changes by business segment

total change in earnings a price variance allocated based on changes in price using the current period volume

fee timber revenue and operating income fee timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from the partnership s  acres of fee timberland located in western washington and  to a lesser extent from the lease of cellular communication towers and the sale of gravel 
revenue from the sale of timberland tracts will also appear periodically in results for this segment 
our fee timber revenue is driven primarily by the volume of timber harvested  which we ordinarily express in terms of millions of board feet  or mmbf  and by the average prices realized on log sales  which we express in dollars per thousand board feet  or mbf 
revenue and operating income for the fee timber segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows all amounts in millions year ended timber revenue mineral  cell tower  and other revenue total segment revenue operating income december  december  december  fiscal year compared to harvest volume was up during from this increase was due to a higher planned harvest in following two timberland acquisitions in one acquired in q and the other in q where each had a sizeable component of merchantable timber that allowed us to convert that volume to cash over a short term period so as to recoup as much of the acquisition cost as practicable 
in addition  average log prices were up per mbf  representing a increase over s log prices 
taken together  these higher volumes and stronger prices resulted in the million  or  increase in revenue for versus operating income in for the fee timber segment increased million  or from notably  the increase in harvest volume did not result in a proportionate increase in operating income due primarily to a per mbf  or million  increase in depletion expense when comparing and the increase in depletion expense results from the use of a separate depletion pool for the timberland acquired in the fourth quarter of the harvest volume from this acquisition has a separate depletion pool because the property has characteristics that are different from the pooled property  specifically the timber on this property at the time of acquisition was almost completely merchantable 
as a result of accounting for harvests from this particular acreage using the separate depletion pool and its correspondingly high per mbf depletion charge  the incremental harvest from this acquisition generated significant cash flow but had much less impact on operating income 
the cash generated through and into related to the timber harvested from the fourth quarter acquisition will serve to offset a large portion of its purchase price 
fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in harvest volume increased to mmbf from mmbf for this boost in harvest volume combined with a per mbf increase in average price realized resulted in the increase in revenue 
operating income increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in operating income is due to the increase in revenue  partially offset by the increase in cost of sales and operating expenses 
log volume log volume sold for each year in the three year period ended december   is as follows volume in mmbf total total total sawlogs douglas fir whitewood cedar hardwoods pulp all species total log volume increased in from this increase is due to a timberland acquisition in late that enabled us to increase our annual harvest in the portion of total harvest attributable to cedar and hardwood sawlogs increased in due to the fourth quarter timberland acquisition 
this property contained a relatively high volume of cedar and red alder sawlogs 
pulp log volume as a percentage of total volume decreased to from as a result of the harvest of fewer low quality timber stands in compared to log volume in was higher than due to a january timberland acquisition that allowed us to increase our annual harvest 
the relatively high portion of harvest attributable to pulp logs is due to several clean up harvest units that were completed in in order to replant the acres and improve the quality of the timber growing on those units 
harvest volume in is expected to decline to mmbf  which is more in line with our estimated sustainable harvest level of mmbf 
log prices the following discussion of log prices and volumes is presented in a different format than we have used in the past 
a change has been made to present this information in a way that better reflects the drivers of log prices in our current operating environment 
we are placing less emphasis on the export market in the discussion below  in part because management believes the domestic market is currently the primary driver of log demand 
we continue to sell logs to log brokers that will then export those logs to japan  korea  and china  but this portion of the market has declined over the last ten years 
we have categorized our sawlog volume by species  which we believe is a significant driver of price realized as indicated by the table below 
the average log price realized by species for each year in the three year period ended december   is as follows price mbf change change sawlogs douglas fir whitewood cedar hardwoods pulp all species douglas fir douglas fir is noted for its structural characteristics that make it generally preferable to other softwoods and hardwoods for the production of construction grade lumber and plywood 
the price realized on douglas fir logs has increased in from the increase in price realized in is attributed to a combination of strong housing starts in the us and additional lumber mills opening in the puget sound area of washington 
from to the price realized on douglas fir sawlogs increased by 
this increase was due to a combination of strong housing starts in the us and a decline in log volume imported from british columbia in the decline in british columbia import volume was due to hot dry weather and a labor strike in that canadian province  which resulted in a decline in log volume available for export into the us it is worth noting that log imports from canada increased again in but demand for logs was strong enough that this supply increase did not cause a decline in price 
whitewood whitewood is a term used to describe several softwood species  but for us primarily refers to western hemlock 
though generally considered to be of a lower quality than douglas fir  these logs are also used for manufacturing construction grade lumber and plywood 
the average price realized on whitewood increased in from  and in from whitewood prices have increased more dramatically than douglas fir as the market has become more accepting of utilizing whitewood as a less expensive substitute for douglas fir 
the new lumber mills referenced above in the discussion of douglas fir prices are also a factor in whitewood pricing as these mills are buying both log species 
cedar cedar prices have declined from to and again from to this decline is attributed to a decrease in mills located in the puget sound area of washington that manufacture cedar products 
cedar has become less available in the pacific northwest  and as a result cedar mills have been closing which reduces demand and price for cedar logs 
hardwood hardwood can refer to many different species  but on our tree farms primarily represents red alder 
the price realized from the sale of red alder sawlogs has increased steadily over the last couple years as new red alder mills have opened to take advantage of the relatively high availability of low cost red alder logs in the pacific northwest 
these mills manufacture lumber for use in furniture construction 
pulp pulp is a lower quality log of any species that is manufactured into wood chips 
these chips are used to manufacture many products including oriented strand board  paper  and cardboard 
the price realized from the sale of pulp logs is primarily driven by local pulp log inventories 
the decline in the realized price for pulp logs in compared to is due to an increase in pulp log supplies which are generally a byproduct resulting from logging activities 
the increase in log prices generally from to resulted in an increase in logging activities that has in turn resulted in an increase in pulp logs available for sale to local pulp mills 
customers destination volume price volume price volume price lumber mills export brokers pulp total volume in mmbf lumber mills represented of our harvest volume sold in and price realizations were higher than the price realized in the increase in price realized is due to the strong housing market experienced in export brokers represent those log buyers that purchase our logs and then resell them primarily to the export market 
usually these brokers buy high quality douglas fir logs  but in they were also buying some western hemlock logs for export to korea 
as a result of this sort mix  the average price realized from sales to these brokers declined slightly in despite a relatively strong export market for logs 
volume sold to pulp log customers represented of total volume sold  a decline from both and in  of total log volume was sold to export brokers 
this relatively high proportion of log volume sold to export brokers reflected the high quality of a particular timber stand harvested in harvest volumes and seasonality the partnership s nearly  acres of timberland consist of both the  acre hood canal tree farm and the  acre columbia tree farm 
the hood canal tree farm is located in the hood canal region of washington state 
most of this tree farm acreage is at a relatively low elevation where harvest activities are possible year round 
as a result of this competitive advantage  we are often able to harvest and sell a greater portion of our annual harvest in the first half of the year when the log supply in the marketplace tends to be lower 
the percentage of annual harvest volume harvested by quarter for each year in the three year period ended december  is as follows year ended q q q q december  december  december  cost of sales cost of sales for the fee timber segment consists of harvest costs and depletion expense 
harvest costs represent the direct cost incurred to convert trees into logs and deliver those logs to their point of sale and associated state excise taxes owed on the harvest of logs 
depletion expense represents the cost of acquiring or growing the timber harvested 
this cost is calculated using a depletion rate that is derived as follows depletion rate accumulated cost of timber and capitalized road expenditures estimated volume of year old merchantable timber available for harvest the depletion rate is then applied to volume harvested to calculate depletion expense 
fee timber cost of sales  expressed on a per mbf basis for each year in the three year period ended december   is as follows year ended depletion harvest  haul and other total cost of sales december  december  december  as described above  a depletion rate is calculated based upon the historical cost of the timber and related capitalized road expenditures 
that calculated rate is then applied to all volume harvested 
we are using two separate depletion rates in  one for volume harvested from those timberlands we acquired in the fourth quarter of the quilcene timberlands  and one for volume harvested from all other owned timberlands 
since the quilcene timberlands were recently acquired  the cost of the timber is high relative to the cost basis of our existing timber 
the increase in s overall depletion rate and in depletion expense over that experienced in stemmed from harvest activity on the quilcene timberlands for which we created a separate depletion pool 
we created this separate depletion pool because the property had different characteristics than our other pooled property  specifically the timber on this property was almost completely merchantable 
we harvested a total of approximately mmbf in  with mmbf attributable to this separate depletion pool created for the quilcene timberlands 
the depletion expense resulting from quilcene timberlands log harvests approximated the net stumpage value delivered log price less harvesting and transportation cost realized on the sale of this particular timber 
as such  the incremental harvest from this acquired property resulted in a negligible net income impact even as it generated significant operating cash flow and ebitdda 
depletion expense is generated from the harvest and sale of timber and some minor amount of depletion results from real estate sales when land is sold with standing timber 
depletion expense resulting from timber harvest for each year in the three year period ended december  was made up of the following year ended december  pooled separate total volume harvested mbf rate mbf depletion expense year ended december  pooled separate total volume harvested mbf rate mbf depletion expense year ended december  pooled separate total volume harvested mbf rate mbf depletion expense harvest costs vary based upon the physical site characteristics of acreage harvested 
harvest units that are difficult to access  or that are located on steep hillsides requiring cable harvest systems are more expensive to harvest 
haul costs vary based upon the distance between the harvest site and the customer s location 
per mbf costs to harvest and haul timber have increased in relative to due to a combination of these factors increased fuel costs  longer than average hauls for log transport to customer locations  and the harvest schedule includes a higher than usual proportion of harvest units characterized by steep slopes that are more expensive to harvest 
per mbf costs to harvest and haul timber did not change significantly between and despite a small increase in due to the fuel cost surcharges 
this cost component increase is not transparently reflected in s average harvest  haul and other costs due to the mitigating factor that the mix of stands harvested were generally easier to access and  thus  less expensive to harvest than the units 
fee timber cost of sales for each year in the three year period ended december  is as follows all amounts in millions year ended depletion harvest  haul and other total cost of sales december  december  december  fee timber cost of sales increased million in from and million in from the increase in and is due to combination of increased harvest volume and an increase in depletion rate due to a separate depletion pool used for timber harvested from acquisitions 
the impact of this additional depletion was particularly pronounced in due to the aforementioned harvest from the quilcene timberlands 
operating expenses fee timber operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating costs increased in relative to due primarily to an increase in road maintenance expenditures 
operating costs increased in relative to due to an increase in road maintenance and silviculture costs 
the increase in road costs in result primarily from the increase in harvest volume  but also reflect increased costs resulting from the road maintenance and abandonment plan rules in washington state 
washington state has enacted new water quality rules  which have resulted in changes to the rules surrounding road maintenance and construction 
as a result  culverts that do not comply with the new rules need to be replaced  which has caused an increase in road maintenance costs over the last couple years and is expected to continue into  at which point these expenditures should level out to reflect that necessary remediation has been completed 
silviculture costs represent the cost of projects that are undertaken for the purpose of increasing the quantity or quality of our timber inventory 
examples include eradication of competing vegetation and work performed to improve the seed stock available for us to grow seedlings for future reforestation 
timberland management consulting revenue and operating income the timberland management consulting segment earns revenue by providing timberland management and forestry consulting services to timberland owners and managers 
an additional aspect of that segment s activities is the development of timberland property portfolios on behalf of third party clients 
management is currently pursuing timberland acquisitions for orm timber fund i  lp 
on january  the timberland management consulting segment began managing  acres of timberland for cascade timberlands llc 
this new project included management  consulting  and disposition services during revenue and operating income for the timberland management consulting segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows all amounts in millions year ended revenue operating income loss december  december  december  fiscal year compared to revenue and operating income for were million and million higher  respectively  than those amounts for the increase in revenue and operating income is primarily due to timberland management  property disposition  and consulting services provided to cascade for its timberland located in washington and oregon 
olympic resource management llc ormllc  a subsidiary of the partnership  began providing timberland management and other timberland consulting services to this client in january revenue generated in consisted of fees earned while providing advisory services to the parties that eventually became the owners of cascade and fees generated through providing miscellaneous consulting and management services to a variety of timberland owners 
on august  the partnership announced that management had obtained capital commitments of million  of which pope resources has committed million  for the launch of a private equity timber fund  orm timber fund i  lp 
ormllc is the general partner for the fund and pope resources is a limited partner 
we are now actively searching for timber properties for the fund to acquire 
the timberland management consulting segment is expected to earn fees from managing the fund once properties have been acquired with the committed capital 
fiscal year compared to revenue decreased  or  to million in from million in operating income declined  to a loss of  in from income of  in the decrease in revenue and operating income was primarily a result of completing a timberland management and disposition project in december operations in were focused on signing up new timberland management clients 
operating expenses timberland management consulting operating expenses for were million higher than in the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the opening of two new field office locations in sedro woolley  washington and bend  oregon and the additional staffing necessary to provide services under the timberland management agreement with cascade 
organization and start up expenses for the aforementioned private equity timber fund were  during these expenses are included in timberland management consulting operating expenses 
timberland management consulting operating expenses for and were million  and million  respectively 
notwithstanding that we entered without a major client for this segment  we decided to maintain our investment in people and operating infrastructure given prospects for new business 
accordingly  operating expenses remained basically flat between and investor portfolio management business ipmb ipmb operations include timberland management and portfolio development 
an example of portfolio development is orm timber fund i  lp 
when the fund acquires timberland properties  both timberland management and asset management fees will be earned from administering the fund 
these activities are  as well as the development and marketing costs associated with the fund  part of the ipmb 
limitation on expenditures the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement authorizing the ipmb strategy limits our cumulative net expenditures incurred on connection with the ipmb to  including debt guarantees 
as of december  cumulative expenditures incurred in pursuit of ipmb opportunities  including guarantees  were less than cumulative revenue generated 
therefore  cumulative net expenditures as of december  against the  limit are zero 
allocation of income in addition  the amendment to pope resources limited partnership agreement further specifies that income from the ipmb will be split using a sliding scale allocation method beginning at to the partnership s wholly owned subsidiary  orm  inc  and to pope mgp  inc  the managing general partner of the partnership 
the sliding scale allocation method will evenly divide ipmb income between orm  inc and pope mgp  inc once such income reaches  in any given fiscal year 
real estate revenue and operating income the partnership s real estate segment consists primarily of revenue from the sale of land together with residential and commercial property rents 
the partnership s real estate holdings are located in pierce  kitsap  and jefferson counties in washington state 
results from real estate operations are expected to vary significantly from year to year as we make multi year investments in entitlements and infrastructure prior to selling entitled or developed land 
revenue and operating income for the real estate segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows all amounts in millions year ended revenue operating income loss december  december  december  includes  of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble includes  of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble revenue in the real estate segment is generated through the sale of raw land  rural residential lots  and the rental of homes and commercial properties at the port gamble townsite 
raw land sales generally consist of larger acreage sales rather than single lot sales and are normally completed with very little capital investment prior to sale 
rural lifestyles lot sales generally require some capital improvements such as zoning  road building  or utility access improvements prior to completing the sale 
real estate segment revenue for each of the years ended december   and consist of the following description revenue gross margin acres sold revenue acre gross margin acre raw land rural lifestyles rentals na na na na other na na na total raw land rentals na na na na other na na na total raw land rentals na na na na other na na na total at our development property in gig harbor  washington  costco wholesale corporation  northwest capital investors nci  and a subsidiary of the partnership  olympic property group opg submitted detailed applications with the city of gig harbor for a acre retail shopping center in opg s harbor hill project 
the applications submitted to the city of gig harbor are for site plan review and a binding site plan for a proposed costco store and over five acres of additional multi tenant retail space 
opg is currently constructing a road  water tank and other infrastructure improvements in anticipation of our first closing on this property during the first half of in addition to the sale transactions discussed above we expect to close during on the sale of acres to the ymca 
this acre sale is from the business park portion of the gig harbor property  which represents acres of the total project 
we are currently projecting to close on approximately acres of the gig harbor project during the partnership s rural lifestyles lot program produces lots from to acres in size  based on underlying zoning densities 
this type of program entails an entitlement effort typically consisting of simple lot segregations and boundary line adjustments 
development activities include minor road building  surveying  and the extension of utilities 
we anticipate selling approximately acres annually in the rural lifestyles lot program 
we exceeded this target in due to a very strong market interest in rural lots 
a acre planned development in the city of bremerton  washington bremerton west hills includes acres of industrial and acres of residential uses 
we actively marketed the residential portion of this property in and this resulted in a number of bids 
we are currently under contract to sell this property for million and anticipate a closing by the end of prior to this closing we are building a road that we are obligated to build under the purchase and sale agreement for the residential portion of the property 
this road and related infrastructure will cost million to construct and is expected not only to add value to the residential portion we are selling in  but to the industrial portion of the property as well that we plan to begin marketing for sale during fiscal year compared to revenue increased  or  to million in from million in while operating income for this segment decreased to million in from million in the increase in revenue is principally due to an increase in rural lifestyles acreage sold in relative to land sale revenue in consists of separate transactions totaling acres with million representing acres coming from rural lifestyles lot sales 
one of the primary drivers in the price per acre realized from these sales is whether the property is sold with legal access 
for example  in rural lifestyles acreage sales included acres sold without first obtaining legal access 
these sales grossed an average of  per acre  while the remaining acres that were sold with legal access grossed an average of  per acre 
the decline in operating income for from is due to the mix of properties sold in versus raw land revenue in included a million sale to kitsap county of acres that the county plans to develop into a park 
this property required very little entitlement or other improvements prior to the sale  which generated a relatively high gross margin from the sale 
raw land revenue realized in represented a sale of relatively less attractive development property to the washington state department of fish and wildlife for  or  per acre 
additionally  operating expenses for the real estate segment have increased as several projects that we have been working on entitling for a number of years have progressed to the point of development or close to that stage 
these projects include the gig harbor project where we expect to begin generating revenue in  the bremerton property where the acre residential portion is currently under contract and expected to sell in  the kingston arborwood project for which we plan to bring forward plans during the coming year  and finally the rural lifestyles land program 
fiscal year compared to revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in operating income for this segment also improved from a loss of  in to operating income of million in the increase in both revenue and operating income was due to an increase in acres sold and amounts realized per acre for land sales in relative to in  we generated land sale revenue of million that translated to operating income from land sales of million 
this compared favorably with land sale revenue of  and operating income from land sales of  the majority of land sale revenue in came from two transactions 
the first transaction was a million sale to kitsap county of acres that the county plans to develop into a park 
this sale has the added benefit of enhancing the value of the partnership s other development properties neighboring the planned park 
the second transaction was for million and closed in december this transaction represented acres that had a preliminary plat for lots filed with the county  thus increasing the value of the property to developers 
cost of sales real estate cost of sales for each of the three years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
cost of sales during resulted from the aforementioned raw land and rural lifestyles lot sales 
the increase in cost of sales in and is due to the increase in acres sold 
cost of sales in was further increased by the relatively higher level of entitlement and other improvements made to property sold in when compared to land sold in operating expenses real estate operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
real estate operating expenses in include an environmental remediation charge of  while operating expenses for include environmental remediation charges of  operating expenses less environmental remediation charges  the latter discussed in more detail below  increased  in compared to higher operating expenses in the real estate segment are due to an increase in personnel and project costs at the gig harbor  bremerton  and arborwood projects as well as increased market activity for developable land 
this trend is expected to continue in the increase in operating costs in relative to is due to the environmental remediation charge of  combined with a small increase in repairs and maintenance costs at the port gamble townsite 
environmental remediation the partnership has accrued liabilities for environmental cleanup of  and  as of december  and  respectively  for estimated environmental remediation charges in and around the townsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned by pope talbot  inc p t for decades until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the townsite through and lease the millsite at port gamble until january when a settlement agreement was signed between the partnership and p t 
this settlement agreement set forth how the two companies would apportion the costs and responsibility for environmental remediation in port gamble 
the millsite is referred to as such because a lumber mill operated on that portion of the property for over one hundred years through before it was dismantled by the end of the environmental liability at december  includes  that the partnership expects to expend in the next months and  thereafter 
current activities at the site include monitoring to determine if prior clean up activities were effective 
activity in the environmental remediation liability is detailed as follows year ended december  balances at the beginning of the year additions to accrual expenditures for remediation balances at the end of the year as of december  the majority of the clean up work apportioned to the partnership under the aforementioned settlement agreement was complete 
most of the ongoing expenditures now represent the cost of groundwater monitoring at those specific sites where contaminants were excavated and removed 
test results from this monitoring program since completion of the clean up efforts have been mixed 
the consultants engaged by management to assist with the clean up project have informed us that if the test results do not improve  the cost of the clean up project could increase from our current estimated cost range of  to  general and administrative g a fiscal year compared to g a costs increased  or  to million from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses experienced in is due to an increase in compensation cost following strong financial performance in and  as well as costs associated with new audit requirements under the sarbanes oxley act 
g a costs represented of revenue in as compared to of revenue in fiscal year compared to g a costs increased  or  to million from million in the modest increase in g a costs is due to an increase in the accrual for supplemental employee retirement plan serp liabilities of  combined with an increase in compensation cost 
the beneficiary of the serp is a retired ceo 
g a costs represented of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of revenue for the comparable period in interest income and expense interest income for increased  to  compared to  in and  in the increase in interest income is due to higher cash and short term investments balances 
in january our then available cash balance was used to complete a timberland acquisition such that relatively little interest income accrued over the balance of our combined cash and short term investments balance in has grown from  at december  to million at december  we have invested cash in excess of immediate operating cash requirements in auction rate securities 
the maturities on these securities are long term while the interest rate earned resets every days 
interest expense for was million as compared to million in and the partnership s debt consists primarily of mortgage debt with a fixed interest rate and amortization schedule 
the terms of the timberland mortgages include a make whole premium paid to the lender for unscheduled principal payments 
the decrease in interest expense is the result of our annual million principal payment on these timberland mortgages made at the end of each year s first quarter 
income taxes pope resources is a limited partnership and is  therefore  not subject to income tax at the entity level 
instead  taxable income loss flows through and is reported to unitholders each year on a form k for inclusion in each unitholder s tax return 
pope resources does  however  have corporate subsidiaries that are subject to income tax and this is why a line item for such tax appears on the statements of operations for the partnership even though the partnership itself pays no income tax 
the corporate tax paying entities are utilized for the partnership s third party service fee businesses 
fiscal year compared to the partnership has recorded a provision for income taxes of million in  as compared to no tax expense for the corresponding period of the increase in tax expense is due to improved results in our timberland management consulting segment 
fiscal year compared to tax expense in was zero compared with  in  and these amounts reflected the divergent level of third party management business activity that ormllc engaged in each of these two years 
minority interest minority interest represents that share of income earned from the investor portfolio management business ipmb allocated to pope mgp  inc  the managing general partner of the partnership 
the amendment to the limited partnership agreement authorizing the partnership to pursue the ipmb further specifies that income from the ipmb will be split using a sliding scale allocation method beginning at to the partnership s wholly owned subsidiary  orm  inc  and to pope mgp  inc 
the sliding scale allocation method evenly divides ipmb income between orm  inc and pope mgp  inc once such income reaches  in a given fiscal year 
the share of ipmb allocated to pope mgp is further split between pope mgp and a management incentive plan referred to as the long term incentive plan 
this latter portion of pope mgp s share of the ipmb is  in and is included in timberland management consulting operating expenses 
current activities of the ipmb are contained in the timberland management consulting segment  which includes timberland consulting  management and disposition services  and expenses associated with the launch of a private equity timber fund 
fiscal year compared to the charge or expense that is the allocation of income to a minority interest increased from zero in to  in the increase in minority interest allocation is due to improved timberland management consulting results related to our work on behalf of cascade 
fiscal year compared to the charge or expense that is the allocation of income to a minority interest decreased  in to zero from  in the decline in minority interest is due to completion of our timberland disposition project in such that there was no income from activities in analysis of operating income the following table sets forth expenses as a percentage of revenue for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows revenue cost of sales operating expenses general and administrative expenses operating income cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing and producing tangible goods for sale 
in addition to depletion associated with timber production levels  cost of sales for the partnership will fluctuate due to the mix of revenue between the sale of tangible goods and revenue generated from providing services 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in depletion expense resulting from timber harvested from the partnership s separate depletion pool  which carries a higher depletion rate  offset somewhat by the increase in revenue generated by the timberland management consulting segment which does not have related cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage point in from this decrease is due to a large real estate sale in this land was formerly timberland and sold to kitsap county for use as a park 
this property had a very low cost basis thus serving to decrease cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses consist of salary and other costs directly attributable to revenue generating activity 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased percentage point in compared to this decrease is due to an increase in revenue in from all segments  but primarily from fee timber 
operating expenses in for the timberland management consulting segment increased over levels  but not enough to offset the revenue increase across all segments 
operating expense as a percentage of revenue declined percentage points in from operating expense as a percentage of revenue declined in despite completing a timberland management and disposition project in that left this segment without a major timberland management client for the first time since during the timberland management consulting segment continued to generate operating expenses while management pursued timberland management opportunities 
the increase  however  in fee timber and real estate revenue in over made up for the decline in revenue generated by the timberland management consulting segment over those two periods 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined percentage points in from due to the partnership s significant increase in revenue 
similarly  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points in from due to an increase in revenue

we generate operating cash flow through the sale of timber products  by providing timberland management  disposition  and consulting services  and by selling land for development 
significant recurring uses of cash include the following replanting and fertilizing trees  maintaining an adequate road system on our tree farms  investing in our development properties  funding annual debt payments on timber mortgages and local improvement district debt  funding quarterly cash distributions  and funding general and administrative expenses 
funds generated internally from operations and externally through financing are expected to provide the required resources for the partnership s future capital expenditures 
the partnership s debt to total capitalization ratio as measured by the book value of equity was at december  versus at december  management considers capital resources to be adequate for its current plans and does not have specific plans that would trigger a significant change in its debt to total capitalization ratio over the next months 
the partnership s debt consists primarily of a timberland mortgage with a fixed amortization schedule and loan terms that include a prepayment penalty 
in view of a cash and short term investment balance of approximately million at december   we elected not to renew a million line of credit  which expired on october  we will continue to monitor and forecast our expected cash requirements and re establish a line of credit if need for the additional liquidity should arise 
on august  we announced the closing of orm timber fund i  lp the fund with committed equity of million  of which pope resources has committed to invest million 
now that the fund is fully subscribed we are actively searching for suitable timber properties for the fund to acquire 
pope resources and the other limited partners in the fund are required to contribute committed capital as properties are purchased by the fund 
the partnership made two significant timberland acquisitions in by investing a total of million 
the first transaction was for  acres of timberland acquired from plum creek timber company  inc in january this property is being managed as part of the columbia tree farm inasmuch as these acquired acres are intermingled with that larger holding 
the second acquisition totaled  acres and closed during fourth quarter and was an opportunity to acquire timberland tracts adjacent to the partnership s existing hood canal tree farm 
we have termed these the quilcene timberlands and these properties were forested with ready to harvest  merchantable timber 
these acquisitions were funded primarily by cash reserves supplemented by draws on a bank line of credit 
the january acquisition had an impact on and harvest levels and cash flows 
the quilcene timberlands acquisition had a small impact on harvest levels and a major impact on harvest levels and cash flows 
harvest related cash flows resulting from these acquisitions have served to offset a large portion of each of the respective purchase prices  as indicated by the partnership s million cash and short term investment balance at december  the annual harvest target for is expected to be approximately mmbf as compared to mmbf in  as we complete harvest activities on timberland acquisitions 
for and beyond  absent new acquisitions or major dispositions  we expect an annual harvest level of approximately mmbf 
the planned decrease in harvest volume in relative to will result in a decline in fee timber revenue and cash flow 
we expect this decline to be offset on a consolidated basis as a result of planned real estate sales  particularly on the gig harbor and bremerton west hills projects 
during the year ended december   overall cash and cash equivalents increased million and we invested an additional million in short term investments versus a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million experienced during the prior year 
operating cash flows 
the table below provides the components of operating cash flows for each of the three years   and cash received from customers and paid to suppliers and employees results from the harvest and sale of forest products from our tree farms  timberland management  disposition  and consulting services provided to timberland owners  and finally  the sale and management of our development properties 
operating cash activities in thousands cash received from customers cash paid to suppliers and employees interest received interest paid income taxes paid total cash generated by operating activities increased to million in from million in the increase in cash generated by operating activities primarily resulted from the fee timber segment increase in timber volume harvested from mmbf in to mmbf in combined with a per mbf  a  increase in realized prices on log volume sold in compared to additionally  the timberland management consulting segment s million increase in ebitdda also contributed to the increase in operating cash flows in cash provided by the fee timber segment is expected to decline in due to a decrease in harvest level  but this is expected to be offset by an increase in real estate sales from the gig harbor project and a portion of the bremerton west hills property 
in  cash provided by operations increased million to million from million in the majority of this increase was produced by the fee timber segment due to an increase in timber volume harvested from mmbf in to mmbf in combined with a per mbf  or  increase in realized prices on log volume sold compared to the real estate segment also contributed to improved operating cash flow with an increase in cash provided by land sales of million 
cash used in investing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in investing activities for the three years   and recurring investing activities consist primarily of tree planting  road building and investment in our development properties to build infrastructure and acquire the entitlements necessary to make further development of the properties possible 
in we invested million to purchase timberlands with million of that total directed at two separate transactions that added nearly  acres to our timberland holdings 
investing activities in thousands land  buildings and equipment development properties timber and roads timberland real estate acquisitions purchase of short term investments proceeds from the sale of fixed assets cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased to million in from million in investing activities in consisted primarily of the purchase of million of auction rate securities and million of capital expenditures 
cash used to purchase short term investments represents the acquisition of auction rate securities 
these securities are being used as a vehicle for investing cash balances in excess of cash required for immediate operating needs 
we incurred capital expenditures in for the following items million of development costs at the gig harbor site  million of development costs on the partnership s other development properties  million of reforestation and road building costs on the owned timberlands   of miscellaneous items at the port gamble townsite and  of other miscellaneous expenditures 
the small decline in timber and road investing activities in versus is due to delaying fertilization until we plan to fertilize the acres that were planned for along with acres at an estimated cost of  by fertilizing more acres at one time we reduce the average cost per acre of the fertilization 
investing activities at the gig harbor and bremerton west hill projects are expected to increase significantly in as we continue construction of infrastructure at both properties 
cash used in investing activities increased million in over the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of  acres of timberland in the timberlands acquired in these transactions were forested with a large component of merchantable timber that enabled the partnership to increase its annual harvest in to mmbf from mmbf in these timberland acquisitions and related increased harvest activities also resulted in an increase in investments in timber and roads higher replanting and road building expenditures 
investments in development properties increased in to million from  in this increase correlates to our heightened intensity of activity on our acre property at gig harbor  washington given the expectation of land sales at this parcel beginning in the million spent on development property additions includes  for a land acquisition bordering the gig harbor site and  for a parcel bordering the port gamble townsite 
these acquisitions represent strategic opportunities to acquire acres bordering our existing properties where management expects such acquisitions will add value to the partnership s holdings 
cash used in financing activities 
the table below represents the components of cash used in financing activities for the three years   and our financing activities primarily reflect payments made on timber mortgages and other debt  unitholder distributions  and payments to the managing general partner  pope mgp  for its minority interest allocation of ipmb income 
these payments and outflows are partially offset by cash received from the exercise of unit options issued to employees and directors 
financing activities in thousands mortgage lid payments net paydown draw on line of credit cash distribution to unitholders cash received from unit option exercises minority interest distribution cash used by financing activities cash used in financing activities increased to million for from million for the corresponding period in cash used for financing activities in consisted of million of payments on long term debt   of paydowns of the line of credit  four unitholder distributions totaling million and  in minority interest distributions 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million received from the exercise of unit options 
the increase in cash used for financing activities in compared to is due primarily to an increase in our quarterly distributions 
in the third quarter of we increased our quarterly distribution rate from to per unit as a result of the increase in cash generated from operations in cash used in financing activities increased  in compared to this increase is due to an unscheduled paydown of our timber mortgage of  an increase in cash payments on local improvement district lid debt  and an increase in our quarterly distributions 
the unscheduled mortgage payment was made following the sale of acres to kitsap county 
these acres were included as collateral under the timber mortgage and the partial deed release required some incremental debt repayment 
in addition  the partnership began making payments on a  lid in that represents the partnership s share of new road costs at the gig harbor property that has had a positive impact on the value of that property 
in the third quarter of we increased our quarterly distribution rate from to per unit 
expected future changes to cash flows operating activities 
as discussed above  we plan to decrease the partnership s annual harvest volume from mmbf in to mmbf in this decrease is due to completion in of the bulk of incremental merchantable timber harvest from the two timberland acquisitions in the decreased harvest level will translate to lower cash flow from fee timber operations in however  planned land sales at our project in gig harbor and a portion of the bremerton property are expected to offset the decline in operating cash flow from the fee timber segment 
assuming we do not acquire any additional timberland in  the annual harvest in is expected to return to our sustainable harvest level of mmbf 
as we wind down our cascade management and disposition services role  fees generated from disposition services are expected to offset the decline in management fees in investing activities 
we have secured a committed equity balance of million for orm timber fund i lp  of which pope resources has committed to invest million 
now that the fund is closed we are actively searching for suitable timber properties for the fund to acquire 
pope resources and the other limited partners in the fund are required to contribute committed capital as properties are purchased by the fund 
in addition to the fund  capital infrastructure expenditures on our projects at gig harbor and bremerton are expected to total million and million  respectively  in the majority of gig harbor capital expenditures in are expected to reflect completion of a water tank and a new access road on the property 
capital expenditures on the bremerton property in will primarily relate to a storm water retention facility together with a road and sewer extension 
financing activities 
the capital required for gig harbor and bremerton is expected to be funded through our current cash and short term investment balances as well as operations 
we anticipate that cash generated from property sales will quickly result in positive cash flow that will offset this short term capital requirement 
management is currently projecting that cash on hand  short term investments  and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to bridge the front loading of this capital need 
this point of view reflects management s rationale for not renewing our bank line of credit  which has been utilized by the partnership at various times in its history 
our debt to total capitalization ratio as of december   as measured by the book and market value of our equity  was and  respectively 
should a financing need arise  management is comfortable that there is room to take on some debt with the ratios at these levels  since our loan covenant which limits debt to total capitalization to is measured against the lower of these two calculations 
the hood canal tree farm secures the partnership s current timberland mortgages while the columbia tree farm is not currently used as collateral for any debt obligations 
the partnership s strong financial position has to date enabled fairly easy access to credit at reasonable terms when needed 
seasonality fee timber 
the partnership owns nearly  acres of timberland in washington state 
our timber acreage is concentrated in two non contiguous tree farms the  acre hood canal tree farm located in kitsap  jefferson  and mason counties on the eastern side of washington s olympic peninsula  and the  acre columbia tree farm located in cowlitz  clark  lewis  skamania  and pierce counties on the western side of washington s cascade mountain range 
the hood canal tree farm is concentrated at low elevations  which permits us to harvest trees year round 
generally  we concentrate our harvests from this tree farm in the winter and spring when supply  and thus competition  is typically lower and  accordingly  when we can expect to receive higher prices 
with the acquisition of the columbia tree farm in  management expected a decrease in the seasonality of fee timber operations as the columbia tree farm is at higher elevations where harvest activities are generally possible only in the late spring and summer months 
in practice  over the last two years our harvest has tended to be more front loaded  as log prices have been relatively strong in the first half of the year and winter weather has been relatively benign  enabling management to front load the harvest plan 
in future periods  management expects quarterly harvest volume to be affected by both local market conditions for logs and weather conditions 
timberland management consulting 
timberland management consulting operations are not significantly seasonal 
real estate 
while real estate results are not expected to be seasonal  the nature of the activities in this segment will likely result in periodic large transactions that will have significant positive impacts on both revenue and operating income of the partnership in periods in which these transactions close  and relatively limited revenue and income in other periods 
while the lumpiness of these results is not primarily a function of seasonal weather patterns  we do expect to see some seasonal fluctuations in this segment because of the general effects of weather on pacific northwest development activities 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingencies our commitments at december  consist of operating leases  and purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
payments due by period commitment expiration period obligation or commitment in s total less than year years years after years total debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations we have debt totaling million with the contractual maturities described in note of the partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report 
our million revolving line of credit expired on october  and was not renewed 
the partnership has committed to invest of the total equity capital in orm timber fund i  lp once a timberland acquisition is closed by the fund 
committed capital for this fund is million so the partnership s commitment  accordingly  is million 
the partnership and other limited partners will make this investment once timberland properties have been acquired 
unconditional purchase obligations represent contracted infrastructure construction at the gig harbor property 
other long term obligations include the partnership s  contingent liability for environmental remediation in and around the port gamble townsite and  liability for a supplemental employment retirement plan 
the partnership may from time to time be a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that loss to the partnership  if any  will not have a material adverse effect to the partnership s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the partnership is not a party to off balance sheet arrangements and does not hold any variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
capital expenditures and commitments projected capital expenditures in are million excluding the planned investment in orm timber fund i  lp 
projected capital expenditures are currently expected to include million for the gig harbor site and million for the bremerton site 
the partnership also expects to make over half of its planned investment in the timber fund of million in these expenditures could be increased or decreased as a consequence of future economic conditions 
projected capital expenditures at the gig harbor and bremerton site are subject to permitting timetables and progress towards closing on specific land sale transactions 
government regulation compliance with laws  regulations  and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as operating costs 
we cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with laws  regulations  and demands  or the effects on operating costs  because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive 
accordingly  at this time we have not included herein a quantification of future capital requirements to comply with any new regulations being developed by the united states or canadian regulatory agencies 
additionally  many federal and state environmental regulations  as well as local zoning and land use ordinances  place limits upon various aspects of our operations 
these limits include restrictions on our harvest methods and volumes  remediation requirements that may increase our post harvest reclamation costs  esa limitations on our ability to harvest in certain areas  zoning and development restrictions that impact our real estate segment  and a wide range of other existing and pending statutes and regulations 
various initiatives are presented from time to time that seek further restrictions on timber and real estate development businesses  and although management currently is not aware of any material noncompliance with applicable law  we cannot assure readers that we ultimately will be successful in complying with all such regulations or that additional regulations will not ultimately have a material adverse impact upon our business 
accounting matters accounting standards not yet implemented in december  the fasb released its revised standard  sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the vesting period 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on its current fair value and the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
adoption of sfas r is required for fiscal years beginning after june  the partnership is evaluating sfas r and believes it will likely result in recognition of additional non cash equity based compensation expense and accordingly would decrease net income in amounts  which likely will be considered material 
the partnership has obtained commitments of million for orm timber fund i  lp the fund  which includes pope resources commitment to invest million of that capital 
these capital commitments are not actually paid until a timberland acquisition is completed 
the fund is now seeking suitable timberland investments 
in accordance with eitf  determining when general partners are required to consolidate limited partners we presently expect the fund to be consolidated into the partnership s financial statements since an indirect subsidiary of the partnership olympic resource management llc will act as manager and general partner of the fund 
the limited partners interest in the fund  excluding pope resources  is expected to be presented as minority interest in the partnership s consolidated balance sheet and  furthermore  the profit or loss allocated to the limited partners is expected to be presented as minority interest in the partnership s consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management believes its most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to management s calculation of timber depletion and liabilities for matters such as environmental remediation  and potential asset impairments 
in relation to liabilities  potential impairments and other estimated charges  it is management s policy to conduct ongoing reviews of significant accounting policies and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial results of the partnership 
the assumptions used are tested against available and relevant information and reviewed with subject matter experts for consistency and reliability 
during the preparation of financial results  tests are conducted to ascertain that the net book carrying values of assets are not in excess of estimated future cash flows 
these tests use current market information  if available  or other generally accepted valuation methods  such as future cash flows 
when the use of estimates is necessary  an exact answer is unlikely  and therefore  the range of likely outcomes is used in the preparation of the financial statements 
tests are also applied in order to be reasonably assured that liabilities are properly reflected on the records of the partnership and that the notes to the financial statements are prepared in a fashion that informs readers of possible outcomes and risks associated with the conduct of business 
purchased timberland cost allocation 
when the partnership acquires timberlands  a purchase price allocation is performed that allocates cost between the categories of merchantable timber  premerchantable timber  and land based upon the relative fair values pertaining to each of the categories 
when timberland is acquired the land is evaluated for current value 
to the extent the land has value under current market conditions as something other than timberland  we assign a value greater than that typically associated with timberland 
depletion 
depletion represents the cost of timber harvested and the amortized cost of the permanent road system and is charged to operations by applying a depletion rate to volume harvested during the period 
the depletion rate is calculated on january st of each year by dividing the partnership s cost of merchantable timber and the cost of the permanent road system by the volume of merchantable timber 
for purposes of the depletion calculation  merchantable timber is defined as timber that is equal to or greater than years of age 
to calculate the depletion rate the partnership uses a combined pool when the characteristics of the acquired timber are not significantly different from the partnership s existing timberlands 
prior to the fourth quarter of  all of the partnership s timberlands were aggregated into one depletion cost pool 
the partnership acquired approximately  acres of timberland in the last quarter of that was accounted for in two separate depletion pools 
these acquisitions were almost entirely merchantable timber  which made the inventory characteristics of these acquisitions sufficiently different from our existing timber pool to indicate separate depletion pools were warranted under our accounting policy 
harvest activities for one of these separate depletion pools was completed in  the other was harvested in and and the remainder is expected to be harvested in we expect to harvest approximately mmbf from one of these separate pools in resulting in depletion cost of million 
the depletion cost on this harvest is expected to approximate the net stumpage realized on the sale  which will result in relatively little net income impact from the harvest but will generate operating cash flow 
as a result of this additional depletion in we expect the overall weighted average depletion rate in will be approximately mbf which represents a decline from mbf in as the partnership plans to harvest less timber in from the separate depletion pool 
the depletion rate on the partnership s pooled timber in is expected to be per mbf 
timber inventory volumes take into account the applicable state and federal regulatory limits on timber harvests as applied to the partnership s properties  including the forests and fish law that supplements washington state s forest practice regulations to provide for expanded riparian management zones  wildlife leave trees  and other harvest restrictions 
timber inventory volume is accounted for by the partnership s standing timber inventory system  which utilizes annual statistical sampling of the timber cruising together with adjustments made for estimated annual growth and the depletion of areas harvested 
the standing inventory system is subject to two processes each year to monitor accuracy 
the first is the annual cruise process and the second is a comparison of a volume actually extracted by harvest to b inventory in the standing inventory system at the time of the harvest 
a cruise  which utilizes statistical sampling techniques  represents a physical measurement of timber on a specific set of acres 
the cruise process is completed when the physical measurement totals are compared to the volume captured in the standing inventory system 
only productive acres with timber that is at least years old are selected as subject to a cruise 
the partnership cruised of its productive acres with year old or greater timber in and in and and plans to cruise of productive acres in specific acres are first selected for cruising with a bias towards those acres that have gone the longest without a cruise and  second  with a bias towards those acres that have been growing the longest 
as the cruise is being performed  only those trees with a breast height diameter approximately feet from the ground of at least inches are measured for inclusion in the inventory 
a change in estimated timber inventory volume would have changed depletion expense by  environmental remediation 
the environmental remediation liability represents estimated payments to be made to monitor and remedy if necessary certain areas in and around the townsite and millsite of port gamble  washington 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned and operated by p t  a related party  until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to operate the townsite until and leased the millsite at port gamble through january  at which point p t signed an agreement with the partnership dividing the responsibility for environmental remediation of port gamble between the two parties 
the environmental remediation liability on the partnership s books is based upon an estimate of the partnership s portion of the clean up costs under this agreement with p t 
while the majority of the partnership s portion of the clean up efforts is complete  there remains the possibility that the remaining remediation or monitoring activities may exceed estimates  resulting in an additional environmental remediation charge 
management will continue to monitor the remaining liability against estimates to complete to determine if an adjustment to the environmental remediation liability is necessary to accurately represent management s estimate of remaining cost to complete the project 
land held for development 
land held for development represents the partnership s cost basis in land that has been identified as having greater value as development than timber property 
our real estate segment works with these properties to establish entitlements with city and county officials that allow for further development 
these entitlement costs are evaluated for capitalization based upon the expected value derived from the efforts 
for example  costs incurred to change urban growth area boundaries are expensed as incurred due to the difficulty of successfully changing these boundaries but the cost of applying for a preliminary plat is generally capitalized as these efforts have a high likelihood of success and thus increase the value of the property 
those properties that are either under contract or where the partnership is planning to sell within the next months are classified as a current asset under land held for sale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   the partnership had million of fixed rate debt outstanding with a fair value of approximately million based on the current interest rates for similar financial instruments 
a change in the interest rate on fixed rate debt will affect the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on variable rate debt will affect interest expense and cash flows 
a hypothetical change in prevailing interest rates would change the fair value of the partnership s fixed rate long term debt obligations by million
