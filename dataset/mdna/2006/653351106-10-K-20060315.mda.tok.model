item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item above and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which appear in item of this report 
in this discussion and analysis  we explain our financial condition and results of operations 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows we provide an introduction and overview of our business activities 
we discuss additional factors affecting comparability of results and operations 
we discuss our critical accounting policies 
we discuss recent accounting pronouncements 
we discuss the results of our continuing operations for the year ended december   compared with results for the years ended december  and we discuss our financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and our contractual obligations 
introduction and overview our business has undergone significant change  and consequently our financial results and condition are difficult to compare from one year to the next 
as discussed in item under recent developments  our business may change further in the future 
to the extent we make additional changes to our business or our strategy  future year to year comparisons may continue to be difficult and our financial condition and results may continue to change 
in  we sold our mobile and wireless data businesses 
for information on these dispositions  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations 
these businesses accounted for all of the operating revenue and a significant portion of the operating expenses that we reported prior to commencing our mbs business in as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we have restated prior periods to reflect the presentation of the mobile and wireless data businesses as discontinued operations  so that year to year results are comparable 
as a company that owns and manages a portfolio of mbs  we no longer report revenue  cost of revenue or gross profit 
instead  our income statement consists primarily of interest income and expense  realized and unrealized gains on mbs transactions  other than temporary impairments  if any  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our balance sheet includes primarily cash and cash equivalents  investments  repurchase agreements reflecting funds borrowed to leverage our mbs portfolio  interest receivable and payable and other less significant assets and liabilities 
in october we repurchased the outstanding portion of our convertible subordinated notes that were due in march prior to this time  the interest expense on these notes  million of which were outstanding during  represented a material portion of our expenses 
we began implementing our mbs strategy at the end of june since that time  there have been significant changes in the size of our mbs portfolio  the amount of interest income we receive from those investments  and the amount of interest expense we pay 
see item business for a discussion of recent market conditions that have led to a decline in the size of our mbs portfolio and the amount of our leverage since the middle of in the course of repositioning our business  we reduced the size of our corporate staff significantly and currently have a staff of seven employees 
our corporate office is located in a leased facility in baltimore  maryland 
this location is our sole operating location 
all other existing leases  except for the lease of the massachusetts facility that we have sublet to the buyer of our mobile government business  expired during the first quarter of our general and administrative expenses have been significantly lowered  although we will still incur costs associated with being a public company  including insurance  audit and other outside professional services  compliance and various regulatory fees 
we also will continue to incur fees for our outside investment and financial advisors 
additional factors affecting the comparability of results and operations certain items included in our results of operations have varied significantly from one year to the next  making it difficult to compare our overall results from year to year 
these items are discussed below 
in general  as discussed below  we do not expect these items to have a material impact on our results of operations in the future 
we recorded an impairment charge of million million to goodwill and million to intangible assets related to discontinued operations during we repeated the impairment analysis each year  beginning with a recurring annual measurement date chosen by us and the review resulted in an additional impairment charge to goodwill of million 
all of these amounts are included in loss from discontinued operations 
we performed this analysis again in september and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill at that time 
during the second quarter of  with the potential future sale of the transportation and mobile government businesses  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government goodwill and recorded impairment charges related to goodwill of million and million  respectively 
these impairments are reflected in discontinued operations 
after the sale of the ems  transportation and mobile government businesses  we no longer have any goodwill on our balance sheet 
during  we recorded impairment charges to intangibles and other long lived assets of million 
of this charge  million related to continuing operations and  and  related to ems and transportation  respectively  which are reported as discontinued operations 
during  with the potential future sale of the transportation and mobile government businesses  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government intangibles and other long lived assets and recorded non cash impairment charges related to transportation intangibles and other assets of million and million  respectively and reported as discontinued operations 
after the sale of the ems  transportation and mobile government businesses  we no longer have any intangible assets on our balance sheet 
during  we recorded a net gain of  which included impairment charges of  related to our equity investments 
the remainder of the net gain resulted from sales of investments 
in  we recorded a net loss of million  which included a million loss on the liquidation of our investments available for sale consisting of highly liquid us government agency sponsored securities 
the loss was partially offset by a gain of million relating to the sale of other equity investments 
as of december  and  our investment balances were primarily related to mbs and cash equivalents 
as a result of the decline in the profitability of our leveraged mbs portfolio  our recent decision to repay the leveraged portion of our mbs portfolio  and our decision to evaluate additional and alternative business opportunities that may require the sale of some or all of our remaining mbs  management does not continue to have the firm intention to hold existing mbs investments until maturity or until such time as the market value of those securities has recovered 
accordingly  we determined that unrealized losses in the mbs portfolio at december  should be considered other than temporary impairments under statement of accounting standards and should be charged against operating results as of that date 
this decision reflects a change in our intention to hold all mbs until a recovery of fair value occurs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized the unrealized loss of approximately million and wrote off the unamortized premium of million for the total other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million 
the fair value of the mbs portfolio will continued to be evaluated and any additional reductions in market values that are determined to be other than temporary impairments will be included in results from continuing operations 
from through  we implemented expense reduction plans as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies  the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses and ultimately facilitate the transition to our mbs business 
these efforts included in the consolidation of excess facilities and a significant reduction in our workforce 
as of december   we had a total of seven employees  and all of them were located at our principal office in baltimore  maryland 
employee separation benefits under the restructuring plans include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs and other costs included expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
as of december   there was no accrued liability related to restructuring activities 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies affect the amount of income and expense we record in each period as well as the value of our assets and liabilities and our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities 
in applying these critical accounting policies  we must make estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements that  if made differently  could have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and appropriate  in light of applicable accounting rules 
however  estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies  which the securities and exchange commission defines as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because management must make estimates about uncertain and changing matters 
mortgage backed securities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires the company to classify its investments as trading investments  available for sale investments or held to maturity investments 
currently  the company classifies all of its mbs as available for sale 
all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market pricing estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers who make markets in these financial instruments  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in operating results and the cost basis of the securities is adjusted 
interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the securities are amortized accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the interest method in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  market place consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mbs increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing our net yield on mbs 
if we used different prepayment estimates  the amounts we report for interest income could be materially different 
mbs transactions are recorded on the trade date 
purchases of newly issued securities are recorded when all significant uncertainties regarding the characteristics of the securities are removed  generally shortly before settlement date 
realized gains and losses on sales transactions are determined on the specific identification basis 
valuation of deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets as a result of years of accumulated tax loss carryforwards 
management believes we will achieve profitable operations in future years that may enable us to recover the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
however  we presently do not have sufficient objective evidence to support management s belief and  accordingly  we maintain a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
guarantees we have certain guarantees related to assigned leases 
we also agreed to maintain a letter of credit as collateral assurance of performance for a significant customer contract that was assigned to the buyer of our mobile government business in connection with the sale of that business 
these arrangements have been evaluated in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  and we have recorded a total liability of approximately  in respect to these arrangements 
this liability is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet 
the estimated fair value of the liability was calculated based on an analysis of multiple scenarios and the estimated probability of those scenarios based on discussions with personnel closely involved with the project 
had we used different estimates  the liability that we recorded could have differed materially 
recent accounting pronouncments in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 titled share based payments statement no 
r 
statement no 
r requires that share based payments  such as grants of stock options  restricted shares  and stock appreciation rights  be measured at fair value and reported as expense in a company s financial statements over the requisite service period 
the company periodically issues share based payments to employees under its compensation programs and has elected to make pro forma disclosures under the current accounting guidance 
the company is required to adopt statement no 
r for the quarter beginning january  beginning in that quarter  the company will recognize expense over the service period for the fair value of all grants issued after january   as well as expense attributable to the remaining service period for all prior grants that have not fully vested by that date 
at this time  the company does not expect the effect of adopting statement no 
r to be significantly different from the impact on net earnings reported under the disclosure provisions of the existing accounting literature 
results of continuing operations in this section  when we discuss the results of our operations  we will be talking about our mbs business  which we refer to as continuing operations 
we did not begin implementing our mbs business until the end of june and accordingly  earnings related to our mbs business were significantly higher during the year ended december   as compared to loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in from a loss of million in the reduction in the amount of the loss reflects an increase in earnings from our mbs portfolio  as we substantially expanded the size of that portfolio in the first half of  and a decline in expenses as we streamlined our corporate infrastructure in the first half of to reflect the needs of our mbs business 
as discussed above  because management has now concluded that it does not continue to have the firm intention to hold existing mbs investments until maturity  or such time as the market value has recovered  we determined consistent with the requirements of gaap that unrealized losses in the portfolio should be considered other than temporary impairments 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in loss from continuing operations 
the write off of unamortized premiums of  that we paid to purchase mbs was included as part of this million impairment charge 
had we not incurred this charge  we would have reported net income from continuing operations of approximately  for the outstanding balance of our mbs portfolio will decline significantly during as a result of the sale approximately million of mbs that we entered into on march  to de lever our mbs portfolio  along with principal repayments that we will continue to receive during the year 
consequently  absent a significant change in market conditions and a decision to purchase additional mbs  our interest income from our mbs portfolio also will decline 
although we do not anticipate significant losses from continuing operations in  costs incurred in connection with our examination of additional strategic business opportunities are likely to increase our expenses in losses from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decline was primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses resulting from our restructuring activities 
in october  we redeemed all of the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes at a price of and realized a million loss on the early extinguishment 
the loss  however  was offset by lower interest expense as a result of the redemption 
if we had not redeemed these notes  we would have been required to pay million of interest on the notes through their maturity in march interest income from mbs portfolio we began implementing our mbs strategy in late june of  and as of december   we owned approximately million of mbs 
we purchased additional mbs during the first half of  and after investing million of our cash in mbs utilized borrowings under our repurchase agreements to finance additional mbs purchases 
during  the interest earned on the portfolio was approximately million  net of premium amortization and custodian fees 
in the fourth quarter of because the interest we were earning on our short term investments was less than the interest we were paying on short term borrowings to leverage our mbs portfolio  we used approximately million of available cash to repay a portion of borrowings 
these repayments and the corresponding reduction in leverage on our portfolio increased our net equity in mbs to approximately million 
after completion of the sales of mbs in march the repayment of all of our outstanding borrowings under our repurchase agreements and receipt of normal prepayments on our mbs received during the first quarter of  our net investment in mbs will again be million or less 
interest income from our mbs increased million to million in from  in our mbs portfolio at the beginning of consisted of two mbs 
during the first two quarters of  we invested an additional million in mbs and began to leverage the portfolio 
in light of increasing short term interest rates and the reduction in the spread between the interest income we earn on our mbs portfolio and the interest expense we incur to finance our purchases  we have not purchased any mbs since may in addition  since may  our mbs portfolio has declined from million to million at december  as a result of mbs sales totaling million on which we realized net gains of  and principal repayments on our mbs in the ordinary course 
interest earned on mbs varies as a result of changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds as well as the size of our mbs portfolio 
changes in both interest rates and prepayment speeds are uncertain and represent principal risks of our mbs strategy 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of mbs  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mbs increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on mbs 
cpr s in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve 
in general  cpr s tend to fall during periods of rising interest rates 
although rates have increased throughout the second half of  the cpr s for our mbs have not declined as would be expected 
this may be the result of borrowers refinancing to convert adjustable rate loans to fixed rates loans 
the weighted average yield on our mbs portfolio was for the year ending december   compared to for the year ending december  the weighted average yield on the mbs portfolio increased during as a result of higher interest rates payable on the mbs securities that we purchased in the first and second quarter of this increase was partially offset by an increase in premium amortization due to higher weighted average cpr during this period 
in the second half of  our weighted average yield on our mbs portfolio declined slightly as a result of sales of certain higher coupon mbs in june and september along with additional premium amortization resulting from increases in weighted average cpr 
the following table presents key metrics of our mbs  for the quarterly periods presented quarter ended weighted average coupon weighted average cpr weighted average yield december  march  june  september  december  interest income from cash and cash equivalents interest income from cash and cash equivalents was  in compared to  in this represents cash allocated to our mbs business that was temporarily invested in short term us government agency sponsored cash equivalents  rather than in mbs 
the decrease in interest income from these temporary investments was the result in a decline in the average balance of such investments during the period 
interest expense on repurchase agreements interest expense on repurchase agreements varies based upon the interest rates we are charged as well as the average amount of borrowings that we have outstanding 
the amount of outstanding borrowings varies based upon purchases and sales of mbs and mbs prepayments received 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements have been short term obligations  which have generally matured on a monthly basis 
as a result  as short term interest rates increased during  the interest rates charged under our repurchase agreements increased 
interest expense on repurchase agreements was million in we did not begin leveraging our mbs portfolio until the first quarter of  therefore  there was no comparable interest expense incurred in while interest rates charged on our short term borrowings under repurchase agreements increased during the second half of  the average amount borrowed during this period declined  as we used proceeds from sales of mbs and prepayments to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
the following table presents key metrics of our repurchase agreements  for the periods presented quarter ended average outstanding balance of borrowings weighted average interest rate at quarter end weighted average days to maturity at quarter end weighted average cost of funds for the quarter ended in thousands december  march  june  september  december  net interest spread our interest rate spread  which represents the difference between the weighted average yield on our mbs and the weighted average cost of funds on our repurchase agreements  was negative for the quarter ended december   compared to a positive spread of  and for the quarters ended september   june  and march   respectively 
the decline in interest rate spread during the second half of reflects the increase in short term interest rates and the decrease in yield resulting from sales of higher coupon mbs in late june of the increase in the interest rate spread during the second quarter of resulted primarily from the purchase of higher coupon mbs during the second quarter  which was partially offset by increases in our short term borrowing rates during the quarter 
gain on sale of mortgaged backed securities in  we recognized a net gain of  on sales of million in mbs as compared to a net gain of million on sales of million in the estimated face value of mbs forward purchase commitments during the third quarter of in september  we sold approximately million of mbs and recognized a loss of  in june  we sold approximately million of mbs and recognized a gain of  in july  we sold mbs forward purchase commitments and recognized a gain of million 
other than temporary impairment on mortgage backed securities as of december   in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recognized the unrealized loss of approximately million and wrote off the unamortized premium of million for the total other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million  as discussed in item under the heading recent developments 
operating expenses during the first quarter of we substantially completed transitional activities that related to ongoing obligations we had to the buyers of our transportation and mobile government businesses 
we have streamlined our corporate infrastructure to the level required to support our ongoing mbs business and do not anticipate any significant further declines in operating expenses 
costs incurred in connection with our examination and additional or alternative strategic business opportunities  as discussed above in item a risk factors other risk of our business  may result in an increase in our expenses during from current levels 
our operating expenses declined significantly in and  primarily due to the results of our restructuring efforts  in which we streamlined our organization and reduced our workforce 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related costs  rent  facility related support costs  along with costs of outside professionals  including legal counsel  accountants and investment bankers 
sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decline reflects primarily the results of streamlining our corporate infrastructure to align it with the needs of our mbs business and as a result of the sale of our mobile and wireless data businesses 
of the decrease  approximately million was related to personnel reductions 
other major components of the decrease include reductions in insurance of  professional fees of million  facility costs of  and telecommunications costs of  in  we incurred approximately million of investment banking and advisory fees associated with the evaluation and implementation of our mbs strategy and the sale of our historic operating businesses 
we did not incur similar fees in sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in of the decrease  million is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
facility and travel costs decreased approximately  and  respectively 
additional expense reductions were partially offset by a million increase in investment banking fees paid in these investment banking fees included  related to the implementation of our mbs strategy  including  paid to our investment advisor fbr for assisting with the development and launch of the mbs strategy  and  paid to a third party investment banker to provide our management and our board of directors with a report on evaluating the proposed mbs strategy 
investment advisor fees fees paid to fbr our outside investment manager  to manage and provide advice relative to our mbs portfolio  were  for  compared to  for the increase in fees reflects the growth of our mbs portfolio  as fbr s fee is based on the amount of mbs we own 
in addition  fbr was only engaged for approximately six months during compared to a full year in fbr is also entitled to an incentive fee based upon overall returns from the mbs portfolio  but did not qualify for such incentive fee during or based upon the current size of our mbs portfolio and  the commitment we entered into with jefferies to sell approximately million of our mbs with settlement on march   we do not expect fbr to qualify for the incentive fee in unless market conditions change significantly and we decide to purchase significant additional mbs and leverage our portfolio 
depreciation depreciation expenses arise from property and equipment purchased for use in our operations 
depreciation decreased million  or  to  in from million in the decrease reflects primarily the impact of our transition from our mobile and wireless data businesses to our mbs business including the associated streamlining of our corporate infrastructure 
this included disposing of fixed assets that were no longer needed to support our continuing operations 
as we have now completed the streamlining process  we expect our depreciation expense to remain at approximately its current level in the future 
depreciation decreased  or  to million in from million in as a result of asset impairment charges recorded during and  the carrying value of our long lived assets declined  resulting in lower depreciation 
this was offset partially by accelerated depreciation on certain assets that we took out of service during stock compensation expense stock compensation expense represents the cost associated with the grants of restricted stock and decreased approximately  from to and by approximately  from to the decreases result primarily from the reduction of our work force and the vesting of restricted stock grants 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment in the first quarter of beginning in that quarter  we will recognize compensation expense over the service period for the fair value of all grants issued after january   as well as expense attributable to the remaining service period for all prior grants that have not fully vested by that date 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we will no longer be able to recognize forfeitures as they occur  but will be required to estimate the number of forfeitures 
as of december   we had unamortized compensation expense of approximately  based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the change in the method of recognizing forfeitures is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
of the total unamortized expense  the majority of the remaining expense is expected to be recognized during therefore  we do not expect the effect of adopting sfas no 
r to be significantly different from the impact on net earnings reported under the disclosure provisions of the existing accounting literature 
other expense income other income in was approximately  and represents primarily income from the sale of fully depreciated fixed assets such as computer equipment and furniture that were taken out of service during our restructuring efforts associated with the transition to our mbs business 
in september  we received a royalty payment of  relating to a prior investment in a company that we acquired in other expense for was approximately  primarily attributable to the cost of a litigation settlement 
other expense was approximately  for  reflecting primarily a loss on disposal of our corporate aircraft  partially offset by gains on the disposal of other assets that we sold in other interest income in  other interest income consists primarily of interest income on the million subordinated secured promissory note issued by bio key in connection with the sale of our mobile government business and interest income on cash equivalents and investments with maturities of less than months 
other interest income was million for  as compared to million in the decrease results primarily from a decline in the average cash and investment balances not employed by our mbs business during the year  partially offset by rising interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we used million of our available cash to pay down borrowings associated with our mbs portfolio 
during and  other interest income consists primarily of interest from cash equivalents and investments with a maturity of less than months 
other interest income decreased approximately million from to as the result of a decreasing cash and investment balance as we continued to consume cash to fund our business and to redeem in our convertible subordinated notes  combined with decreased interest rates 
during  we invested a substantial portion of our available cash in our mbs portfolio  and interest on such amounts is reported as interest income from mbs portfolio  as discussed above 
interest expense on subordinated notes payable  gain loss on early extinguishment of debt in october  we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
prior to that time  we incurred interest expense on these subordinated notes which decreased by million from to because of the redemption of the subordinated notes in october no further interest expense was incurred after the redemption of the notes 
when we redeemed all of our then outstanding convertible subordinated notes at a price of in accordance with the terms of those notes  we realized a million loss  which consisted of a million premium on the redemption and the recognition of approximately  in unamortized deferred financing costs 
the early retirement of the debt resulted in a savings of million in interest expense on the notes that we would have been required to pay through their maturity in march equity in losses of investments equity in losses of investments were  during and consisted of our proportionate share of the net losses in our investments over which we exercised significant influence and as such accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we have not held any of these investments since and do not currently anticipate making additional investments of this type in the future 
investment gain loss  net investment loss was  in  as compared to  in the loss of  in reflected losses realized upon the sale of all of the remaining long term investments we had in that were not related to our mbs portfolio 
the investment loss in consisted of a million loss on the liquidation of our investments available for sale consisting of highly liquid us government agency sponsored securities 
the loss was partially offset by a gain of million relating to the sale of other investments 
in  we realized net investment gains of  from the sale of eight venture investments 
we sold our last remaining venture investment in sales of discontinued operations in  we sold our mobile and wireless data businesses  which were organized into three operating segments 
in january  we sold our ems segment for million in cash and a million note which was paid in full in august 
in september we sold our transportation and mobile government businesses for million in cash and million in cash  respectively 
for information on these dispositions  see notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
financial condition during  our total assets increased by approximately million  while our total liabilities increased by approximately million 
these changes reflect primarily the fact that we borrowed funds pursuant to short term repurchase agreements to purchase additional mbs 
our borrowings at december  were approximately million  we had no borrowings at december  while we used all of these borrowings and most of our remaining cash and cash equivalents to purchase mbs we recognized the unrealized loss of approximately million and wrote off the unamortized premium of million for the total other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million 
changes in our assets other than cash and cash equivalents and mbs  and changes in our liabilities other than repurchase agreements were limited in the most significant change was a million decline in prepaid expenses and other assets 
this decline reflects the sale proceeds of million for various non mbs investments  which we sold in late but for which we did not receive proceeds until  plus the write off of a  receivable and a  working capital adjustment in connection with the resolution of a post closing purchase price adjustment relating to the sale of our transportation business to geologic 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of the company to meet its financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is provided from cash generated by operations  principal and interest payments received on mbs and additional financing  as necessary 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and available repurchase agreements 
the company believes it currently has sufficient liquidity to meet current operations and planned business growth 
however  if we decide to pursue one or more new business opportunities we may need to sell some or all of our mbs investments to fund the acquisition or development of such new business opportunities 
see item risk factors risks of our current business for a discussion of the risks associated with selling our mbs under adverse market conditions 
in such situations  we may realize additional losses on our investments 
the following table reflects use of net cash for operations  investing  and financing activities in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million and approximately million for and  respectively 
historically  our operations have not been profitable  however  due to a substantial reduction in operating expenses  the operating activities from our mbs business provided net cash in our current mbs business requires significantly less operational expenses compared to our previous mobile and wireless data business 
in addition  our mobile and wireless data business had significant net losses compared to our mbs business 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for  which primarily related to approximately million used to purchase mbs  partially offset by approximately million of principal repayments on our mbs that we received and the sale of approximately million of mbs 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for  consisting primarily of a net amount of approximately million from the purchase and sale of investments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities 
additionally  we used approximately million to purchase mbs and received approximately million  approximately million  and approximately million from the sale of our ems  transportation  and mobile government businesses  respectively  net of transaction expenses  and received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of other investments 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in we received approximately million for the net sale of short term and non current investment instruments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities  and we used approximately  for the purchase of property and equipment which was sold as part of the dispositions we completed in and received approximately million from sales of certain property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for  which primarily related to the funding we received through repurchase agreements to purchase mbs 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for  consisting primarily of approximately million used to redeem the remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes  as discussed above under the heading interest expense on subordinated notes payable  gain loss on early extinguishment of debt 
we also received approximately million of cash upon the release of collateral relating to certain letters of credit that expired in net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for during  financing activities included the investment of approximately million of cash in certificates of deposit  which was used as collateral against certain letters of credit 
in addition  we received approximately million from the exercise of employee options and warrants 
during  the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal and interest payments received on its portfolio of mbs  and other cash flows generated by operations 
the company s most significant uses of cash have included purchases of mbs and continue to include payments to fund operations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  combined with the cash flows from operations and the utilization of available borrowings  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated liquidity requirements 
at december   we had master repurchase arrangements in place with five counterparties  covering up to an aggregate of at least million of borrowings 
as of that date  we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding 
on march   we entered into to commitment with jefferies to sell million of our mbs 
the terms we received from jefferies were as good as or better than the terms offered by other investment banks 
this sale will settle on march   and we intend to use approximately million to repay all of our remaining outstanding borrowings under repurchase agreements 
our financial condition may also be affected by claims relating to the mobile and wireless data businesses that we sold during under the definitive purchase agreements that we signed to affect those sales  we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of those businesses for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we provided to them with respect to the sales of the businesses 
in addition  we remain liable for the operation of each of the business segments prior to their dispositions 
we also have retained liability for certain continuing obligations associated with the mobile government segment 
in addition  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  we have resolved one dispute with geologic  the buyer of our transportation segment  and have been notified by geologic of additional significant potential indemnity claims against us 
on march   geologic filed a claim against us in the supreme court for the state of new york 
we believe that geologic s claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them  however  we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  and an adverse resolution of such claims could require us to make a significant cash payment to geologic 
in such event  we would record a charge against discontinued operations  further increasing the loss on the sale of the transportation segment 
we have not received any indemnity claims from the buyers of our other two mobile and wireless data businesses  and most of the indemnification provisions relating to the sale of our ems segment have now expired 
most of the indemnification provisions relating to the other two businesses will continue through the first quarter of contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual commitments  including our future minimum lease payments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations facility leases less subleases facility leases  net other purchase obligations total the chart above does not include guarantee obligations that the company continues to have with respect to two leases used for discontinued operations that the company has assigned to third parties 
the company is no longer the primary lessee 
the maximum aggregate amount owed under these leases is approximately  and both leases expire in the fair value of the guarantee is not material as of december  as of december   million of the our certificates of deposit were held on deposit to collateralize an irrevocable standby letter of credit that was put in place when our former mobile government business entered into a sales agreement with hamilton county  ohio to provide an automated field reporting solution and real time wireless data infrastructure under a sales agreement 
the letter of credit provides collateral assurance of performance under the sales agreement 
the terms of the sales agreement and the standby letter of credit state that hamilton county can only draw on the letter of credit after completing the internal dispute resolution process set forth in the sales agreement and providing notice to mobile government of its intent to declare a default under the sales agreement and proceed against the letter of credit 
a draw of the funds under the standby letter of credit is subject to the limitations of liability contained in the sales agreement 
the letter of credit is required to remain in place through december  for a more detailed discussion of these matters  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have not included contracts for maintenance support on hardware or software that we own because we generally pay in advance for these services and have the option of choosing whether or not to renew these services each year 
we have also not included in this table potential contingent liabilities that we may have to the buyers of our ems  transportation or mobile government businesses  under the terms of the purchase agreements with the buyers and we cannot readily estimate the potential amount of liabilities that might arise in the future  if any 
potential liabilities to the buyers of our mobile and wireless data businesses are discussed in item a under the heading risk factors risks associated with our mobile and wireless data businesses 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the lease guarantees and the collateral assurance in support of bio key s performance obligations under the hamilton county  ohio project  which are described above we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  and prepayment risks inherent in our mbs strategy in a responsible manner designed to promote our growth and success while  at the same time  seeking to maximize stockholder value 
we are not planning to be averse to risk  but are aiming to assume only those risks we believe we can manage and which we believe will produce a sufficient return to justify taking those risks 
at december   the value of our mbs portfolio exceeded our outstanding borrowings by times 
since july  the federal reserve has increased the federal funds rate by  which has caused corresponding increases in short term interest rates and directly impacted our borrowing costs associated with leveraging our mbs portfolio 
in addition  during that same period  the interest rate yield curve has flattened and is currently inverted  as short term interest rates have increased more then increases in longer term interest rates 
as a result of these market conditions  the spread between the interest income we earn on additional mbs purchases and the related borrowing cost associated with funding those purchases was negative as of december  these current market conditions have adversely impacted the valuation of our mbs portfolio  which has negatively affected our results of operations 
interest rate risk all of our existing mbs are hybrid  adjustable rate mbs and are subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the interest rate payable on our mbs 
hybrid adjustable rate mbs typically include periodic caps on the interest rates on the underlying mortgages generally  rate adjustments are limited to every twelve months following the initial rate adjustment  as well as lifetime caps 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions and therefore  in a period of rising short term interest rates  such as currently exist  the interest rates on our borrowings increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mbs may not experience corresponding increases as discussed above  we expect to have no outstanding borrowings associated with our mbs portfolio by the end of the first quarter of although the repayment of debt would eliminate the risks associated with changes in our interest expense  interest income on mbs still will vary as a result of changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds and the size of our mbs portfolio 
changes in both interest rates and prepayment speeds are uncertain and represent principal risks of our mbs strategy 
if we do not repay our outstanding borrowings under repurchase agreements or incur additional borrowings in the future  and if short term interest rates continue to rise  we may continue to experience or may in the future again experience a negative interest rate spread on the leveraged portion of our mbs portfolio 
as explained above  our borrowings do not have periodic or lifetime interest rate caps similar to our mbs 
as a result  the interest rate on our borrowings and the costs associated with such borrowings can increase without limitation  which would negatively impact our earnings 
the unleveraged mbs in our portfolio will continue to be subject to additional fluctuations in market value 
as a result  any future declines that are determined to be other than temporary would be charged against future operating results 
market value risk our mbs investments are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie market value  with any adjustment between cost and fair value  not considered to be other than temporary  reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the balance sheet 
as discussed above  for a number of reasons resulting from recent events and decisions  we determined that unrealized losses in its mbs portfolio at december  should be considered other than temporary impairments 
as of december   the cost basis of our mbs was written down to fair value  and we recorded a million impairment charge in our operating results included within loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of the chart below illustrates the effect on portfolio value should interest rates rapidly increase or decrease by   and basis points 
we have estimated the impact of rate shocks will be parallel to each other  based on the current yield curve 
changes in interest rates that cause a decline in the projected market value in the mbs portfolio  as noted below  will also have a corresponding impact on our future earnings should the declines be considered other than temporary impairments under statement of accounting standards our portfolio of mbs as of december  was valued at million  and mbs market values have continued to decline in the first quarter of assumptions made in calculating the impact on our mbs portfolio value from interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayments and yield spread of mbs relative to prevailing interest rates 
change in interest rate projected change in mbs portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mbs with short term borrowings  as discussed above an in item a risk factors 
continued increases in short term interest rates have negatively impacted the valuation of our mbs  which could limit our borrowing ability or cause our counter parties under our master repurchase arrangements to initiate margin calls 
this would increase our liquidity needs and could reduce our ability to borrow or require us to sell a portion of our mbs investments at a time when their market value is below our cost 
in addition  continued increases in short term interest rates will increase our interest costs and reduce future earnings 
the anticipated repayment of all of our remaining mbs related debt in the first quarter of will eliminate the interest costs associated with the borrowings however  selling a portion of our mbs portfolio to repay our debt will also reduce future cash flows we receive from repayments and prepayments on our securities because of the reduction in the total amount of our mbs portfolio 
prepayment risk we are also subject to prepayment risk 
prepayments are the full or partial repayment of unscheduled principal amounts and typically occur due to refinancing of that mortgage loan 
prepayment rates on mbs vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of adjustable rate and hybrid mbs generally increase when mortgage interest rates fall and generally decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such mortgages 
prepayments on adjustable rate mortgages may also increase in a rising rate environment as borrowers tend to move to fixed rate products 
prepayment experience also may be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions  seasonal changes and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying mbs 
the price we pay for mbs is partially determined by our expectations of the amounts and rates of prepayments 
if we expect fewer prepayments  we may pay a premium for the mbs we acquire 
if our assumptions are wrong and the actual amount of prepayments is greater than expected  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
in general  as prepayment speeds measured as the constant prepayment rate  or cpr on our mbs increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on mbs
