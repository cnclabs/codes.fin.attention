our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including as a result of some of the factors described below and in the section titled risk factors 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this form k 
overview we own  operate and manage treatment centers focused principally on providing radiation treatment alternatives ranging from conventional external beam radiation to newer  technologically advanced options 
we believe we are the largest company in the united states focused principally on providing radiation therapy 
we opened our first radiation treatment center in and as of december  we provided radiation therapy services in treatment centers 
our treatment centers are clustered into local markets in states  including alabama  arizona  california  delaware  florida  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  nevada  new jersey  new york  north carolina  rhode island  and west virginia 
of these treatment centers  treatment centers were internally developed  were acquired and involve hospital based treatment centers 
we have recently expanded our affiliation with physician specialties in other areas including gynecological and surgical oncology and urology in a limited number of our local markets to strengthen our clinical working relationships 
we use a number of metrics to assist management in evaluating financial condition and operating performance  and the most important follow the number of treatments delivered per day in our freestanding centers the average revenue per treatment in our freestanding centers the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio the principal costs of operating a treatment center are the salary and benefits of the physician and technical staff  and equipment and facility costs 
the capacity of each physician and technical position is limited to a number of delivered treatments while equipment and facility costs for a treatment center are generally fixed 
these capacity factors cause profitability to be very sensitive to treatment volume 
profitability will tend to increase as the available staff and equipment capacities are utilized 
the average revenue per treatment is sensitive to the mix of services used in treating a patient s tumor 
the reimbursement rates set by medicare and commercial payers tend to be higher for the more advanced treatment technologies  reflecting their higher complexity 
this metric is used by management to evaluate the utilization of newer technologies to improve outcomes for patients 
a key part of our business strategy is to implement advanced technologies once supporting economics are available 
for example  we implemented a pilot image guided radiation therapy program using kv x rays in one of our centers in and with expanded reimbursement for the technology available january   we will accelerate the implementation of this new technology across our local markets 
the reimbursement for radiation therapy services includes a professional component for the physician s service and a technical component to cover the costs of the machine  facility and services provided by the technical staff 
in our freestanding centers we provide both services while in a hospital based center the hospital  rather than us  provides the technical services 
fees that we receive from the hospital for services they purchase from us are included in other revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
net patient service revenue in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is derived from our freestanding centers and from the professional services provided by our doctors in hospital based centers and by our non radiation oncologists in their practice offices 

table of contents for the year ended december   our total revenues and net income pro forma net income grew by and  respectively  over the prior year 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million and net income of million 
our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to fluctuate 
many of the patients of our florida treatment centers are part time residents in florida during the winter months 
hence  these treatment centers have historically experienced higher utilization rates during the winter months than during the remainder of the year 
in addition  referrals are typically lower in the summer months due to traditional vacation periods 
the following table summarizes our growth in treatment centers and the local markets in which we operate year ended december  treatment centers at beginning of period internally developed internally consolidated acquired hospital based treatment centers at period end local markets at period end during the first quarter of  we incurred an impairment loss of million related to the consolidation of two yonkers  new york based treatment centers within our westchester bronx local market 
during the second quarter of  we incurred expenses of approximately million associated with the transition of an internally developed freestanding center to a hospital based radiation treatment center at northern westchester hospital within our westchester bronx local market 
the following table summarizes key operating statistics of our results of operations for the periods presented three months ended december  year ended december  change change number of treatment days total treatments freestanding centers treatments per day freestanding centers percentage change in revenue per treatment freestanding centers same practice basis percentage change in treatments per day freestanding centers same practice basis local markets at period end treatment centers freestanding treatment centers hospital days sales outstanding for the quarter percentage change in total revenues same practice basis our revenue growth is primarily driven by entering new markets  increasing the utilization at our existing centers and by benefiting from demographic and population trends in most of our local markets 
new centers are added to existing markets based on capacity  convenience  and competitive considerations 
our net income growth is primarily driven by revenue growth and the leveraging of our technical and administrative infrastructures 
for the year ended december   net patient service revenue comprised of our total revenues 
in a state where we can employ radiation oncologists  we derive our net patient service revenue through fees earned for the provision 
table of contents of the professional and technical component fee of radiation therapy services 
in states where we do not employ radiation oncologists  we derive our administrative services fees principally from administrative services agreements with professional corporations 
in of our radiation treatment centers we employ the physicians  and in we operate pursuant to administrative services agreements 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
r fin no 
r  we consolidate the operating results of certain of the professional corporations for which we provide administrative services into our own operating results 
in  of our net patient service revenue was generated by professional corporations with which we have administrative services agreements 
in states which prohibit us from employing physicians  we have long term administrative services agreements with professional corporations owned by certain of our directors  officers and principal shareholders  who are licensed to practice medicine in such states 
we have entered into these administrative services agreements in order to comply with the laws of such states  and in three states we operate our treatment centers as physician office practices 
our administrative services agreements generally obligate us to provide treatment center facilities  staff and equipment  accounting services  billing and collection services  management and administrative personnel  assistance in managed care contracting and assistance in marketing services 
we receive a monthly fixed fee for our services and the fees are set at the beginning of each year on the basis of the estimated cost of these services plus a profit margin 
we engaged an independent consultant to complete a fair market value review of the fees paid by related party professional service corporations to the company under the terms of these agreements 
the consulting firm completed a review of fees under these agreements and determined that the fees are at fair market value 
independent consultants are utilized by the company s audit committee in determining fair market fees upon any renewal or for new administrative services agreements with affiliates 
in our net patient service revenue for the years ended december  and  revenue from the professional only component of radiation therapy and revenue from the practices of medical specialties other than radiation oncology  comprised approximately and  respectively of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   other revenue comprised approximately of our total revenues 
other revenue is primarily derived from management services provided to hospital radiation therapy departments  technical services provided to hospital radiation therapy departments  billing services provided to non affiliated physicians and income for equipment leased by joint venture entities 
medicare is a major funding source for the services we provide and government reimbursement developments can have a material effect on operating performance 
these developments include the reimbursement amount for each cpt service current procedural terminology that we provide and the specific cpt services covered by medicare 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  the government agency responsible for administering the medicare program  administers an annual process for considering changes in reimbursement rates and covered services 
we have played and will continue to play a role in that process both directly and through the radiation oncology professional societies 
effective january   medicare began reimbursing hospital and hospital based facilities for kv x rays used in delivering image guided radiation therapy and this service will be reimbursed in the freestanding setting as of january  other material factors that we believe will also impact our future financial performance include continued advances in technology and the related capital requirements 
increased costs associated with being a new public company including compliance with sarbanes oxley section reporting on internal control 
increased costs associated with changes in the accounting for stock compensation 
proposed changes in accounting for business combinations requiring that all acquisition related costs be expensed as incurred 
acquisitions and developments we expect to continue to acquire and develop treatment centers in connection with the implementation of our growth strategy 
over the past three years  we have acquired treatment centers and internally developed treatment centers 
in  we acquired six treatment centers for total consideration of million  we opened two internally developed treatment centers and we signed agreements to provide services to three hospital based treatment centers 
of these treatment centers  six were located in four new local markets and five were located in existing markets 

table of contents on june  we acquired the assets of devoto construction  inc  which was owned by certain of our directors and officers for approximately  with the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
devoto construction  inc performs remodeling and real property improvements at our medical facilities and specializes in the construction of radiation medical facilities 
in  we acquired three treatment centers in the state of new jersey for a total consideration of million  and we opened three internally developed treatment centers 
one of these internally developed treatment centers replaced services we had previously provided through a hospital based center 
on april   we sold a interest in a joint venture that was formed to operate a treatment center located in berlin  maryland 
the interest was sold to a healthcare enterprise operating in the area for million 
we realized a gain of approximately  on the sale of the interest 
on april   we acquired a interest in a single radiation therapy treatment center located in martinsburg  west virginia for approximately million 
we will operate the facility as part of our western maryland local market 
under the terms of the agreement  we will partner with a university hospital system and manage the facility 
we are implementing an intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt program and other advanced technologies at the facility 
in may  we acquired five radiation treatment centers located in clark county  nevada from associated radiation oncologists  inc for million  plus a three year contingent earn out 
we plan to expand the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in the service area 
this acquisition expanded our presence in nevada where we operated four centers before the acquisition 
in june  we acquired four radiation treatment centers located in the markets of scottsdale  arizona  holyoke  massachusetts  and two centers in maryland for approximately million 
this acquisition provided our first entrance into two new local markets in arizona and massachusetts 
the two centers purchased in maryland will further expand our presence in our western maryland local market 
we plan to expand the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in the service areas 
during the second quarter of we were awarded a contract to develop a state of the art radiation center at the prestigious roger williams hospital in providence  rhode island 
as of june  we were providing professional services  and we are planning for a joint venture freestanding radiation therapy center with the hospital 
in september  we opened for business our south county  rhode island treatment center and began treating patients at the facility 
the center is our third center opened in our rhode island local market 
in november  we opened for business our palm springs  california treatment center and began treating patients at the facility 
the center is our th treatment center in operation and our entrance into our nd local market 
in december  the company acquired the assets of a urology practice with four office locations in southwest florida for approximately  the urology practice provides additional service and treatment protocols to our patients with prostate cancer and other urological diseases 
the operations of the foregoing acquisitions have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from the respective dates of each acquisition 
when we acquire a treatment center  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
in october  we announced that we will install seven stereotactic radiosurgery systems with image guided radiation therapy igrt capabilities at treatment centers in four of our southwest florida local markets and our las vegas  nevada local market 
the installation of the systems will be completed as a pilot program  giving us the opportunity to utilize new technologies and develop protocols for future technology integration 
the aggregate cost of the systems is million and will be funded by our cash from operations and our lease and revolving lines of credit 
the stereotactic systems will allow us to treat extra cranial cancers to a higher dose with target localization and image verification 
all of the systems include image guided radiation therapy igrt capabilities using both cone beam computed tomography ct and high quality kv x ray imaging 

table of contents the systems are capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery by increasing the maximum dose delivery rate and by fine tuning the focal point of the beams to a one millimeter diameter sphere 
additionally  the focal point is moveable by remote control  which speeds treatment time while maximizing the number of beam angles that can be used to optimize delivery in a single treatment 
the systems can also be used for stereotactic radiotherapy  which is delivered over several days  and intensity modulated  conventional and conformal radiation therapy  which is delivered in small daily doses over a period of weeks 
while the company s operations at of its treatment centers in south florida were recently disrupted by hurricane wilma  the centers did not suffer any structural damage because of the hurricane 
the centers were closed on monday  october  in anticipation of the hurricane and all of the centers were fully operational by the end of october as electrical power was restored 
the company s fourth quarter financial results were affected by the hurricane 
in january we acquired the assets of a radiation treatment center located in opp  alabama for approximately million 
the center purchased in alabama will further expand our presence in its southeastern alabama local market 
we plan to expand the availability of advanced radiation therapy treatment modalities in this service area 
sources of revenue by payor we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the government medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  managed care organizations and our patients directly 
generally  our revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net patient service revenue we earned by category of payor in our last three fiscal years 
years ended december  payor medicare and medicaid commercial self pay total net patient service revenue medicare and medicaid since cancer disproportionately affects elderly people  a significant portion of our net patient service revenue is derived from the medicare program as well as related co payments 
medicare reimbursement rates are determined by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and are lower than our normal charges 
medicaid reimbursement rates are typically lower than medicare rates  medicaid payments represent less than of our net patient service revenue 
medicare reimbursement rates are determined by a formula which takes into account an industry wide conversion factor cf multiplied by relative values determined on a per procedure basis rvus 
the cf and rvus may change on an annual basis 
in  the cf increased by  in  it increased by  and in  the rate increased an additional and in the cf will not change from the level 
the net result of changes to the cf and rvus of the changes over the last several years has not had a significant impact on our business  but it is difficult to forecast the future impact of any changes 
we depend on payments from government sources and any changes in medicare or medicaid programs could result in a decrease in our total revenues and net income 
commercial commercial sources include private health insurance as well as related payments for co insurance and co payments 
we enter into contracts with private health insurance and other health benefit groups by granting discounts to such organizations in return for the patient volume they provide 
most of our commercial revenue is from managed care business and is attributable to contracts where a set fee is negotiated relative to services provided by our treatment centers 
we do not have any contracts that individually represent over of our total net patient service revenue 
we receive our managed care contracted revenue under two primary 
table of contents arrangements 
approximately of our managed care business is attributable to contracts where a fee schedule is negotiated for services provided at our treatment centers 
approximately of our net patient service revenue is attributable to contracts where we bear utilization risk 
although the terms and conditions of our managed care contracts vary considerably  they are typically for a one year term and provide for automatic renewals 
if payments by managed care organizations and other private third party payors decrease  then our total revenues and net income could decrease 
self pay self pay consists of payments for treatments by patients not otherwise covered by third party payors  such as government or commercial sources 
because the incidence of cancer is much higher in those over the age of  most of our patients have access to medicare or other insurance and therefore the self pay portion of our business is not significant 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s subjective or complex judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation 
financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
r fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities if the company is the primary beneficiary of the activities of those entities 
certain of our radiation oncology practices are variable interest entities as defined by fin no 
r  and we have a variable interest in each of these practices through our administrative services agreements 
through our variable interests in these practices  we would absorb a majority of the net losses of these practices  should they occur 
based on these determinations  we have included the radiation oncology practices in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
all of our significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
net patient service revenue and allowances for contractual discounts 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide us payments at amounts different from our established rates 
net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered 
net patient service revenue is recognized as services are provided 
medicare and other governmental programs reimburse physicians based on fee schedules  which are determined by the related government agency 
we also have agreements with managed care organizations to provide physician services based on negotiated fee schedules 
accordingly  the revenues reported in our consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount that is expected to be received 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from medicare  medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from our standard charges 
we must estimate the total amount of these discounts to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
the medicare and medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex and subject to interpretation and adjustment 
the development of the estimate of contractual allowances is based on historical cash collections related to gross charges developed by facility and payor in order to calculate average collection percentages by facility and payor 
the development of the collection percentages are applied to gross accounts receivable in determining an estimate of contractual allowances at the end of a reporting period 
the estimate for contractual allowances is also based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
these interpretations sometimes result in payments that differ from our original estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently  necessitating regular review and reassessment of the estimation process 
changes in estimates related to the allowance for contractual discounts affect revenues reported in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

table of contents during  and  approximately   and  respectively  of net patient service revenue related to services rendered under the medicare and medicaid programs 
in the ordinary course of business  we are potentially subject to a review by regulatory agencies concerning the accuracy of billings and sufficiency of supporting documentation of procedures performed 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
accounts receivable and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
accounts receivable are reported net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts and contractual adjustments 
accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reduce the carrying amount of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the credit risk for other concentrations other than medicare of receivables is limited due to the large number of insurance companies and other payors that provide payments for our services 
we do not believe that there are any other significant concentrations of receivables from any particular payor that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our accounts receivables 
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage and other collection indicators 
the primary tool used in our assessment is an annual  detailed review of historical collections and write offs of accounts receivable 
the results of our detailed review of historical collections and write offs  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions  are used to evaluate the allowance amount for the current period 
accounts receivable are written off after collection efforts have been followed in accordance with our policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net assets we have acquired in business combinations 
on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill had been amortized on a straight line basis over years through december  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  we completed our transitional impairment test under sfas no 
as of january   based on projected cash flows of the business 
due to an increase in competition and the presence of capitation arrangements with third party payors  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected for certain locations 
based on the earnings forecast for these markets  a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized 
the impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  subsequent impairment losses  if any  will be reflected in income before minority interests 
for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss of  due to increased competition related to a specific treatment center within one of our local markets 
no goodwill impairment was recognized for the years ended december  and intangible assets consist of noncompete agreements and licenses and are amortized over the life of the agreements which typically range from to years using the straight line method 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
assessment of possible impairment of a particular asset is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of such asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for the write down to fair value of certain of our analog linear accelerators and treatment simulators 
the adjustment to machine inventories was precipitated by the decision to discontinue the installation of this type of equipment in favor of digital machines with migration capability and combination ct simulators 
this amount is included in general and administrative expenses in the statement of income and comprehensive income for the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we incurred an impairment loss of million related to the consolidation of two yonkers  new york based treatment centers within our westchester bronx local market 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  
table of contents recognize no compensation expense for the stock option grants to employees provided that the exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the values of options issued to non employees have been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods and services  and are periodically remeasured as the services are performed and recognize the expense ratably over the service period 
on november   our board of directors  upon the recommendation of our compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors  approved the acceleration of vesting of all nonqualified outstanding nonvested stock options previously granted under our equity compensation plans 
as a result of the acceleration of the nonqualified nonvested stock options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock  which would otherwise have vested over periods of two to four years  will become immediately exercisable 
the affected stock options have an exercise price of per share 
the primary purpose of the acceleration of the nonqualified nonvested stock options is to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these stock options in future periods in our statement of income and comprehensive income  upon adoption of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of income and comprehensive income  rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
r the compensation expense associated with these accelerated options that would have been recognized in our statement of income and comprehensive income commencing with the implementation of sfas r and continuing through is approximately million 
income taxes we make estimates in recording our provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these benefits  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset

we believe available borrowings under our current credit facility and lease lines  together with our cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
after such time period  to the extent available borrowings and cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund future requirements  we will need to seek additional financing through additional increases in our credit facility  negotiate credit facilities with other lenders or institutions or seek additional capital through private placements or public offerings of equity or debt securities

table of contents reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our treatment centers or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
inflation while inflation was not a material factor in either revenue or operating expenses during the periods presented  the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and labor shortages  such as the nationwide shortage of dosimetrists and radiation therapists 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have to date offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement or expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases

in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
seasonality our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to fluctuate 
many of the patients of our florida treatment centers are part time residents in florida during the winter months 
hence  these treatment centers have historically experienced higher utilization rates during the winter months than during the remainder of the year 
in addition  referrals are typically lower in the summer months due to traditional vacation periods
