item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are in item of this document 
business general we directly or through contractors  design  manufacture  sell  and service information technology and surveillance technology products through two major business segments 
these two business segments are the transportation communications segment and the law enforcement and surveillance segment 
while service is a significant aspect of dri s marketing strategy  it is not yet a significant generator of revenue and was less than percent of net sales for the years ended december    and dri s transportation communications segment products are sold worldwide within the passenger information communication industry and market 
we sell to transportation vehicle equipment customers generally in two broad categories  end customers and original equipment manufacturers of transportation vehicles 
end customers include municipalities  regional transportation districts  federal  state  and local departments of transportation  transit agencies  public  private  or commercial operators of vehicles  and rental car agencies 
the relative percentage of sales to end customers as compared to oem customers varies widely 
table of contents and frequently from quarter to quarter and year to year and within products and product lines comprising dri s mix of total sales in any given period 
dri s law enforcement and surveillance segment serves customers in the us federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies or organizations  as well as their counterparts abroad 
we produce a line of digital audio filter systems and tape transcribers used to improve the quality and intelligibility of both live and recorded voices 
we market dri s law enforcement and surveillance products domestically and internationally to law enforcement entities and other customers in or supporting government organizations 
sales to dri s customers are characterized by a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends for a period of two to months 
in addition  purchases by a majority of dri s customers are dependent upon federal  state and local funding that may vary from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we recognize product sales upon shipment of products to customers and service revenue upon completion of the service 
because dri s operations are characterized by significant research and development expenses preceding product introduction  net sales and certain related expenses may not be recorded in the same period  thereby producing fluctuations in operating results 
dri s dependence upon large contracts and orders  as well as upon a small number of relatively large customers or projects  increases the magnitude of fluctuations in operating results particularly on a period to period  or period over period  comparison basis 
for a more complete description of dri s business  including a description of dri s products  sales cycle and research and development  see item business 
results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of dri s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
this should be read in conjunction with dri s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the operating results of the years presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
the following table sets forth the percentage of dri s sales represented by certain items included in dri s statements of operations year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating loss other expense  foreign currency gain loss and interest loss before income tax expense income tax expense loss before minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net loss comparison of results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit 
our net sales for  decreased million or percent  from million for  to million for dri s gross profit for decreased million  or 
table of contents percent  from million for to million for following is a discussion of these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
transportation communications segment 
due to commonality of customers  sales channels  products  technology  internal support groups  industry funding  and management  we manage and report our us and foreign transportation communications business as a single reporting segment 
for discussion purposes  we differentiate between sales and gross profit for the us market and the foreign markets to better provide our investors with useful information 
for  sales of our transportation communications segment decreased million  or percent  from million for to million for the decrease resulted from lower us domestic sales of million  offset by higher sales of million from our foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in international sales is attributed to higher sales in the south american and asian pacific markets  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for compared to  partially offset by lower sales in the european market 
the increase in net sales due to foreign currency fluctuations for was approximately thousand 
dri does not use currency hedging tools 
each of our foreign subsidiaries primarily conducts business in its respective functional currencies thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency transaction differences 
if the us dollar strengthens compared to the foreign currencies converted  it is possible the total sales reported in us dollars could decline 
expected sales growth in the transportation communications segment will be dependent upon the expansion of new product offerings and technology  as well as expansion into new geographic areas 
we believe our relatively high market share positions in some markets preclude significant sales growth from increased market share 
the decrease in us domestic sales includes a decline of approximately million in oem and spare parts sales  a decline of thousand in programming services substantially due to a one time programming effort during  partially offset by a thousand increase in our repair  service  training revenues  and sales returns and allowances 
lower sales volume and prices of various product lines  continued pricing pressures from customers  a change in product mix  an overall market decline in transportation vehicle production  the closure of two vehicle manufacturers  and declining spare parts sales led to the lower us domestic sales 
repair and service sales increased in  primarily due to sales to three customers  however  these type of sales tend to fluctuate greatly from period to period 
our transportation communications segment gross profit decreased million  or percent  from million in to million in as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent in of the million net decrease in gross profit  a million decrease was attributable to us operations and offset by a million increase attributable to international operations 
the international gross profit as a percentage of sales for was percent as compared to percent for the increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to favorable customer and product mix  and cost reduction strategies on materials costs within the european  south american and asian pacific markets 
the us gross profit percentage of sales for  was percent as compared to percent for beginning in but with a full year impact in  our us domestic companies began in house production of sub assemblies such as cabling  wiring harnesses  and brackets 
as in house production has increased  incremental direct costs such as production and service related salaries  along with related overhead costs  and depreciation on production equipment have been included in cost of sales 
in order to manage headcount  the company has re assigned some people previously in selling  general  and administrative roles to more production and service related responsibilities 
these additional production related costs have contributed to the decrease in the us gross margins 
the company s long term goal is to be better able to manage production costs by having selected operations in house  rather than solely relying on third party manufacturers 

table of contents in  the u 
s domestic companies recorded a million inventory obsolescence charge as compared to thousand in a significant portion of funding for capital purchases in our industry is provided by the us federal government see discussion of the transportation equity act for the st century tea in the section entitled industry and market overview in part i  item  business 
as such  the company is required by federal procurement statutes to maintain replacement parts for our products for the life of the transportation vehicle  generally ranging from to years 
until the timeframe  standard technology within our electronic signs business of our consolidated revenues relied upon an electro mechanical product known as flip dot whereby a small electrical charge would cause a small plastic circular shaped dot to physically flip over showing a brightly colored light reflecting side rather than a black matt finished side 
the electro mechanical plastic component was subject to a less than predictable failure rate 
as such  participants in our industry maintained a comparatively large inventory of replacement parts and those parts did not diminish in value except over unusually long periods years 
in fact  there were instances wherein the parts could be sold at prices higher than their historical levels as the signs approached the end of their life cycles and replacement parts became harder to obtain 
maintaining a larger inventory of replacement parts than might be seen in other industries causes comparatively low inventory turnover within our industry 
beginning in  the standard technology within our signs business changed from flip dot to light emitting diode led  a highly stable  highly reliable semiconductor product with great visibility and  in hindsight  great durability 
however  being new and unproven technology within our industry and mounted on the front of a city bus exposed to changing weather conditions  extreme light conditions  and harsh vibration  replacement parts were maintained at historical levels until the technology had proven itself to be reliable 
during  and continuing into  following two years of experience with the new technology and experiencing extremely low failure rates as compared to the flip dot product  a determination was made that maintaining such a large inventory of replacement parts was not necessary  and that a diminution of value for the replacement parts inventory had occurred 
as such  the inventory was permanently written down to its estimated net realizable value in accordance with gaap 
of the million and thousand write downs in and  respectively  million and thousand in and  respectively  were within our us electronic signs business with the remainder being other miscellaneous write downs 
though we may experience continued pricing pressure  we expect our gross margins within our individual product lines to stabilize in the near term as we continue to recognize cost savings resulting from recent and planned future cost reduction efforts 
however  period to period  overall gross margins will still reflect the variations in sales mix and geographical dispersion of product sales 
we expect increased in house production of cabling  wire harnesses  and brackets to contribute to overall costs savings  allow better delivery times for our customers  and allow us to produce in quantities that are more efficient 
we also expect improvements in gross margins through more frequent sales of a combination of products and services offering a broader project solution  and through the introduction of technology improvements 
law enforcement and surveillance segment 
sales for our law enforcement and surveillance segment increased thousand or percent  from million for  to million for the increased sales in is related to sales of new technology in the fourth quarter  predominately to the us federal government 
the segment gross profit for  decreased thousand  or percent  from million for  to thousand for as a percentage of segment sales  our gross profit was percent of our net segment sales for  as compared to percent during as with our transportation communication segment discussed above  in we began incurring incremental direct costs along with related overhead costs as cost of sales 
the decrease in the gross profit is related to a thousand write off of obsolete and slow moving inventory in as compared to a write off of thousand in  increased oem material costs  increased depreciation on capitalized software  a large shipment in the first quarter of at a lower than usual gross profit due to a high third party content of personal computers  and higher material costs on the third and fourth quarter sales related to the new technology 
we believe improvement in our gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of our on going cost reduction programs 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for the majority of this increase was a result of net increases in outside service fees of thousand related to our compliance efforts in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of  increased compensation and benefits of million  including general increases and additional personnel in support of administration and engineering functions and an increase in foreign personnel  increased employee recruiting and training costs of thousand  increased travel related expenses of thousand  and increased bad debt expense of thousand 
additional significant expenses included the tri annual apta trade show and increased depreciation expense from recent capital asset purchases 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in public company costs of approximately thousand  including printing fees  audit fees  and legal fees 
as a percentage of our net sales  these expenses were percent in and percent in the increase is due to the higher general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
management believes  that as sales increase  these expenses will decrease as a percentage of sales 
however  in terms of absolute dollars  selling  general  and administrative expenses are planned to increase in future periods due to expansion into other geographic areas  expansion through acquisition  introduction of new products and services  and compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for decreased thousand  or percent  from million for to million for this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel  outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  and new product development 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from percent in to percent in during  as in prior years  certain engineering personnel were used in the development of software that met the capitalization criteria of sfas no 
 capitalization of software development costs  which resulted in recording approximately million of costs as an asset that will be amortized as the sales of the software are realized over a period no longer than three years 
research and development expenses  including those costs that were capitalized  were million for  as compared to million for in the longer term  we expect these expenses expressed as a percentage of sales to range from approximately to percent of net sales 
operating loss 
the net change in our operating loss was an increase of million from million in to million in this decrease is primarily due to lower sales and higher cost of sales in the transportation communications segment  higher operating  personnel costs  bad debt  and depreciation costs as described above  partially offset by the increased sales in our law enforcement and surveillance segment 
other income  foreign currency gain loss  and interest expense 
other income  foreign currency gain loss  and interest expense decreased thousand from thousand in  to thousand in  due to a decrease in interest expense of thousand  offset by an increase in foreign currency loss of thousand  and an increase in other income of thousand 
the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to decreases in the amount of borrowings on our credit facilities and in the amount of outstanding long term debt 
the decrease in outstanding debt was a result of two separate private placements of common stock in of million each  and two private placements of preferred stock in totaling million 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was thousand in as compared with an income tax expense of thousand in the tax expense for consisted of thousand arising from united states state jurisdictions and thousand arising from foreign jurisdictions 
net loss applicable to common shareholders 
the net loss applicable to common shareholders increased million from a net loss of million in to a net loss of million in this increase in net loss is due to the factors previously addressed  as well as thousand non cash charges related to preferred stock offerings 
comparison of results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit 
net sales for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for dri s gross profit for increased million  or percent  from 
table of contents million for to million for following is a discussion of the key factors affecting these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
in  the company recorded revenues associated with a software license agreement of million  as compared to thousand in without the software license revenues and related gross profit  net sales would have increased from and our gross profit would have increased from for  sales for our transportation communications segment increased million  or percent  from million for to million for the increase resulted from an increase in us domestic sales of million plus an increase in international sales of million 
in the us  the increase is primarily attributable to higher integrated systems sales  partially offset by lower sales in electronic sign systems 
the increase in international sales is attributed to higher sales in the nordic and brazilian markets and more favorable average foreign currency exchange rates in compared to the increase in net sales due to foreign currency fluctuations in was approximately million 
dri has no control over the foreign currency fluctuations and does not use currency hedging tools 
the respective foreign companies primarily transact business in their functional currency thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency translation differences 
if the us dollar strengthens compared to the foreign currencies converted  it is possible the total sales reported in us dollars could decline 
product prices on sales of products have declined in as compared to  primarily due to competition 
gross profit for the transportation communications segment increased thousand  or percent  from million in to million in however  in  the company recorded a million inventory obsolescence charge  as compared to a thousand inventory obsolescence charge in the increase in inventory obsolescence from thousand to million from to  resulted in a reduction of the increase in gross profit for the transportation communications segment  as compared to  from percent to percent 
as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent in of the net increase in gross profit  thousand was attributed to us operations and thousand was attributed to the international operations 
domestic gross margins improved primarily due to product cost savings in despite continued pricing pressures 
as a percent of sales  us operations increased average gross margins from percent in to percent in  which was primarily attributed to decreases in the cost of key components in the electronic destination sign systems 
the consolidated international operations realized average gross margins of percent in and percent in the decrease in gross margins is attributed to product mix and the introduction in of the lower priced all led electronic destination sign systems in the european markets 
for  sales for the law enforcement and surveillance segment increased thousand or percent  from million for to million for the increase is attributed to the reallocation of federal and state funds to support post security issues 
gross profit for the law enforcement and surveillance segment for increased thousand  or percent  from thousand for to million for however  the company recorded a thousand inventory obsolescence charge in compared to no such charge in the inventory obsolescence charge resulted in a reduction of the gross profit for the law enforcement and surveillance segment from an increase over of percent to percent 
as a percentage of segment sales  gross profit was percent of net segment sales in as compared to percent  percent excluding the inventory obsolescence charge during lower sales in versus to the us federal government and from a special research project for a foreign government  which yield higher gross margins  contributed to the decline in gross margins 
management believes improvement in gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of on going cost reduction programs 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for increased million  or percent  from million for to million for the majority of this increase was comprised of the increased compensation and benefits of thousand  or percent over 
table of contents  an increase in legal expense of thousand stemming from defense costs relative to a patent infringement case settled in june  and the costs incurred in connection with series e  series f  and common stock financings 
the company also experienced an increase in audit and tax services professional fees of thousand stemming from the financings and a change in independent accountants  an increase in public company costs including board of directors costs resulting from a greater number of committee meetings and financial communications printing costs of thousand  and an increase in outside consulting costs including it services of thousand 
all other general operating and administrative expenses increased by thousand 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were percent in and percent for the increase also includes foreign currency fluctuations  but the overall increase is attributed to additional personnel added during the year to support the additional requirements of reporting and management  an increase in average health care benefits and taxes  higher legal expenses in patent litigation  higher audit and tax services due to changes in regulations  particularly the sarbanes oxley act of  higher depreciation from increases in capital asset purchase  capitalization of internal developed systems and software  and general inflation in the prices of goods and services 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for decreased thousand  or percent  from million for to million for this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel  outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  sustaining product engineering  and new product development 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from percent in to percent in during  certain engineering personnel were used in the development of software that met the capitalization criteria of sfas no 
 capitalization of software development costs  which resulted in recording approximately million of costs as an asset that will be amortized as the sales of the software are realized over a period no longer than three years 
research and development expenses for  including those costs that were capitalized  were million as compared to million for operating loss 
operating loss increased million from thousand in to million in the increase is primarily due to higher operating expenses and personnel costs  and the inventory obsolescence adjustment 
these factors were partially offset by the increased sales in both operating segments  all as described above 
other income  foreign currency gain  and interest expense 
other income  foreign currency gain  and interest expense decreased thousand from thousand in  to thousand in  due to a decrease in interest expense of thousand  offset by a decrease in foreign currency loss of thousand  and an increase in other income of thousand 
the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to approximately million of convertible debentures with an annual interest rate of percent were converted into common stock  as well as  the completion of two separate private placements of common shares totaling million each in april and october  the proceeds of which were used primarily to reduce debt and the working capital line of credit 
income tax expense 
income tax expense  consisting primarily of net deferred tax expense  was thousand in as compared with an income tax expense of thousand in in  the most significant component of income tax expense was an thousand increase in the tax valuation allowance expense arising primarily from united states federal and state jurisdictions 
the company determined in that a significant portion of the deferred income tax assets previously recorded through  would more likely than not  not be realizable 

table of contents net loss applicable to common shareholders 
the net loss applicable to common shareholders increased million from a net loss of million in to a net loss of million in the increased loss is primarily the result of the changes in net operating loss previously discussed  the income tax expense resulting from the valuation allowance  offset by the lack of a charge in comparable to the non cash beneficial conversion charge of thousand on the issuance of series f convertible preferred stock in cash flows the company s net working capital as of december   was million compared to million as of december  our principal sources of liquidity from current assets included cash and cash equivalents of thousand  trade and other receivables of million and inventories of million 
the company continues to decrease the average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and expects to increase inventory turns through better materials requirement planning  reworking what otherwise might be considered slow moving inventory and negotiating lower component prices through volume purchase programs 
the most significant current liabilities at december   included short term bank and asset based borrowings of million  accounts payable of million  accrued expenses of million  and current maturities of long term debt of million 
the short term bank borrowings  both foreign and domestic  are primarily asset based lending agreements and directly related to the sales and customer account collections and inventory 
such borrowings are classified as a current liability rather than a long term liability and were negotiated with the intent that the revolving debt would be classified and managed as long term debt  however  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement  requires the company to classify all of our outstanding debt under the bank facility as a current liability 
the loan agreement has a subjective acceleration clause  which could enable the bank to call the loan  but such language is customary in asset based lending agreements and management does not expect the bank to use this particular clause to inhibit the company from making borrowings as provided under the agreement 
our operating activities provided cash of thousand for the year ended december  sources of cash from operations totaled million and resulted from a decrease in trade accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other receivables of thousand  a decrease in other assets of thousand  an increase of trade accounts payable of million  an increase of accrued expenses of thousand  and our net loss of million offset by non cash expenses of million 
non cash expenses included million related to the write down of obsolete inventory to its net realizable value 
all other non cash expenses were of normal  routine amounts associated with operations 
cash used in operating activities totaled thousand and primarily resulted from increases in inventories of thousand and prepaids and other current assets of thousand 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable results from a percent decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter in  supplemented by increased collections on trade accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of due to more aggressive collection efforts by the company 
the increase in inventories stemmed primarily from our domestic operations and resulted from a build up of inventory components during the year while realizing lower than anticipated sales 
the increase in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses is a direct result of the company lengthening payment cycles during the last quarter of to more closely match the timing of collections from customers in its efforts to better manage working capital 
we consider the changes incurred in our operating assets and liabilities routine  given the number and size of orders relative to our industry and our size 
we expect working capital requirements to continue to increase with growth in sales  primarily due to the timing between when we must pay suppliers and the time we receive payment from our customers 
our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  the primary uses of cash were for purchases of computer  test  and office equipment  and costs incurred for internally developed software 
cash flows from investing activities resulted from a small number of routine sales of individual pieces of equipment no longer used or that had been replaced 
we do not anticipate any significant expenditures for  or sales of  capital equipment in the near future 

table of contents our financing activities generated net cash of million 
sources of cash resulted from issuance of common and preferred stock of million  net of issuance costs 
net proceeds from issuance of common stock resulted from the exercise of options and were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of million resulted from the sale of our series g preferred stock 
proceeds from series g preferred sales were used to pay the outstanding principal balance and all accrued interest on the unsecured note to the former owner of mobitec ab in the amount of million 
the remaining proceeds from sales of series g preferred were used for general corporate and working capital purposes 
uses of cash in financing activities were for the payment of dividends on our series aaa and series e preferred stock of thousand and the net of borrowings and payments on our revolving lines of credit of thousand 
financing activities in on february   shareholders of the company s privately held series aaa preferred stock approved two changes to its series aaa articles of incorporation at a special meeting of such shareholders

holders of the series g preferred are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends payable in additional shares of series g preferred at a rate of percent per annum on the liquidation value of thousand per share  subject to certain upward adjustments  and increasing by an additional percent annum after five years 
in conjunction with the sale of series g preferred  the company also granted those investors  including mr 
higgins  a director of the company  warrants to acquire  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  exercisable for a period of five years 
the fair value allocated to the warrants of thousand  calculated using the black scholes model  has been treated as a discount to the series g preferred and was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
the issuance of the warrants resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of the series g preferred valued at thousand 

table of contents on july   the company issued an unsecured subordinated promissory note for thousand to mr 
john higgins  a director of the company 
the note bears interest at a rate of per annum  paid on the last day of each month  and is due and payable  along with any unpaid interest  one year from the date of the note

total proceeds to the company were thousand  all of which were used for general corporate and working capital purposes 
in october  a former employee exercised options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at exercise prices of for  shares and for  shares 
total proceeds to the company were thousand  all of which will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes 
liquidity and capital resources based upon fourth quarter and full year results in  dri did not meet its financial covenants under the company s working capital line of credit with lasalle and another subordinated debt  however  such covenants were waived at december  the waiver for non compliance of covenants in the lasalle credit agreement was received in the form of a waiver  consent and fourth amendment agreement dated march  the fourth amendment 
on march   the company entered into a two year asset based lending agreement with laurus master fund laurus credit agreement to replace the lasalle credit agreement 
the laurus credit agreement provides up to million in borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the laurus credit agreement were used to repay all outstanding debt under the lasalle credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 
the new credit facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the company in the us and canada 
borrowing availability under the laurus credit agreement is based upon an advance rate equal to of eligible accounts receivable and up to million based upon of eligible inventory 
the interest rate on borrowings under the laurus credit agreement is the wall street journal prime rate plus  subject to a floor of 
the laurus credit agreement contains no financial covenants 
in conjunction with the closing of the laurus credit agreement  the company issued laurus warrants to purchase  at any time   shares of common stock at per share 
the issuance of the warrants is subject to a holding rights agreement under which laurus will not hold greater than of the company s outstanding common stock at any time 
the company is required to file a registration statement with the sec for the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued to laurus within days of funding and is required to have the registration declared effective within days of funding

upon issuance of the series i preferred  the cash advance received by the company in december  and held in the trust account of the company s outside legal counsel  was released to the company 
the funds  net of financing fees  will be used 
table of contents for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the sale of the series i preferred  the company issued to the investor warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants will be exercisable at any time for a period of five years after issuance 
the issuance of the series i preferred stock caused the conversion rate on the thousand convertible subordinated debenture  held by john higgins  a director of the company  to change from per share to per share  resulting in a potential increase of  additional shares of common stock 
management conclusion we have incurred substantial losses to date  and  as of december   have an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to require additional funding in the foreseeable future to support operations 
the new credit agreement with laurus provided an immediate increase in borrowing availability of approximately million  and proceeds from the issuance of series i preferred were  both net of fees and expenses 
both amounts were used to pay routine accounts payable 
despite these recent financings  we expect to manage carefully our liquidity going forward 
while our on going profit improvement efforts are impacting results  in addition to tightly controlling costs  we will be required to carefully manage inventory and receivables to maximize liquidity 
operating results and cash flows of the us operating companies are improving and those improvements are expected to continue 
however  such expectations rely upon projections based upon assumptions and forecasts  including factors beyond our control 
actual results could vary from our projections and such variance could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity 
we believe the cash flows of our us operating companies alone may not be sufficient to fund the us operations for the remainder of historically  we have supplementally financed operations through private placements of our securities 
we may raise up to an additional million of equity 
however  there can be no assurances that such placements will occur or be possible in the future 
if further financings are not available  we would likely be unable to continue our operations without significantly curtailing our activities  if at all 
these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
although we have  in the past  had to advance cash to our non us operating companies  those companies are currently generating adequate cash flows to meet their working capital needs 
we do not  however  anticipate non us operating companies will produce cash flows sufficient to return all  or even a portion  of those advances in the near future 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of thousand and a working capital surplus of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates dri s significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following is a listing of dri s critical accounting policies and estimates and a brief description of each allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  including deferred tax assets  and revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts relates to trade accounts receivable 
it reflects our estimate of the amount of our outstanding accounts receivable that are not likely to be collected 
most of our company s sales are to large oem equipment manufacturers or to state or local governmental units or authorities  so management expects low losses from true collectibility problems 
table of contents resulting from insolvency or actual inability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is a periodic estimate prepared by management based upon identification of the collections of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our trade receivables  the customer relationships underlying the receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
inventory valuation and warranty reserve 
we periodically evaluate the carrying amount of inventory based upon current shipping forecasts and warranty and post warranty component requirements
