part i item business general description of business we are a global supplier of advanced technology products and systems to a wide range of industries  including scientific research  microelectronics manufacturing  aerospace and defense security  life and health sciences  industrial manufacturing and communications 
in july  we acquired spectra physics  inc and certain related entities collectively  spectra physics 
spectra physics manufactures solid state  gas and dye lasers  high power diode lasers  and ultrafast laser systems  as well as photonics instruments and components  including light sources  monochromators  spectroscopy instrumentation  optical filters  ruled and holographic diffraction gratings and crystals 
at the time of the acquisition  we established spectra physics laser and laser related technology business as our new lasers division  and we combined spectra physics photonics businesses with the existing businesses that comprised our former industrial and scientific technologies division to create our new photonics and precision technologies division 
following the acquisition of spectra physics  we conducted a strategic review of all of our businesses and concluded that our robotic systems operations in richmond  california  which serve the front end semiconductor equipment industry with product lines including wafer handling robots  load ports and equipment front end modules  were no longer core to our overall strategy 
consequently  in the first quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to sell these operations 
at that time  we classified our robotic systems operations as discontinued operations 
we completed the sale of these operations in december the robotic systems operations represented a substantial portion of our former advanced packaging and automation systems apas division 
as a result of our decision to divest these operations  we realigned our business segments to include all remaining operations of our former apas division within our photonics and precision technologies division 
accordingly  our operations are now conducted through two divisions  our lasers division and our photonics and precision technologies division 
through our lasers division and our photonics and precision technologies division  we provide a broad product portfolio to our targeted customer end markets scientific research  aerospace and defense security  microelectronics which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment and computer peripherals customers  life and health sciences  and all other end markets which include general industrial and communications customers 
this extensive portfolio enables us to offer our customers an end to end resource for products that make  manage and measure light 
we provide solid state  gas and dye lasers  high power diode lasers  ultrafast laser systems and laser technology used in a wide array of applications  including scientific research  industrial and microelectronics manufacturing and life and health sciences  components and integrated subsystems to manufacturers of semiconductor processing equipment  biomedical instrumentation and medical devices  advanced automated assembly systems to manufacturers of communications and electronics devices  and a broad array of high precision systems  components and instruments to commercial  academic and government customers worldwide 
our products leverage our expertise in laser technology  photonics instrumentation  precision automation  sub micron positioning systems  vibration isolation and optical subsystems  and are designed to enhance the capabilities and productivity of our customers manufacturing  engineering and research applications 
we have established a business team  comprised of technical and operations specialists  which is charged with designing  developing and manufacturing systems and subsystems that integrate our broad portfolio of products and technologies into solutions that meet the specific applications requirements of our original equipment manufacturer oem and selected end user customers 
with our expertise in the design  development and manufacture of these integrated solutions  we help our customers accelerate the time to market and enhance the performance of their equipment or instrumentation products 
for nearly four decades we have serviced the needs of research laboratories for precision equipment 
since  we have acquired a number of companies to expand our product offerings  technology base and geographic presence 
through these acquisitions and our internal development efforts  we have evolved from a provider of discrete components and instruments for research applications to a company that manufactures both components and integrated systems for research and commercial applications 
during  we acquired micro robotics systems  inc mrsi  a manufacturer of high precision  fully automated assembly and dispensing systems for back end packaging applications in the semiconductor  microwave communications and fiber optic communications markets 
our acquisition of spectra physics in significantly increased the scope of our expertise and product offerings in our target customer end markets  and approximately doubled our size with respect to revenue  number of employees and facilities 
we will continue to pursue acquisitions of companies  technologies and complementary product lines that we believe will provide us with key technologies  give us access to new markets or otherwise further our strategic objectives 
conversely  from time to time  we review our different businesses  including our acquired companies  to ensure that they are key to our strategic plans  and close or divest businesses that we determine are no longer of strategic importance

these systems and subsystems are a value added combination of our engineering expertise  together with standard and custom products drawn from the entire spectrum of our lasers  photonics instrumentation  optics  opto mechanical  precision micro positioning and vibration isolation product lines 
we have established a business team  comprised of technical and operations specialists  which collaborates across our divisions to provide these integrated solutions to our customers 
we believe that our capability to develop these integrated solutions gives us a significant competitive advantage by differentiating us from competitors that offer more limited engineering capabilities  manufacturing capacity and product selection 
we have used our capabilities in this area for customers in a number of industries  most notably semiconductor capital equipment and life and health sciences 
financial information regarding our business segments and our operations by geographic area is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k beginning on page f a discussion of our net sales by end market and geographic area is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
sales and marketing we market and sell our products and services through our domestic and international sales organizations  an international network of independent distributors and sales representatives  product catalogs and our web site 
our domestic and international sales organizations are comprised of teams of field sales persons  which work closely with strategic account managers  product and applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel based primarily in irvine  california  mountain view  california  stratford  connecticut  germany  france and japan 
we have aligned our domestic and international sales organizations along our two key categories of customers end users and oem customers 
these two categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements 
our oem subsystem and capital equipment customers often have unique technical specifications and manufacturing processes  and may require specific system  subsystem or component designs 
this requires close cooperation between our sales personnel and distributors and our engineering staff  and can result in long sales cycles for our subsystem and capital equipment products 
within our two key categories of customers  our sales personnel are organized into groups based on their special knowledge and expertise relating to specific product lines 
while these sales groups focus their attention and selling efforts in their areas of expertise  our entire sales organization collaborates closely to combine all of our areas of knowledge and expertise to offer integrated solutions to our customers 
we also actively market and sell our products in certain markets outside of north america through independent sales representatives and distributors 
we have written agreements with most of our representatives and distributors 
in some cases we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain of our products in a specific geographic area 
these agreements generally have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis  and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period 
most distributor agreements are structured to provide distributors with sales discounts below the domestic list price 
representatives are generally paid commissions for sales of products 
no single independent representative or distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in we also market our standard products through our product catalogs and our web site 
our principal marketing tool for the scientific research market is our comprehensive product catalog  the newport resource 
this catalog provides detailed product information as well as extensive technical and applications data 
we mail this catalog to approximately  existing and potential customers 
the newport resource is published in english  french  german and japanese 
new product supplements for each catalog are also distributed between publications 
we also publish and distribute a variety of sales literature and product brochures which focus on specific products and end markets 
our web site features an online catalog  providing customers with access to the latest information regarding our products  technical tutorial and application related materials  sales information  a literature and information request form  and the ability to purchase a majority of our standard products 
the web site is increasingly becoming the channel most widely used by our customers to review information about our technologies  products and services 
research and product development we continually seek to improve our technological leadership position through internal research  product development and licensing  and acquisitions of complementary technologies 
as of january   we had approximately employees engaged in research and development 
we continually work to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce innovative new products to satisfy the needs of our customers 
in addition  we regularly investigate new ways to combine components manufactured by our various operations to produce innovative technological solutions for the markets we serve 
total research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  million  or of net sales  in  which included the expenses of spectra physics for only the period after july   the date of acquisition  and million  or of net sales  in research and development expenses attributable to our lasers division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  and million  or of net sales to that segment  in  which consisted entirely of the expenses of spectra physics after july  research and development expenses attributable to our photonics and precision technologies division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  million  or of net sales to that segment  in  which included the expenses of spectra physics for only the period after july   and million  or of net sales to that segment  in we are committed to product development and expect to continue our investment in this area in the current and future years 
we believe that the continual development or acquisition of innovative new products will be critical to our future success 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
customers we sell our products to thousands of customers worldwide  in a wide range of diverse end markets  including scientific research  microelectronics manufacturing which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment and computer peripherals customers  aerospace and defense security  life and health sciences  industrial manufacturing and communications 
we believe that our customer diversification minimizes our dependence on any single industry or group of customers 
in  no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net sales  and no single customer represented or more of our net sales by our lasers division or our photonics and precision technologies division 
however  in certain of our end markets  including the microelectronics market  a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales to those markets 
we believe that our relationships with these key customers are good 
however  if our key customers discontinue or reduce their relationships with us  or suffer downturns in their businesses  it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short term basis  and our business and results of operations could be harmed going forward if we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business 
competition the primary end markets that we serve include scientific research  aerospace and defense security  microelectronics which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment and computer peripherals customers  life and health sciences  and other end markets which includes general industrial and communications customers 
these markets are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
a small number of competitors are dominant in certain of these markets 
the products and systems developed and manufactured by both our photonics and precision technologies division and our lasers division serve all of our target end markets

optometrics llc spectrogon crystals nkk shanghai institute of ceramics st 
gobain automated assembly and dispensing systems asymtek datacon technology ag esec palomar technologies speedline technologies  inc in our precision motion systems product lines  we also face competition from certain of our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop their own systems  subsystems and components 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are product features and performance  quality  reliability and service support  customer relationships  ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis  pricing  and ability to customize products to customer specifications 
we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
however  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
we compete in various markets against a number of companies  some of which have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of these companies have long established relationships with our customers and potential customers in our markets 
in addition to current competitors  we believe that new competitors  some of whom may have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us  will seek to provide products to one or more of our markets in the future 
such future competition could harm our business 
intellectual property and proprietary rights our success and competitiveness depends to an extent on our technology and other intellectual property such as trade secrets  patents and trademarks 
we protect our technology by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  customers and suppliers  and  in some cases  through the use of patents  trademark registrations and licenses 
we maintain approximately patents in the us and foreign jurisdictions  and we have approximately additional patent applications pending 
these issued patents cover various aspects of products in many of our key product categories  particularly our laser products 
we also have trademarks registered in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate 
it is possible that  despite our efforts  other parties may use  obtain or try to copy our products and technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult and time consuming 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we take to protect our rights will prevent any misappropriation of our products or technology 
this is particularly the case in foreign jurisdictions  where the intellectual property laws may not afford our intellectual property rights the same protection as the laws of the united states 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  infringement  invalidity  right to use or ownership claims by third parties may be asserted against us in the future 
we expect that the number and significance of these matters will increase as our business expands 
in particular  the laser industry is characterized by a very large number of patents  many of which are of questionable validity and some of which appear to overlap with other issued patents 
as a result  there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry regarding patent protection and infringement 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing we manufacture lasers and laser systems at our domestic facility located in mountain view  california  and at our international facility in stahnsdorf  germany 
we manufacture diode lasers in tucson  arizona 
we manufacture instruments  components  subassemblies and systems at domestic facilities located in irvine  california  stratford  connecticut  franklin  massachusetts  north billerica  massachusetts  and rochester  new york  and at international facilities in beaune la rolande  france  brigueuil  france  and margate  united kingdom 
in addition  we subcontract the manufacture of various products and components to a number of third party subcontractors 
our manufacturing processes are diverse and consist of purchasing raw materials  principally stainless steel  aluminum and glass  processing the raw materials into components  subassemblies and finished products  purchasing components  assembling and testing components and subassemblies  and  for our larger products  assembling the subassemblies and components into integrated systems 
we primarily design and manufacture our products internally  although on a limited basis  we purchase completed products from certain third party suppliers and resell those products through our distribution system 
most of these completed products are produced to our specifications and carry our name and logo 
we currently procure various components and materials  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  and the laser crystals used in certain of our laser products  from single sources due to unique component designs or material characteristics as well as certain quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
in addition  we manufacture certain components internally  and there are no readily available third party suppliers of these components 
if single sourced components were to become unavailable in adequate amounts at acceptable quality levels or were to become unavailable on terms satisfactory to us  we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
while we believe that we would be able to obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  if we are unable to do so our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
backlog our consolidated backlog of orders totaled million at december   and million at january  as of december   million of our consolidated backlog was scheduled to be shipped on or before december  orders for many of the products we sell to the semiconductor equipment market  which comprise a significant portion of our sales  are often subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer without penalty  and we have from time to time experienced significant cancellations and pushouts of orders from these markets  which negatively affected our operating results in those periods 
in addition  because we manufacture a significant portion of our standard catalog products for inventory  we often make shipments of these products upon or within a short time period following receipt of an order 
as a result  our backlog of orders at any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of our sales for succeeding periods 
investments from time to time  we make investments in companies having operations or technologies in areas which are within or adjacent to our strategic focus when acquired 
we currently hold minority ownership interests in a number of small  privately held companies 
these investments are designed to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives 
we want to support growth in new technologies  particularly those related to our strategic markets  in order to create and expand markets for our products 
while financial returns are not our primary goal  our strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have a positive impact on their markets 
at december   the total carrying value of all of our minority interest investments was million 
investments in technology companies involve significant risks  including the risks that such companies may be unable to raise additional required operating capital on acceptable terms or at all  or may not achieve or maintain market acceptance of their technology or products 
in the event that any of such risks occurs  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
in addition  because there is no public market for the securities we acquire  our ability to liquidate our investments is limited  and such markets may not develop in the future 
in  we determined that a minority interest investment made in prior years in a manufacturer of precision mechanical components had incurred an other than temporary reduction in value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down the investment to its estimated fair value 
in the event that we are required to write down the carrying value of one or more of our investments in the future  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
employees as of january   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good 
government regulation regulatory compliance our lasers and laser based systems are subject to the laser radiation safety regulations of the radiation control for health and safety act administered by the center for devices and radiological health of the united states food and drug administration 
among other things  these regulations require a laser manufacturer to file new product and annual reports  to maintain quality control and sales records  to perform product testing  to distribute appropriate operating manuals  to incorporate certain design and operating features in lasers sold to end users and to certify and label each laser sold to end users as one of four classes based on the level of radiation from the laser that is accessible to users 
various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed depending on the class of product 
the center for devices and radiological health is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of the regulatory requirements 
we are also subject to comparable laser safety regulations with regard to laser products sold in europe 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with these regulations 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to various federal  state and local environmental protection regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
in the united states  we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the environmental protection agency epa 
comparable authorities exist in other countries 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident involving such materials  we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage if any and the resources of our business 
spectra physics mountain view  california facility is an epa designated superfund site and is subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the california regional water quality control board 
spectra physics  along with several other entities with facilities located near the mountain view  california facility  have been identified as responsible parties with respect to this superfund site  due to releases of hazardous substances during the s and s 
the site is mature  and investigations and remediation efforts have been ongoing for approximately years 
spectra physics and the other responsible parties have entered into a cost sharing agreement covering the costs of remediating the off site groundwater impact 
we have established reserves relating to the estimated cost of these remediation efforts  however our ultimate costs of remediation are difficult to predict 
in addition  while we are not aware of any unresolved property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site  such claims could be made against us in the future 
while thermo electron corporation has agreed in connection with our purchase of spectra physics to indemnify us  subject to certain conditions  for environmental liabilities relating to this site in excess of our reserves  this indemnity may not cover all liabilities relating to this site 
in such event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  the european union has enacted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee for implementation in each european union member country 
rohs regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products  and weee requires the collection  reuse and recycling of waste from certain products 
the european union member states are in the process of implementing rohs and weee  and it is likely that each jurisdiction will interpret rohs and weee differently in the course of implementation 
based on information we have received to date  certain of our products sold in these countries are or will likely be subject to rohs and weee requirements 
we will continue to monitor rohs and weee guidance as it is announced by individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities 
the incomplete guidance available to us to date suggests that in some instances we may not be directly responsible for compliance with rohs and weee because some of our products may be subject to exemptions 
however  because some products may not be exempt and because the products are sold under our brand name  we will likely be directly or contractually subject to such regulations in the case of many of our products 
also  final legislation from individual jurisdictions may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us 
we are also aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or being considered in the united states  as well as other countries  such as japan and china 
our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs  fines or penalties and third party claims  and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in these regions

item a 
risk factors the following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors and or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
these fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including fluctuations in our customers capital spending  industry cyclicality particularly in the semiconductor industry  levels of government funding available to our customers  and other economic conditions within the markets we serve  demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  the level of orders within a given quarter and preceding quarters  the timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders for our products  the timing of product shipments within a given quarter  our timing in introducing new products  variations in the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  timing of new product introductions by our competitors  the availability and cost of key components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products  our ability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our products to meet customer demand  our ability to retain and attract key employees  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and our levels of expenses 
we may in the future choose to change prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by competitors or in an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
these actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the results of previous quarters 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of the quarter 
thus  unexpected variations in timing of sales  particularly for our higher priced  higher margin products such as our laser products  can cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers  particularly our largest customers  cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
also  we base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter 
if the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast  we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter  which would result in delays in the shipment of our products and could shift sales to a subsequent period 
in addition  our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales  and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly to compensate for the shortfall 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
in any period  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
we are dependent in part on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile and unpredictable 
a significant portion of our current and expected future business comes from sales of components  subsystems and laser products to manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication  wafer inspection and metrology equipment and sales of capital equipment to disk drive and integrated semiconductor device manufacturers 
the semiconductor equipment market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the timing  severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles 
the continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market 
during industry downturns  our revenues from this market will decline suddenly and significantly 
our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next generation product technology and to support and service our products 
in addition  due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market  we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell 
accordingly  downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results 
conversely  when upturns in this market occur  we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid  and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales to the microelectronics market  and if we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail their purchases of our products  our results of operations would be harmed 
our sales to the microelectronics market which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment and computer peripherals customers constituted  and of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december   the year ended january  which included spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and the year ended december   respectively 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales to this market 
our top five customers in this market comprised approximately   and of our sales to this market for the year ended december   the year ended january  which included spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and the year ended december   respectively 
no single customer in this market comprised or more of our consolidated net sales in if any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us  replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business  our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  because a relatively small number of companies dominate the front end equipment portion of this market  and because those companies rarely change vendors in the middle of a product s life cycle  it may be particularly difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
the microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets  their products and components may not achieve  or continue to achieve  anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance  it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in developing our systems and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these systems and or subsystems to such customers 
a failure on the part of our customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the semiconductor capital equipment market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
difficulties in executing our acquisitions could adversely impact our business 
the spectra physics acquisition  which we completed in july  is the largest acquisition we have completed  and the complex process of integrating spectra physics required significant resources 
we continue to face ongoing business challenges that primarily include the geographic dispersion of our operations and realizing the potential benefits of the combined company s expanded product line in our end markets 
although the integration of spectra physics is complete  we will continue to incur cash outflows and additional costs related to this acquisition 
we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses  and the efficient and effective integration of our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our operations requires significant resources and is time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
further  we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant challenges potentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies  incorporating the acquired company s technology and products into our current and future product lines  and successfully generating market demand for these expanded product lines  potential additional geographic dispersion of operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the difficulty in achieving anticipated synergies and efficiencies  the difficulty in leveraging the acquired company s and our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and our ability to retain key customers and employees of an acquired company 
our failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any past or future acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies we acquire could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we may incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make 
many of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
many of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to anticipate and address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology  either through internal development or by acquisitions  and to be price competitive 
if we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products  it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
in addition  because certain of our markets experience severe cyclicality in capital spending  if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns  and may fail to have our products or subsystems designed into our customers products 
we may not be successful in acquiring  developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately introduce new  competitive products on a timely basis  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve 
we offer products for a number of markets  including microelectronics manufacturing  scientific research  aerospace and defense security  life and health sciences  industrial manufacturing and communications 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the needs  standards and technical requirements of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming 
we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
because the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict  and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our capital equipment  system and subsystem products are complex  and customers for these products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  or require us to perform extensive configuration  testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
the sales cycle for our capital equipment  system and subsystem products from initial contact through shipment typically varies  is difficult to predict and can last as long as one year 
the orders comprising our backlog are generally subject to cancellation and changes in delivery schedules by our customers without significant penalty 
we have from time to time experienced order rescheduling and cancellations that have caused our revenues in a given period to be materially less than would have been expected based on our backlog at the beginning of the period 
if we experience such rescheduling and or cancellations in the future  our operating results will fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations could harm our results of operations 
if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  our operating results will suffer 
because certain of our products  particularly lasers  are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
in addition  because certain of our markets  such as the semiconductor equipment market  are highly cyclical in nature  if we fail to timely introduce new products in advance of an upturn in the market s cycle  we may be foreclosed from selling products to many customers until the next cycle 
as such  our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
we face significant risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
for the year ended december   the year ended january  which included spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and the year ended december   our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales  with a substantial portion of international sales originating in europe and  subsequent to our acquisition of spectra physics  in japan 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future  and that in particular  the proportion of our sales to asian customers will continue to increase as a result of the purchase of spectra physics 
our international operations expose us to various risks  which include adverse changes or instability in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products  challenges of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements including export requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection periods  overlapping  differing or more burdensome tax structures  adverse currency fluctuations  differing protection of intellectual property  difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  increased risk of exposure to terrorist activities  and trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets  potentially making our products less price competitive 
such exchange rate fluctuations could also increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
if we experience any of the risks associated with international business  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we face substantial competition  and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized markets  against a limited number of companies in each market 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours  or who engage subcontract manufacturers to manufacture subassembly products on their behalf 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy greater name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
other competitors are small and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product performance  features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  we may lose our competitive advantage 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed 
we have in the past and may in the future be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
moreover  our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation  the diversion of our technical and management personnel and the assertion of counterclaims by the defendants  including counterclaims asserting invalidity of our patents 
for example  we have notified several manufacturers of semiconductor wafer handling robots and load ports that we believe that they are infringing upon certain of our us patents  and may institute litigation against one or more of such companies in the future 
we will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  intellectual property infringement claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights held by them 
whenever such claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology may divert management s attention from other matters and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products 
any such claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  and we have recently experienced attrition in certain management  engineering and product marketing positions 
if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain our employees  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
our reliance on sole source and limited source suppliers could result in delays in production and distribution of our products 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  and the laser crystals used in certain of our laser products  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts at acceptable quality levels or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our business and results of operations 
our products could contain defects  which would increase our costs and harm our business 
certain of our products  especially our laser and automation products  are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
further  the manufacture of these products often involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of these products  design defects  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could adversely affect our manufacturing yields and product reliability  which could in turn harm our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships 
we provide warranties for our products  and we accrue allowances for estimated warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue for the sale of the products 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
we establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for our products 
if actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required in future periods 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  some of our products are combined with products from other suppliers  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  or legal action by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims which  if successful  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we currently maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept  if at all 
this insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting each year  and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to furnish a report by our management each year on our internal control over financial reporting 
this report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
this report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems 
auditing standard no 
provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and  particularly because section and auditing standard no 
are relatively new  some of the judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation and  therefore  the report may be uniquely difficult to prepare  and our auditors may not agree with our assessments 
if we are unable to assert each year that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
in addition  if any unidentified material weaknesses were to result in fraudulent activity and or a material misstatement or omission in our financial statements  we could suffer losses and be subject to civil and criminal penalties  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
difficulties in implementing a new global information technology system could harm our business 
we have begun the implementation of a new global information technology system 
our operations in different geographic areas are currently managed and monitored with a number of different and in some cases incompatible legacy software systems  many of which were implemented long before we acquired these operations 
we anticipate that our new system  once implemented  will enable the more centralized  streamlined and efficient operation and monitoring of our business 
we currently expect that the implementation will proceed in stages across the geographic breadth of the company  and will require a minimum of two years for completion 
we anticipate incurring significant financial and resource costs in connection with the implementation of the new system  and our business will be subject to many difficulties as we replace the various legacy software systems that we currently use to manage and monitor our operations 
these difficulties include disruption of our operations  loss of data  and the diversion of our management and key employees attention away from other business matters 
the difficulties associated with the implementation  and our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from the implementation  could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
compliance with environmental regulations and potential environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local environmental protection regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
in the united states  we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the environmental protection agency epa 
comparable authorities are involved in other countries 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident involving such materials  we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage if any and the resources of our business 
spectra physics mountain view  california facility is an epa designated superfund site and is subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the california regional water quality control board 
spectra physics  along with several other entities with facilities located near the mountain view  california facility  have been identified as responsible parties with respect to this superfund site  due to releases of hazardous substances during the s and s 
the site is mature  and investigations and remediation efforts have been ongoing for approximately years 
spectra physics and the other responsible parties have entered into a cost sharing agreement covering the costs of remediating the off site groundwater impact 
we have established reserves relating to the estimated cost of these remediation efforts  however our ultimate costs of remediation are difficult to predict 
in addition  while we are not aware of any unresolved property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site  such claims could be made against us in the future 
while thermo electron corporation has agreed in connection with our purchase of spectra physics to indemnify us  subject to certain conditions  for environmental liabilities relating to this site in excess of our reserves  this indemnity may not cover all liabilities relating to this site 
in such event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
these environmental regulations also include a variety of federal  state  local and international environmental regulations restricting the use and disposal of materials used in the manufacture of our products  or requiring design changes or recycling of our products 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities  the suspension of manufacturing or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to equip our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  including expenses associated with the recall of any non compliant product and the management of historical waste 
from time to time new regulations are enacted  and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced 
we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted 
for example  the european union has enacted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee for implementation in each european union member country 
rohs regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products  and weee requires the collection  reuse and recycling of waste from certain products 
the european union member states are in the process of implementing rohs and weee  and it is likely that each jurisdiction will interpret rohs and weee differently in the course of implementation 
based on information we have received to date  certain of our products sold in these countries are or will likely be subject to rohs and weee requirements 
we will continue to monitor rohs and weee guidance as it is announced by individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities 
the incomplete guidance available to us to date suggests that in some instances we may not be directly responsible for compliance with rohs and weee because some of our products may be subject to exemptions 
however  because some products may not be exempt and because the products are sold under our brand name  we may at times become contractually or directly subject to such regulations 
also  final legislation from individual jurisdictions may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us 
we are also aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or being considered in the united states  as well as other countries  such as japan and china 
our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs  fines or penalties and third party claims  and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in these regions 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt or shut down our operations  which would negatively impact our operations 
we are headquartered  and have significant operations  in the state of california and other areas where our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
we currently do not have comprehensive disaster recovery plans for all of our operations and facilities  and we have not formulated a companywide disaster recovery plan 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss or significant power outages  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report of form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are based on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview the following is a discussion and analysis of certain factors that have affected our results of operations and financial condition during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
acquisitions and divestitures in july  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of spectra physics 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method 
our results of operations for include the results of operations of spectra physics from the date of acquisition on july  see further discussion regarding this transaction in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
following our acquisition of spectra physics  we conducted a strategic review of all of our businesses and concluded that our robotic systems operations in richmond  california  which serve the front end semiconductor equipment industry with product lines including wafer handling robots  load ports and equipment front end modules  were no longer core to our overall strategy 
consequently  in  our board of directors approved a plan to sell these operations 
at that time  we classified our entire robotic systems operations as discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we determined that we would have ongoing cash flows from an identifiable component of these operations 
accordingly  our results of operations for this component for all periods presented were reclassified into continuing operations 
the remaining robotic systems operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the amounts of this component that have been included in continuing operations are as follows for the year ended in thousands december  january  december  net sales income loss before income taxes we completed the sale of our robotic systems operations in the fourth quarter of for a cash payment of million and a note receivable of million 
in  to increase the efficiency of our product development and manufacturing efforts  our board of directors approved a plan to sell our operations in plymouth  minnesota  which manufactured high precision motion stages for the semiconductor equipment  computer peripherals  fiber optic communications and life and health sciences industries 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to write down the assets of our plymouth operations to their estimated fair value of million 
in  due to the weak response from potential buyers  we shut down the operations and liquidated the majority of the remaining assets  which resulted in an additional loss of million 
in february  we settled an outstanding dispute relating to our sale in of a substantial portion of our former industrial metrology systems division 
as a result  we recorded a charge to discontinued operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the net sales and loss before income taxes from the discontinued operations were as follows for the year ended in thousands december  january  december  net sales loss before income taxes these divestitures have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the realized losses recognized on these divestitures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unless otherwise indicated  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes discontinued operations and relates only to continuing operations 
extraordinary gain in march  we settled a dispute arising out of our acquisition of micro robotics systems  inc mrsi 
as a result of this settlement  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million in the first quarter of pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement   shares of our common stock  which were being held in escrow  were returned to us and cancelled 
such shares had been issued to the former mrsi stockholders at the time of the acquisition of mrsi  or had been issued upon the exercise of options to purchase our common stock which had been granted at the time of the acquisition in connection with the assumption and conversion of options to purchase mrsi common stock 
in addition  outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock were cancelled and the exercise prices of all remaining outstanding options which had been granted in connection with the mrsi acquisition were increased to reflect an adjustment to the total consideration paid for the acquisition 
stockholders equity transactions in may  we purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of per share for a total of million 
in june  we purchased  shares of our common stock from thermo electron corporation thermo that we previously issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition of spectra physics from thermo in july we purchased the shares at a price of per share for a total of million 
in august  we received and cancelled  shares of common stock in payment of taxes owed on ordinary income recognized by certain employees upon vesting of shares of restricted stock issued to them under our stock incentive plan 
at the time they were received  these shares had a value of per share for a total of million 
fiscal year end effective in  we began using a conventional week accounting fiscal year 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december  and our fiscal quarters end on the saturday closest to the end of each corresponding calendar quarter 
fiscal year referred to herein as ended on december   fiscal year referred to herein as ended on january  and fiscal year referred to herein as ended on december  end markets in connection with our acquisition of spectra physics in the third quarter of  we realigned our end markets into four customer markets scientific research  aerospace and defense security  microelectronics which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment and computer peripherals customers  life and health sciences  and all other end markets which include general industrial and communications customers 
our discussion of our results of operations includes comparisons within these end markets  and we have reclassified our results for the fiscal year ended december  to conform to this realignment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  restructuring reserves  asset impairment valuations  pension liabilities and income tax valuations 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue after title to and risk of loss of products have passed to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment from our facilities  or delivery of the service has been completed  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  as each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value  determined based upon the price that would be charged on a standalone basis 
if a portion of the total contract price is not payable until installation is complete  we do not recognize such portion as revenue until completion of installation  however  we record the full cost of the product at the time of shipment 
revenue for training is deferred until the service is completed 
revenue for extended service contracts is recognized over the related contract periods 
our customers generally have days from the original invoice date generally days for international customers to return a standard catalog product purchase for exchange or credit 
catalog products must be returned in the original condition and meet certain other criteria 
product returns of catalog items have historically been insignificant and are charged against revenue in the period returned 
custom  option configured and certain other products as defined in the terms and conditions of sale cannot be returned 
for certain non catalog products  we establish a sales return reserve based on the historical product returns 
accounts and notes receivable we record reserves for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection  as well as a reserve based on our historical collections experience 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by reviewing past due invoices and assessing the current creditworthiness of each customer 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables 
in the first quarter of  we revised our method of estimating our reserve based upon our historical collections experience 
as a result of this revision  our allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by approximately million in  which reduced selling  general and administrative expense 
certain of our japanese customers provide us with promissory notes on the due date of the receivable 
the payment dates of the promissory notes range between and days from the original receivable due date 
for balance sheet presentation purposes  amounts due to us under such promissory notes are reclassified from accounts receivable to current notes receivable 
at december  and january   notes receivable  net totaled million and million  respectively 
subsequently  certain of these promissory notes are sold with recourse under line of credit agreements to one of four banks in japan with which we do business 
such transactions are conducted in the ordinary course of business 
the principal amount of promissory notes sold with recourse is included in both notes receivable  net and short term obligations until the underlying note obligations are ultimately satisfied by payment by the customers to the banks 
at december  and january   the principal amounts of such promissory notes included in notes receivable  net and short term obligations totaled million and million  respectively 
pension plans several of our non us subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full time employees at those subsidiaries 
some of the plans are unfunded  as permitted under the plans and applicable laws 
for financial reporting purposes  the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  an assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan 
all of these assumptions are based upon our judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost determined on either a first in  first out fifo or average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
we record any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of sales 
warranty unless otherwise stated in our product literature or in our agreements with our customers  products sold by our photonics and precision technologies division generally carry a one year warranty from the original invoice date on all product material and workmanship 
products of such division sold to original equipment manufacturer oem customers generally carry longer warranties  typically to months 
products sold by our lasers division generally carry warranties that vary by product and product component  but generally range from days to two years 
in certain cases  such warranties for lasers division products are limited by either a set calendar period or a maximum amount of usage of the product  whichever occurs first 
defective products will be either repaired or replaced  generally at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision based on historical experience for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage and or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligation would be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
impairment of assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments  related primarily to the future profitability and or future value of the assets 
changes in our strategic plan and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technologies in areas which are within or adjacent to our strategic focus when acquired  all of which are privately held and whose values are difficult to determine 
we record an investment impairment charge in any reporting period where we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future changes in our strategic direction  adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to impairment tests based upon a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined  and the carrying value of the reporting units net assets  including goodwill 
sfas no 
requires a review of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when circumstances exist that would indicate an impairment of such goodwill or other intangible assets 
we perform the annual impairment review as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year 
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units at the completion of the purchase price allocation through specific identification  and is reallocated if the reporting units change 
we determine our reporting units by identifying those operating segments or components for which discrete financial information is available which is regularly reviewed by the management of that unit 
however  we aggregate components if they have similar economic characteristics 
we test for impairment of each of our reporting units by comparing the respective fair values of goodwill and or other intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial accounting and tax reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
accordingly  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in and for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
acquired tax liabilities related to prior tax returns of acquired entities at the date of purchase are recognized based on our best estimate of the ultimate settlement that may be accepted by the tax authorities 
we continually evaluate these tax related matters 
at the date of any material change in our best estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liability previously recognized is adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of spectra physics in  we recorded million in domestic deferred tax liabilities and million in domestic deferred tax assets 
the acquired net deferred tax liability of million in reduced our previously recorded net deferred tax asset accordingly 
the remainder of these deferred taxes was recorded as a reduction to goodwill in in  we determined that the ultimate realization of certain acquired deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
accordingly  we recorded these deferred tax assets  which reduced goodwill by approximately million 
we are subject to audit by federal  state or foreign tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
these audits often involve the questioning of the timing and amount of deductions  the apportionment of income among various tax jurisdictions  and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the potential tax exposures associated with various tax filing positions taken  we will establish a tax reserve for probable exposures where necessary 
during  as a result of the conclusion of a number of tax examinations with favorable results  the tax contingency reserve was reduced by approximately million 
during  we concluded a state tax examination related to research and experimentation credit claims for refund for the years ended december and december based on the favorable conclusion of this examination  we recorded a reduction in our tax contingency reserve of approximately million 
at december   we believe that we have appropriately reserved for probable tax exposures 
to the extent we subsequently prevail in matters for which tax reserves have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides several incentives for us multinational corporations and us manufacturers 
subject to certain limitations  the incentives include an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations that repatriate accumulated income abroad  and a deduction for domestic qualified production activities taxable income 
at present  we have no plans to repatriate foreign earnings under the ajca 
accrued restructuring costs restructuring plan in connection with the acquisition of spectra physics  our board of directors approved a preliminary restructuring plan to consolidate certain locations  which included million for employee relocation and employee severance and related termination costs and million in costs related to facility consolidations 
in  we finalized this plan  which included million for employee relocation and employee severance and related termination costs and million related to facility consolidation costs  resulting in a net increase of approximately million from the preliminary plan 
this increase resulted in an adjustment to goodwill of approximately million 
the following table summarizes the activity in accrued restructuring costs related to the purchase of spectra physics that involve the payment of cash in thousands employee relocation and severance facility consolidation total liabilities assumed in purchase accounting cash payments accrued restructuring at january  cash payments adjustments to restructuring plan accrued restructuring at december  the facility consolidation costs will be paid over the term of the lease for the closed facility  which expires in at december  and january   million and million  respectively  of these accrued restructuring costs were expected to be paid within one year and are included in current liabilities in accrued restructuring costs  and million and million  respectively  of accrued restructuring costs are included in long term liabilities in accrued restructuring costs and other liabilities 
restructuring plan during  in response to the continued severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved a restructuring and cost reduction plan designed to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at that time 
in  we increased our estimate of the required liability for facility consolidations by million to reflect revised estimates of reduced future sublease income 
this amount is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in and  we increased our estimate of the required reserve for facility consolidations by million and million  respectively  to reflect settlements of our remaining lease obligations for certain leases as well as revised estimates of future sublease income 
both of these amounts are included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
the following table summarizes the activity in accrued restructuring costs related to our restructuring plan in thousands employee severance facility consolidation total accrued restructuring at december  restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments reclassifications accrued restructuring at december  restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments accrued restructuring at january  restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments accrued restructuring at december  as of december   million of facility related costs remained accrued for under our restructuring plan

the increase in sales to international customers in compared with was due primarily to the addition of spectra physics sales from the july  acquisition date  which contributed million 
in addition  our existing businesses saw increased sales to international customers totaling million  or  compared with  due primarily to higher sales in europe 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
as the value of the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  sales in those currencies convert to more us dollars  conversely  when the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  sales in those countries convert to fewer us dollars 
currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results for compared with and we expect net sales to be up slightly in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to our strong backlog and strength in the microelectronics market  offset in part by reduced sales to the scientific research market due to the historical seasonality of that market 
however  our business is subject to risks arising from market conditions in our primary end markets  as well as from general economic conditions 
we expect that our sales to the scientific research  aerospace and defense security markets will be flat to down slightly in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to the historical seasonality in the scientific research market 
overall  we expect that our sales to these markets will fluctuate from period to period in line with changes in overall research and defense spending levels  but will increase over time as we increase our penetration of these markets 
we expect our sales to the microelectronics market to increase in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to the overall strength in this market 
the duration and extent of this improved market condition is difficult to predict and represents an uncertainty with respect to our future operating results 
we expect our sales to the life and health sciences market for the first quarter of to be flat to up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of in general  we expect our sales to this market to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis in the near term due to our concentration of significant oem customers in this market and the timing of their orders  but to increase over time as we increase our penetration of this market through the introduction of new products 
gross margin gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
gross margin for was positively impacted compared with by the higher absorption of fixed overhead resulting from the increased sales levels  by the inclusion of a full year of spectra physics higher overall gross margin sales in  by the benefits from the divestiture of our low margin manufacturing operations in oroville  california  which we completed early in the third quarter of  and by cost savings resulting from our global sourcing activities 
gross margin for was negatively impacted by certain charges to cost of sales  which are discussed in more detail below  that did not recur in gross margin for was positively impacted by the addition of spectra physics higher overall gross margin sales from the july  acquisition date  but this impact was more than offset by charges to cost of sales for acquisition  integration and other items 
these charges included million  or of net sales  related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to an amount that included a normal selling margin in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sold during the second half of these charges also included million  or of net sales  for inventory valuation reserves associated primarily with certain discontinued product lines 
in addition  gross margin in was negatively impacted by charges to cost of sales of million  or of net sales  related to the impairment of certain intangible assets of our former apas division and million  or of net sales  related to the impairment of an intellectual property intangible asset 
these impairment charges are discussed in more detail in note  restructuring  impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the first quarter of  we expect gross margins to improve slightly compared with the fourth quarter of  due primarily to the increased absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead resulting from our anticipated higher sales level  and to additional cost savings resulting from our global sourcing initiatives 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense sg a expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  for  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared with was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of spectra physics sg a expense in the remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in variable selling expenses and incentive compensation associated with higher sales volume  a full year of amortization of acquired intangible assets in related to the spectra physics acquisition  and increased accounting  auditing and tax services fees due to our increased size and to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act for spectra physics 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared with was attributable primarily to the addition of million of spectra physics sg a expense from the acquisition date of july  and to million of amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition 
the remainder of the increase in sg a expense in compared with was attributable primarily to an increase in variable selling expenses and incentive compensation associated with the higher sales volume  increased accounting and auditing fees due to our increased size  and outside consulting fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect that sg a expense will be slightly higher in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to the inclusion of the non cash expense related to stock options for the first time in in general  we expect that sg a expense will vary as a percentage of sales in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because the majority of our sg a expense is fixed in the short term  these changes in sg a expense will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
research and development r d expense r d expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  for  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared with was attributable primarily to the inclusion of a full year of spectra physics r d expense in  as well as to our increased investment in new product development programs in both of our business segments 
r d expense increased million  or  in compared with this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of million of r d expenses for spectra physics from the acquisition date of july  we expect that r d expense in the first quarter of will increase slightly compared with the fourth quarter of we believe that the continued development and advancement of our key products and technologies is critical to our future success  and we intend to continue to invest in key r d initiatives  while working to ensure that the efforts are focused and the funds are deployed efficiently 
in general  we expect that r d expense as a percentage of net sales will vary in the future based on sales level in any given period 
because of our commitment to continued product development  and because the majority of our r d expense is fixed in the short term  these changes in r d expense will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
restructuring  impairment and other charges we had no restructuring  impairment and other charges in restructuring  impairment and other charges totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the following table summarizes these charges year ended in thousands january  december  asset impairment  including goodwill severance in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that goodwill and other intangible assets at our former apas division were impaired 
in addition  in  we reviewed fixed assets at facilities impacted by the integration of spectra physics and identified duplicate and unnecessary assets 
as a result of these actions  we recorded charges of approximately million for impairment of goodwill and approximately million for impairment of other acquired intangible assets  as well as an investment impairment of million  and a fixed asset impairment of million 
of these impairment amounts  approximately million is included in cost of sales  approximately million is included in restructuring  impairment and other charges  and approximately million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits for during  in response to the continued severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved a restructuring and cost reduction plan designed to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at that time 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a charge of million in  of which million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
in and  we increased our estimate of the required reserve for facility consolidations under this plan by million and million  respectively  to reflect settlements of our remaining lease obligations for certain leases as well as revised estimates of future sublease income 
both amounts are included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
in  we recorded charges for severance costs of approximately million relating to cost reduction actions taken as part of the integration of spectra physics  of which million is included in restructuring  impairment and other charges  and million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
in  we recorded charges for severance costs of approximately million relating to cost reduction actions taken in that were not included in the original restructuring plan  of which million is included in restructuring  impairment and other charges and million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
these restructuring  impairment and other charges are discussed in more detail in note  restructuring  impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other expense  net  totaled million for each of and  and interest and other income  net totaled million for although interest and other expense  net in was flat compared with  there were a number of offsetting items between the two periods 
our interest expense was approximately million higher in compared with  due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of interest expense on both the debt that we issued in connection with the acquisition of spectra physics in july  as well as the lines of credit we assumed in connection with the acquisition 
in contrast  only included such interest expense for the period after the acquisition date of july  also  our interest income was approximately million less in compared with  due primarily to significantly lower average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from cash paid in connection with the spectra physics acquisition 
these factors were offset by a number of charges in that did not recur in  including a charge of million for losses on sale of marketable securities prior to their maturity in order to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the spectra physics acquisition  and a charge of million for the loss on a minority interest investment that incurred an other than temporary reduction in value 
interest and other expense  net was million in compared with million in interest and other income  net in interest income was approximately million lower in compared with  due primarily to lower interest income earned from lower yields on cash and marketable securities and lower average balances of cash and marketable securities resulting from cash paid to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for spectra physics 
our gains on sales of marketable securities were approximately million lower in compared with due to rising interest rates which caused our portfolio to shift to a net unrealized loss position 
in addition  our interest expense was approximately million higher in compared with  due primarily to the interest on both the debt we issued in connection with the spectra physics acquisition and the lines of credit we assumed in connection with the acquisition  both of which were not incurred in in addition  as noted above  we recorded a number of charges in that did not occur in we expect to incur interest and other expense  net  in future periods  due primarily to interest expense incurred on short term and long term debt  offset in part by interest earned on cash and marketable securities 
income taxes our effective tax rates from continuing operations were an expense of for  and benefits of and for and  respectively 
the income tax benefit in was attributable to federal income tax refunds and refundable foreign income tax incentives related to research and development  and to the favorable settlement of various internal revenue service examinations 
during  the internal revenue service and the california franchise tax board completed certain of their examinations 
based primarily on the favorable conclusions of these examinations  we recorded a reduction in our tax contingency reserve of approximately million  of which million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits 
we have recorded a valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings  should they occur  will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and pretax losses  should they occur  will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity net cash provided by our operating activities of million for was attributable primarily to the cash provided by our results of operations  offset in part by an increase in accounts and notes receivable as a result of higher sales in  an increase in inventories  and a decrease in accrued expenses including accrued restructuring costs due primarily to the timing of payments 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities and net proceeds of million from the sale of businesses and equity investments  offset in part by net purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
in december  our board of directors approved a global information technology systems initiative to consolidate our information systems onto a single platform 
in and  we expect to use a total of approximately million to million of cash for capital expenditures related to this implementation 
net cash used in financing activities of million for consisted of payments totaling million to purchase shares of our common stock as discussed below and payments of million for capital lease obligations  offset in part by proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and short term borrowings of million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
the majority of these securities are invested in one portfolio managed by a professional investment management firm  under the oversight of our senior financial management team 
this portfolio manager invests the funds allocated in accordance with our investment policy  which is reviewed regularly by our senior financial management and the audit committee of our board of directors 
we expect that our cash balances will fluctuate in the future based on factors such as cash used in or provided by ongoing operations  acquisitions or divestitures  investments in other companies  share repurchases  capital expenditures and contractual obligations  and changes in interest rates 
at december   we had a total of seven lines of credit  including one domestic revolving line of credit  two revolving lines of credit with japanese banks  and four other lines of credit with japanese banks  which are used to sell trade notes receivable with recourse to the banks 
our domestic revolving line of credit has a total credit limit of million and expires on december  certain of the marketable securities that are being managed by the lending institution collateralize this line of credit  which bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate at december  plus  at our option  and carries an unused line fee of per year 
at december   there were no balances outstanding under this line of credit  with million available  after considering outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
our two revolving lines of credit with japanese banks totaled billion yen million at december  and expire as follows million on march   million on may  and million on june  these lines are not secured and bear interest at the prevailing bank rate 
at december   we had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under these lines of credit 
approximately million of the amount outstanding under these revolving lines of credit at december  is included in short term obligations  and approximately million is included in long term debt  as the due date of this portion of the outstanding borrowings is june  our four other lines of credit with japanese banks  which are used to sell trade notes receivable with recourse to the banks  totaled million yen million at december   have no expiration date and bear interest at the bank s prevailing rate 
at december   we had million outstanding and million available for the sale of notes receivable under these lines of credit 
amounts outstanding under these lines of credit are included in short term obligations 
the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings on all six japanese lines of credit as of december  was 
in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  authorizing the purchase of up to million shares  or of our then outstanding stock 
in  we purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of per share for a total of million 
also in  we purchased  shares of our common stock from thermo that we previously issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition of spectra physics from thermo in july we purchased the shares at a price of per share for a total of million 
in  we did not make any purchases under this program 
in  we repurchased  shares under this program at a cost of million 
as of december    shares remained available for purchase under the share repurchase program 
the timing and amount of any future purchases will depend on factors including our share price  cash balances  expected cash requirements and general business and market conditions 
in the third quarter of  we also received and cancelled  shares of common stock in payment of taxes owed on ordinary income recognized by certain employees upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock issued to them under our stock incentive plan 
at the time they were received  these shares had a value of per share for a total of million 
contractual obligations we lease certain of our manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under non cancelable leases  certain of which contain renewal options 
in addition to the base rent  we are generally required to pay insurance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses and  in some cases  additional rentals based on increases in the consumer price index 
as of december   we had no material purchase obligations 
our long term debt  and capital and operating lease obligations at december  are summarized as follows in thousands capital leases operating leases long term debt total obligations payments due by period thereafter total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum capital lease payments we believe our current working capital position  together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures including the aforementioned information systems expenditures  debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risk factors on pages  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
except for the aforementioned capital expenditures  we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies or any material capital expenditures 
however  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and or investments in products  technologies  capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and or investments in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and or investments 
we cannot assure you that any such financing would be available  or that  if available  such financing would be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively  with all prior period financial statements presented on the basis of the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a correction of an error in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
 and requires us to account for employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans using the fair value method  and to record such value as a compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r will be effective as of january  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to the valuation model and the transition method that we choose under sfas no 
r  the accounting policies that we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  including the determination of assumptions regarding expected volatility  forfeiture rates  and life of the awards  the price of our stock on the date of award  and the number  types  terms and conditions of stock based awards to be granted each year 
we will use the black scholes valuation model  which we currently use for our pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
regarding stock based compensation 
we will use the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  the provisions of sfas no 
r will be applied to all awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  for all stock based awards that are outstanding and unvested as of the january  adoption date  compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting period  and will be based on the fair value of the awards determined as of the grant date as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
and adjusted for the effect of estimated forfeiture rates 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to our financial statements for the year ended december   our net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to our financial statements for and  net loss would have been increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no

further  sfas no

sfas no

will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
from time to time we use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts aa or a rated banks do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for any currency related fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses are included in our current net income loss in our statement of operations 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our reported results of operations for the last three years 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  or january  our operating income from international operations totaled million and million in and  respectively  and our operating loss from international operations was million for as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of international operations into us dollars affects the year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our future international operating profit loss include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and taiwan dollar 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have had a material effect on our reported net income for the year ended december  we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk the interest rates we pay on certain of our debt instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
our collateralized line of credit bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
our six revolving lines of credit with japanese banks bear interest at the lending bank s prevailing rate 
our investments in marketable securities  which totaled million at december   are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we estimate that a change in the interest rate earned on our investment portfolio or a change in interest rates on our line of credit would not have had a material effect on our net income for the sensitivity analyses described in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
