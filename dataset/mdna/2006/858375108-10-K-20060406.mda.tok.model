item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview stein mart s stores offer the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store  at prices competitive with off price retail chains 
currently with locations from california to new york  stein mart s focused assortment of merchandise features moderate to designer brand name apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes 
management believes that stein mart differentiates itself from typical off price retailers by offering i current season merchandise carried by better department and specialty stores at value prices  ii a stronger merchandising statement  with more depth of color and size  and iii merchandise presentation more comparable to other upscale retailers 
the company faces competition for customers and for access to quality merchandise from better department stores  fine specialty stores and  to a lesser degree  from off price retail chains 
many of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the retail apparel industry is highly fragmented and competitive  and the off price retail business may become even more competitive in the future

working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  the company s working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season

in december  the company amended its senior revolving credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders 
the principal purposes of the amendment were to extend the term of the agreement to january  decrease the maximum credit from million to million  add an option to increase the facility by an additional million  and reduce interest rates and unused line fees 
at january   there were no direct borrowings and no event of default existed under the terms of the agreement 
the company believes that expected net cash provided by operating activities and unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund anticipated current and long term capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  management can borrow on the revolving credit agreement or adjust operating plans  including new store rollout 
contractual obligations to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations  the following payments due by period data is provided total less than year years years after years operating leases at january   the company had no direct borrowings on its credit facility 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include deferred income taxes  deferred compensation and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect the financial condition of the company 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of the company s merchandise sales and earnings generated in the fall and holiday selling seasons 
accordingly  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances 
the company receives allowances from some of its vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursements  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold and damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise 
long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
store closing costs 
the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to record store closing costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
insurance reserve estimates 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of the company s merchandise is recognized at the time of sale  net of any returns and allowances  discounts and percentage off coupons 
future merchandise returns are estimated based on historical experience 
leased department sales are excluded from net sales  commissions  net of related selling expenses  and rental income from leased departments are included in other income  net 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
certain lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term and records the difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent liability 
the landlord lessor constructs the building leasehold improvements for the majority of the company s stores 
for other store operating leases which require the company lessee to construct the building leasehold improvements  these assets are considered to be landlord assets and the company records the cost of these leasehold improvements in excess of any landlord construction allowance received as prepaid rent which is amortized to rent expense over the lease term
