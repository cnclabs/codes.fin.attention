forward looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact 
words such as anticipates  in the opinion  believes  intends  expects  may  will  should  could  plans  forecasts  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  continue  and similar expressions may be intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below  and  in particular  the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k included elsewhere herein 
these factors include the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the aarohi communications  inc aarohi acquisition on a timely basis or at all  the company s ability to complete the acquisition of the recently announced proposed acquisition of sierra logic  inc sierra logic  the company s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of sierra logic  if such transaction is completed  and the company s ability to integrate the technology  operations  and personnel of aarohi and  if acquired  sierra logic  into its existing operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the fact that the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  have been in a state of uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future and makes it impossible to determine if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
in the past  our results have been significantly impacted by a widespread slowdown in information technology investment that pressured the storage networking market that is the mainstay of our business 
a downturn in information technology spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer oem customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payments  the emergence of new or stronger competitors as a result of consolidation movements in the market  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable booking patterns of our customers  the effects of terrorist activities  natural disasters  and resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products  as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  our ability and the ability of our oem customers to keep pace with the rapid

table of contents fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to approximately million in fiscal from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products in fiscal were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to approximately million in fiscal  and represented substantially all of our net revenues 
the following chart details our net revenues by product line in fiscal years and net revenues by product line percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands fibre channel ip networking other total net revenues our fibre channel products consist of both our lightpulse and inspeed products 
the increase in our fibre channel products in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to an increase of approximately in units shipped of our lightpulse products and an increase of approximately in units shipped of our inspeed products  partially offset by average selling price asp erosion of approximately and  respectively 
our ip networking products consist of iscsi and intelligent network products  as well as legacy vi and clan products 
we did not have any revenues generated by the legacy vi and clan traditional networking products in fiscal as those products have all entered end of life status 
in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect purchases are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect purchases are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded of our net revenues in fiscal years and were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage emc hewlett packard ibm info x amounts less than are not presented 
customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers  and other third parties are included with the oem s revenues in these columns rather than as revenue for the distributors  resellers or other third parties 
direct sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of total net revenues for fiscal years and  and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 

table of contents from a sales channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were approximately of net revenues and sales through distribution were approximately in fiscal which remained similar to net revenues from oem customers of approximately and sales through distribution of approximately in fiscal the following chart details our net revenues by sales channel in fiscal years and net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our existing and new oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  on our revenues of product certifications and qualifications 
in fiscal  domestic net revenues increased by approximately million  or  and international net revenues increased by approximately million  or  compared to fiscal the following chart details our net domestic and international revenues based on billed to location in fiscal years and net domestic and international revenues percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change in thousands united states pacific rim countries europe and rest of the world total net revenues we believe the increases in domestic and international net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal were principally a function of the overall size of the market for fibre channel products 
the decline in net revenues for the pacific rim countries and an increase in the europe and rest of the world net revenues were mainly due to a change in the bill to location for one of our key embedded customers 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales included the cost of production of finished products  amortization expense related to core technology and developed technology intangible assets as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality  and order fulfillment 
approximately million and million of amortization of technology intangible assets were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
further  approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal was mainly due to an increase in net revenues 
gross margin remained flat at approximately in fiscal and fiscal the company anticipates gross margin will trend down over time as faster growing blade servers and embedded products become a bigger portion of our business 

table of contents engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development  and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  and computer service costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million as a result of adopting sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal and a net increase in engineering headcount and other engineering expenses of approximately million as a result of the acquisition of aarohi communications  inc aarohi on may  the company will continue to invest in engineering and development activities and anticipates expenditures will continue to grow in this area with the recent aarohi acquisition and the pending sierra logic acquisition 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs  and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately of net revenues in fiscal years and the increase was mainly due to an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million as a result of adopting sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal the company will continue to target advertising and promotions in our new and existing products in an effort to provide overall revenue growth 
general and administrative 
ongoing general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to an increase in share based compensation expense recorded of approximately million as a result of adopting sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal and reimbursement of approximately million received from our insurance carriers in fiscal related to the shareholder litigation settled  which reduced fiscal general and administrative expenses 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets included the amortization of intangible assets such as patents  customer relationships  trade name  and covenants not to compete with estimable lives 
in fiscal year  amortization was for intangible assets related to the acquisition of aarohi communications  inc aarohi that was completed during fiscal and prior acquisitions 
in fiscal year  amortization was for the acquisitions of vixel corporation vixel and giganet  inc giganet that were completed during fiscal years and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately of net revenues in fiscal years and the decrease was mainly due to tax adjustments resulting from exercising of acquisition related non qualified stock options reducing acquisition related intangible assets as the acquisition related goodwill had already been impaired in fiscal impairment of goodwill 
as a result of a sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test  we fully impaired goodwill as of june  in connection with the preparation of vixel s tax return during fiscal  we revised estimates and discovered errors related to the deferred tax assets of vixel acquired in fiscal 
these events resulted in a revision to vixel s purchase price allocation to decrease net deferred tax assets and increased goodwill  which was impaired in fiscal this resulted in a million impairment of goodwill charge in fiscal additionally  during the preparation of the fiscal tax provision  we discovered errors related to the deferred tax liabilities of giganet acquired in fiscal 
this resulted in a million reduction of the previously recorded goodwill charge of million  resulting in a net goodwill impairment of approximately 
table of contents million for fiscal we do not believe that this million impairment of goodwill is material to fiscal or to fiscal operations or financial results 
excluding this adjustment  net income for fiscal would have been million 
in process research and development 
the in process research and development expense of approximately million recorded in fiscal was related to our acquisition of aarohi in may there was no in process research and development expense for fiscal nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
nonoperating income  net decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal the net decrease was mainly due to a net gain on the partial repurchase of our convertible notes of approximately million in fiscal  offset by higher interest income of approximately million due to higher interest rates in fiscal  and lower interest expense of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the partial repurchase of our convertible notes 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately and of income before income taxes in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the nondeductible aarohi in process research and development expenses and the increase in nondeductible share based compensation expenses in fiscal fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal on a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal  and represented substantially all of our net revenues

we believe the increase in international net revenues at a much higher rate than domestic net revenues is due to the continued increase in market acceptance of fibre channel products outside of the united states 
however  because we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales included the cost of production of finished products  amortization expense related to core technology and developed technology as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality  and order fulfillment 
approximately million and million of amortization of technology intangible assets were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively

engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses were approximately million and approximately million in fiscal years and  representing approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
engineering and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the engineering and development expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel for all of fiscal versus only a part of the corresponding period of fiscal since we completed our integration of vixel s day to day operations during the months ended march   we no longer separately track former vixel operations 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations were estimated to account for approximately million of the overall million increase 
the remaining increase was due to our continued investment in our storage networking infrastructure product development 
engineering and development expenses included approximately million and approximately million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for fiscal years and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing 
table of contents expenses were approximately million and million in fiscal years and  representing and of net revenues  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal this increase was partially due to the inclusion of the selling and marketing expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel for all of fiscal as opposed to a portion of fiscal as discussed previously  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations were estimated to account for approximately million of the overall million increase in selling and marketing expenses 
additionally  due to our increased focus on expanding sales and advertising programs during fiscal  selling and marketing expenses related to personnel and advertising and other promotions for fiscal increased by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses included approximately million and approximately million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for the fiscal years and  respectively 
as a portion of selling and marketing expenses  such as selling and marketing employees base compensation and amortized deferred stock based compensation expense  is not driven directly by increases or decreases in net revenues  the expenses fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
general and administrative 
ongoing general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million and approximately million in fiscal years and  representing and of net revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal included a million reduction related to reimbursement received from our insurance carriers during the period  in excess of our receivable 
this reimbursement was primarily related to the shareholder litigation settled and recorded as general and administrative expense in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal  excluding this million insurance reimbursement  would have been million  or of net revenues  compared to approximately million  or of net revenues  for fiscal year this would represent a decrease of approximately million in fiscal excluding the insurance recovery  compared to fiscal similar to other operating expenses  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately million of the decrease in general and administrative expenses  as the majority of the general and administrative costs of vixel were redundant with the general and administrative costs of emulex corporation prior to the acquisition 
additionally  general and administrative expenses related to legal fees  insurance  and personnel costs decreased by approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  general and administrative expenses included approximately million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses included approximately million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets included the amortization of intangible assets such as patents  customer relationships  trade name  and covenants not to compete with estimable lives 
in fiscal years and  amortization was for intangible assets related to the purchase of vixel which was completed during fiscal  and the purchase of giganet  completed during fiscal the approximate million increase in amortization of intangibles to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal was due to the addition of amortization related to the vixel acquisition and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia for all of fiscal as compared to a portion of fiscal amortization of intangibles represented approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
on june   we announced that tepid demand experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of from of our customers resulted in lower than expected revenue  earnings and cash flows in the fourth fiscal quarter of and was expected to result in lower sequential revenue  earnings and cash flows in the first fiscal quarter of these events and circumstances resulted in a subsequent drop in our stock price  which indicated a potential impairment might have occurred 
as a result  we conducted a sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  analysis  as well as a 
table of contents sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test 
the results of the sfas no 
analysis indicated that our long lived assets were not impaired 
however  the sfas no 
analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired 
this determination was made at the reporting unit level and consisted of steps 
first  the fair value of our only reporting unit was determined  based on a market approach  and compared to its carrying amount 
next  as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of sfas no 
was performed 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
as a result of this sfas no 
analysis  we recognized a million charge for goodwill impairment during fiscal after recording this impairment charge  there was no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of june  in connection with the preparation of vixel s tax return during fiscal  we revised estimates and discovered errors related to the deferred tax assets of vixel acquired in fiscal 
these events resulted in a revision to vixel s purchase price allocation to decrease net deferred tax assets and increase goodwill  which was impaired in fiscal this resulted in a million impairment of goodwill charge in fiscal additionally  during the preparation of the fiscal tax provision  we discovered errors related to the deferred tax liabilities of giganet acquired in fiscal 
this resulted in a million reduction of the previously recorded goodwill charge of million  resulting in goodwill impairment of million for fiscal had these items been recorded in fiscal  our net loss would have been million higher  or million  instead of million 
we do not believe that this million impairment of goodwill is material to fiscal or to fiscal operations or financial results 
excluding this adjustment  net income for fiscal would have been million 
in process research and development expense 
the in process research and development expense of approximately million  or of net revenues  recorded in fiscal was related to our acquisition of vixel in november there was no in process research and development expense for fiscal nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
in fiscal  our nonoperating income increased by approximately million to approximately million  from nonoperating income of approximately million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in the net overall gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes by approximately million to approximately million in fiscal  from approximately million in fiscal additionally  interest income increased by approximately million to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  primarily due to the receipt of approximately million of interest related to an insurance reimbursement  higher overall balances of cash and investments  and some improvement in interest rates 
further  as a result of the lower amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes during fiscal  interest expense decreased by approximately million to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal income taxes 
in fiscal  income taxes increased approximately million to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a net loss before income taxes of approximately million  which included goodwill impairment of approximately million 
even though we had a loss before income taxes  we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in fiscal  as the goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges were not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges in fiscal  income tax expense would have been approximately of income before taxes compared to in fiscal the difference in the fiscal tax rate and the fiscal tax rate was primarily due to a reduction of state tax expense 
income taxes represented and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
we make certain sales through tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the distributors when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and various other marketing programs 
moreover  we account for these incentive programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we classify the costs of these programs based on the identifiable benefit received as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
warranty 
we provide a warranty of between and years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable historically  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of aarohi communications  inc aarohi  vixel corporation vixel and giganet  inc giganet and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia networks  inc trebia are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from months to years 
furthermore  periodically we assess whether our long lived assets including intangibles  should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future 
table of contents operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
as of july   we have a valuation allowance of approximately million established against capital loss carryforwards 
the company establishes reserves for tax contingencies that reflect its best estimate of deductions and credits that may not be sustained 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we are using the modified prospective transition method that provides for only the current and future period stock based awards to be measured and recognized at fair value 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award forfeiture rate 
the input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  the company may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact the company s results of operations in the period such changes are made 
please see notes and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for additional information and related disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources at july  we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  current investments  and long term investments 
for the fiscal years ended july   we have primarily funded our cash needs from operations 
additionally we issued convertible subordinated notes in fiscal  as discussed in more detail below 
as part of our commitment to the growth and diversification of storage networking infrastructure solutions  we have created and are currently executing a point plan  which is described in the executive overview above 
these strategies may result in additional acquisitions  investment into research and development activities  increased capital expenditures related to engineering and test equipment  and hiring of additional engineering talent 

table of contents on august   as part of our point plan  the company announced it would acquire sierra logic inc sierra logic  a privately held designer of semiconductors for storage networking equipment located in roseville  california  for up to approximately million in cash  assumed debt  assumed stock options  and employee equity incentive compensation 
the transaction is expected to close on or near september   subject to certain closing conditions 
in addition  subsequent to fiscal  the company invested approximately million in an early stage  privately held  company in the storage networking industry 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balances  investments and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  debt obligations  and our acquisition strategy for at least the next months 
specifically  we believe our cash and investment resources will enable us to repay our outstanding convertible notes with a face value of approximately million as of july   which we may be required to purchase for cash from the holders as early as december  and to close our potential acquisition of sierra logic on or near september  we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credits 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to fiscal of approximately million 
the reduction in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of reduced net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital items in the consolidated balance sheet 
accounts and other receivables accounted for a million reduction in cash flows from operations 
the higher accounts and other receivables balance at july  resulted from the timing of revenue and collections 
inventories accounted for a million increase in cash flows from operations  primarily as a result of increased inventory purchases by our ems providers purchasing of raw materials directly  instead of us 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities accounted for a million reduction in cash flows from operations 
the lower accounts payable balance at july  was a result of changes in our inventory model and timing of the payments

the primary difference being the million repurchase of convertible subordinated notes in fiscal financing activities provided approximately million of cash and cash equivalents in fiscal this increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal compared to was primarily due to our net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes of approximately million offset by the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes spending approximately million and the repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity as of july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
as of july   we have approximately million face value convertible subordinated notes issued and outstanding 
the fair value  based on quoted market prices  of our convertible subordinated notes at july   was approximately million 
the fair value of these notes may increase or decrease due to various factors  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions
