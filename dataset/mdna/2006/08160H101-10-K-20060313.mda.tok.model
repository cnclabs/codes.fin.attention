the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
overview we are in the business of manufacturing electronics and provide our services to original equipment manufacturers oems of computers and related products for business enterprises  medical devices  industrial control equipment  testing and instrumentation products  and telecommunication equipment 
the services that we provide are commonly referred to as electronics manufacturing services ems 
we offer our customers comprehensive and integrated design and manufacturing services  from initial product design to volume production and direct order fulfillment 
we also provide specialized engineering services  including product design  printed circuit board layout  prototyping and test development 
we believe that we have developed strengths in the manufacturing process for large  complex  high density printed circuit boards as well as the ability to manufacture high and low volume products in lower cost regions such as brazil  china  mexico and thailand 
as our customers have continued to expand their globalization strategy during the past several years  we have continued to make the necessary changes to align our business operations with our customers demand 
these changes include  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
during  we will continue to expand our low cost capacity while realigning and further strengthening our global footprint to support continued business opportunities 
restructuring charges associated with these re alignment efforts  primarily related to the closure of our uk facility  are estimated to be in the range of million to million pre tax during the actual timing of such charges has yet to be determined  although it is expected that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of we believe that our global manufacturing presence of facilities in eight countries increases our ability to be responsive to our customers needs by providing accelerated time to market and time to volume production of high quality products 
these capabilities should enable us to build stronger strategic relationships with our customers and to become a more integral part of their operations 
our customers face challenges in planning  procuring and managing their inventories efficiently due to customer demand fluctuations  product design changes  short product life cycles and component price fluctuations 
we employ production management systems to manage their procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost effective manner so that  where possible  components arrive on a just in time  as and when needed basis 
we are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials  and can capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts  obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply  and return excess components 
our expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain enables us to reduce our customers cost of goods sold and inventory exposure 
we recognize revenue from the sale of circuit board assemblies  systems and excess inventory when the goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
to a lesser extent  revenue is also recognized from non manufacturing services  such as product design  circuit board layout  and test development 
service related revenues are recognized when the service is rendered and the costs related to these services are expensed as incurred 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment as we typically warrant workmanship only 
therefore our warranty provisions are insignificant 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our procurement of materials for production requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
revenue from each product that we manufacture includes the total of the costs of materials in that product and the cost of the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
our gross margin for any product depends on the sales price  the proportionate mix of the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically have the potential to realize higher gross margins on products where the proportionate level of labor and manufacturing overhead is greater than that of materials 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product and higher gross margins 
summary of results sales for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion for the same period of the increase in our sales reflects new program revenues from both existing and new customers 
sales to our largest customer  sun microsystems  inc  decreased to of our sales in from of our sales in during  the level of concentration among our top customers as a percentage of revenues decreased as revenues from our remaining customer base expanded 
sales to our two largest customers increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
sales to our customers  other than our two largest customers  increased to billion in from billion in  an increase of 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in because of the current market pricing trends  new program ramps and product transitions that have affected our margins during these activities continue to impact the level of efficiency in our production and negatively impacted our gross profit 
we do expect that a number of our new and higher volume programs with customers will remain subject to competitive constraints on the margin that may be realized from these programs  and  that these constraints could exert downward pressure on our margins in the near future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of the receivables 
to evaluate a specific customer s ability to pay  we analyze financial statements  payment history  third party credit analysis reports and various information or disclosures by the customer or other publicly available information 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory obsolescence reserve we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reserve for estimated obsolescence as necessary in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demands and market conditions 
we evaluate our inventory valuation on a quarterly basis based on current and forecasted usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
customers frequently make changes to their forecasts  requiring us to make changes to our inventory purchases  commitments  and production scheduling and may require us to cancel open purchase commitments with our vendors 
this process may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of our customer s revised needs  or parts that become obsolete before use in production 
we record inventory reserves on excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are established on inventory which we have determined that our customers are not responsible for or on inventory that we believe our customers are unable to fulfill their obligation to ultimately purchase such inventory from us 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
we are subject to examination by tax authorities for varying periods in various us and foreign taxing jurisdictions 
during the course of such examinations disputes occur as to matters of fact and or law 
also  in most taxing jurisdictions the passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting an examination of the tax period s for which such statute of limitation has expired 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our tax liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized by the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  by determining the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values  including goodwill  of the reporting unit 
as of december   we had net goodwill of approximately million 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage relationship that certain items in our consolidated statements of income bear to sales for the periods indicated 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses contract settlement restructuring charges income from operations other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for were billion  a increase from sales of billion in the increase of billion resulted from increased sales under new programs and increased activity with existing customers 
this increase included a million increase in printed circuit board assembly pcba sales volume and a million increase attributable to sales activity associated with new and existing systems integration customers 
a substantial percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers  and the loss of a major customer  if not replaced  would adversely affect us 
during  our two largest customers together represented of our sales  with one customer accounting for of our sales 
sales to our largest customer  sun microsystems  inc  decreased to of our sales in from of our sales in during  the level of concentration among our top customers as a percentage of revenues decreased as revenues from our remaining customer base expanded 
sales to our two largest customers increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
sales to our customers  other than our two largest customers  increased to billion in from billion in  an increase of 
our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products  or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services  could have an adverse effect on us 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our manufacturing and assembly operations include printed circuit boards and subsystem assembly  box build and systems integration 
systems integration is the process of integrating subsystem and printed circuit board assemblies and  often  downloading and integrating software  to produce a fully configured product 
systems integration is a value added service that is not separable from our overall contract manufacturing service 
sales from the operation of our systems integration facilities represented and of our sales for the years ended december  and we have manufacturing facilities in the americas  asia and europe to serve our customers 
we are operated and managed geographically 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the percentage of our sales by region for the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  americas asia europe our americas region includes facilities in angleton  texas  beaverton  oregon  campinas  brazil  guadalajara  mexico  hudson  new hampshire  huntsville  alabama  loveland  colorado  redmond  washington and winona  minnesota 
there are two facilities in huntsville  alabama a systems integration facility and a pcba facility 
the loveland and redmond facilities provide systems integration services 
in march  we closed our manassas  virginia pcba facility 
we opened a new pcba facility in rochester  minnesota in january our asia region includes facilities in ayudhaya and korat  thailand  singapore and suzhou  china 
the korat  thailand facility began operations in september there are two facilities in ayudhaya  thailand a systems integration facility that began operations in and a pcba facility we acquired in in the fourth quarter of  the singapore facility ceased systems integration operations 
currently  the singapore facility provides engineering and international purchasing services 
our europe region includes facilities in dublin  ireland and leicester  england 
the dublin facility provides systems integration services 
our leicester facility is scheduled to cease significant operations at the end of the first quarter of our international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
these dynamics have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations through december  however  we cannot assure you that there will not be an adverse impact in the future 
see item a for factors pertaining to our international sales and fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency and for further discussion of potential adverse effects in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
the increase in the percentage of international sales for as compared to primarily reflects the additional sales resulting from the operation of the facilities in thailand  including the thailand systems integration facility which began operations in august and the korat facility which began operations in september we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
backlog consists of purchase orders received  including  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
we believe the increase in backlog is attributable to the organic growth of our business 
although we expect to fill substantially all of our backlog during  at december   we did not have long term agreements with all of our customers and customer orders can be canceled  changed or delayed by customers 
the timely replacement of canceled  changed or delayed orders with orders from new customers cannot be assured  nor can there be any assurance that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
because of these factors  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
americas sales in the americas during increased million  or  compared to this net increase included a million increase in pcba sales volume attributable to sales under new programs and increased activity with existing customers and a million net increase in sales under new programs and increased activity with existing systems integration customers 
asia sales in asia during increased million  or  compared to this net increase included a million increase in pcba sales volume attributable to ramping new programs in asia and transferring existing customer business to asia 
this increase was offset by a million net decrease attributable to sales activity with existing systems integration customers 
in the third quarter of  the thailand systems integration facility began production 
in the fourth quarter of  the singapore facility ceased systems integration operations and currently provides engineering and international purchasing services 
europe sales in europe during decreased million  or  compared to the same period of this net decrease included a million decrease in sales volumes from systems integration customers  and a million net decrease in overall pcba sales volume 
the overall decrease in sales volume in europe is a result of lower demand for our customers products in europe and the transfer of production for some customers to lower cost production geographies 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales for and  respectively  decreased to from 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased because of the effect of current market pricing trends  new program ramps and product transitions during these activities combined to impact the level of efficiency in our production and negatively impacted our gross profit 
typically  a new program will contribute relatively less to our gross profit in its early stages  as manufacturing volumes are low and result in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs 
as volumes increase  the contribution to gross profit often increases due to the ability to leverage improved utilization rates and overhead absorption 
in addition  different programs can contribute different gross profits depending on factors such as the types of services involved  location of production  size of the program  complexity of the product  and level of material costs associated with the various products 
as a result  our gross profit varies from period to period 
the and gross profit includes charges credits related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
during and  million and million of additional reduced inventory reserves were recorded  respectively 
during and  favorable market conditions  improved demand by customers and financial statement positions among our customers contributed to decreased excess and obsolete inventory levels as previously reserved inventory was sold 
we expect that a number of our higher volume programs with customers will remain subject to competitive restraints on the margin that may be realized from these programs and that these restraints could exert downward pressure on our margins in the near future 
for the foreseeable future  our gross profit is expected to depend primarily on facility utilization  product mix  start up of new programs and pricing within the electronics industry 
the gross margins at each facility and for benchmark as a whole are expected to continue to fluctuate 
increases in start up costs associated with new programs and pricing within the electronics industry also could adversely impact our gross margin as they did during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  in and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily associated with the increase in sales 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million and million  respectively  in and the decrease is primarily due to lower fees associated with the three year million credit agreement entered into on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense income tax expense of million represented an effective tax rate of for the year ended december   compared with million at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher estimated income tax benefits for in foreign tax jurisdictions as compared to and net income tax benefits related to certain previously filed us tax returns 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income we reported net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings of per share for  compared with net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings of per share for the net increase of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales for were billion  an increase from sales of billion in the increase of million resulted from increased sales under new programs and increased activity with existing customers 
of this increase  million was attributable to the operation of our systems integration facilities and million to an overall increase in pcba sales volume 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million primarily due to decreased demand in europe which resulted in the consolidation and downsizing of certain manufacturing facilities 
sales from the operation of our systems integration facilities represented and of our sales for the years ended december  and our facilities in the americas provided and of net sales  respectively  during and we opened the loveland  colorado facility in may and the redmond  washington facility in october both the loveland and redmond facilities provide systems integration services 
our facilities in asia provided and of our net sales  respectively  during and in  our singapore facility included both a systems integration and pcba operation 
during  the pcba facility ceased operations 
during  the systems integration operation in singapore ceased operations 
our facilities in europe provided and of net sales  respectively  during and during the fourth quarter of  we closed our east kilbride  scotland facility 
during the second quarter of  we closed the cork  ireland facility 
both facilities were sold during during and  and  respectively  of our sales were from our international operations 
the increase in the percentage of international sales for as compared to primarily reflected the additional sales resulting from the operation of the facilities in thailand  including the korat facility which began operations in september we had a backlog of approximately billion at december   as compared to the year end backlog of billion 
americas sales in the americas during increased million  or  compared to this net increase included a million increase attributable to sales under new programs and increased activity with existing systems integration customers 
this increase was offset by a million net decrease in pcba sales volume attributable to the impact of maturing programs and new product introductions 
asia sales in asia during increased million  or  compared to this net increase included a million increase in pcba sales volumes attributable to ramping new programs in asia and transferring existing customer business to asia and a million decrease in sales volume from systems integration customers 
europe sales in europe during decreased million  or  compared to this net decrease included a million decrease in sales volumes from systems integration customers  a million decrease in pcba sales resulting from the closing of the east kilbride  scotland and cork  ireland facilities and an million net decrease in overall pcba sales volume 
the overall decrease in sales volume in europe during this time was a result of lower demand for our customers products in europe and the transfer of production for some customers to lower cost production geographies 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales for and decreased to from 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased because of new program ramps  new program introduction delays and a high level of mix changes during these activities combined to impact the level of efficiency in our production and negatively impacted our gross profit 
the and gross profit includes charges credits related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
during and  million and million of reduced additional inventory reserves were recorded  respectively 
during  favorable market conditions  improved demand by customers and financial statement positions among our customers contributed to decreased excess and obsolete inventory levels as previously reserved inventory was sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were and  respectively  in and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily associated with the increase in sales and also reflects the impact of facility consolidation and downsizing which occurred in the charge to operations for bad debt allowance declined to million during from million during as we had fewer customers with financial difficulties 
contract settlement during the first quarter of  we settled and released various claims arising out of customer manufacturing agreements 
in connection with the settlement of these claims  we recorded a non cash gain totaling million 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million and million  respectively  in and the decrease was primarily due to repayments of outstanding debt  and to the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes to common shares in september see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense income tax expense of million represented an effective tax rate of for the year ended december   compared with million at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the dissolution of an inactive foreign owned subsidiary during that resulted in an million foreign tax benefit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
net income we reported net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings of per share for  compared with net income of approximately million  or diluted earnings of per share for the net increase of million in was due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our growth and operations through funds generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of our securities and funds borrowed under our credit facilities 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  cash used in operating activities was million in the cash used in operations during consisted primarily of million of net income adjusted for million of depreciation and amortization  and a million increase in accounts payable  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories 
working capital was million at december  and million at december  our days sales outstanding of days and our inventory turns of times reflect the impact of the level of new program activities 
we expect increases in working capital to support the anticipated growth in sales 
we are continuing the practice of purchasing components only after customer orders are received  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk of loss on inventories 
supplies of electronic components and other materials used in operations are subject to industry wide shortages 
in certain instances  suppliers may allocate available quantities to us 
we did not experience shortages of electronic components and other material supplies during the reporting period 
if shortages of these components and other material supplies used in operations occur  vendors may not ship the quantities we need for production and we may be forced to delay shipments  which would increase backorders 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  capital expenditures of million were primarily concentrated in manufacturing production equipment in asia and the americas to support our ongoing business and to expand certain existing manufacturing operations and included million for the purchase of manufacturing and office facilities in minnesota that we previously leased 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  and paid million in debt issuance costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we have a million three year revolving credit line with a syndicate of commercial banks for general corporate purposes which can be increased to a total of million 
we are entitled to borrow under the revolving credit line up to million 
interest on the revolving credit line is payable quarterly  at our option  at either the bank s eurodollar rate plus to or its prime rate plus to  based upon our debt ratio as specified in the agreement 
a commitment fee of to per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly in arrears 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line and million was available for future borrowings 
the revolving credit facility is secured by our domestic inventory and accounts receivable  of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries  and of the voting capital stock of each direct foreign subsidiary and substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries other tangible and intangible assets 
the revolving credit facility contains customary financial covenants as to working capital  interest coverage  debt leverage  fixed charges  and consolidated net worth  and restricts our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  sell assets and to merge or consolidate with other persons without the consent of the banks 
at december   we were in compliance with all such restrictions 
our thailand subsidiary has a credit agreement with kasikornbank public company formerly thai farmers bank public company limited and bank of ayudhya public company limited the thai credit agreement 
the thai credit agreement provides that the lenders will make available to our thailand subsidiary up to approximately million in revolving loans  and machinery loans through september the thai credit agreement is secured by land  buildings and machinery in thailand 
in addition  the thai credit agreement provides for approximately million million thai baht in working capital availability in the form of working capital loans million thai baht and bank guarantees million thai baht 
as of december   our thailand subsidiary had no working capital borrowings outstanding 
our operations  and the operations of businesses we acquire  are subject to certain foreign  federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental  waste management  health and safety matters 
we believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements and we seek to ensure that newly acquired businesses comply or will comply substantially with applicable requirements 
to date the costs of compliance and workplace and environmental remediation have not been material to us 
however  material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new  modified or more stringent requirements in the future 
in addition  our past  current and future operations  and the operations of businesses we have or may acquire  may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public  or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental  waste management or health and safety concerns 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term investments totaling million and million available for borrowings under our revolving credit lines 
we believe that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be approximately million  principally for machinery and equipment to support our ongoing business around the globe  in addition to our planned expansion in asia  which we anticipate will be a new building facility in china 
management believes that our existing cash and short term investment balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next twelve months 
management further believes that our ongoing cash flows from operations and any borrowings we may incur under our credit facilities will enable us to meet operating cash requirements in future years 
should we desire to consummate significant acquisition opportunities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facility or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that extend out beyond under lease obligations 
non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing techniques other than traditional operating leases and we have not guaranteed the obligations of any entity that is not one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the total contractual cash obligations in existence at december  due pursuant to contractual commitments are payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our international sales are a significant portion of our net sales  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including the following foreign currency exchange risk  import and export duties  taxes and regulatory changes  inflationary economies or currencies  and economic and political instability 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our practice is to maintain a hedged position for certain significant transaction exposures 
these exposures are primarily  but not limited to  vendor payments and inter company balances in currencies other than the currency in which our foreign operation primarily generates and expends cash 
our international operations in some instances operate in a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in the future  significant transactions involving our international operations may cause us to consider engaging in hedging transactions to attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency hedges 
our sales are substantially denominated in us dollars 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in certain european countries and brazil 
we are also exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates  a portion of which relates to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place cash and cash equivalents and investments with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities 
at december   the outstanding amount in the short term investment portfolio was million of auction rate securities with an average return of
