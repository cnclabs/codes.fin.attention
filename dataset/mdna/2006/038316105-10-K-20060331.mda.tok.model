critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on expected or known trends or events  historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from software licensing and service fees is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
substantially all of the company s product license revenue is earned from the license of off the shelf software requiring no customization 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenue from software licensing when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists via a signed agreement or purchase order  delivery has occurred including authorization keys  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  delivered and undelivered products  support obligations  consulting  and training services  the company determines the amount of revenue to allocate to the licenses sold with services or maintenance using the residual method of accounting 
under the residual method  the company allocates the total value of the arrangement first to the undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and the remainder to the delivered element  the software license 
the company has determined fair value based upon prices it charges customers when these elements are sold separately 
maintenance contracts are generally sold with the initial licenses 
the related maintenance revenue is deferred based upon vsoe  which is determined by the renewal price of the annual maintenance contract  and is recognized ratably over the maintenance contract period 
the company recognizes consulting and training service revenues  including those sold with license fees  as the services are performed based upon their established vsoe 
in those instances in which indirect channel partners provide certain support services under the maintenance support contracts to the end user customer  the company accounts for amounts received in these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company must make certain judgments in these types of 
table of contents arrangements including whether the company or the indirect channel partner is the primary obligor in the arrangement with the end user customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon analysis of aged accounts receivable  historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for accounts that management believes may not be collected due to a customer s financial circumstance eg bankruptcy  and for those accounts that have aged over days past due  for which there is a lack of evidence that supports their collectibility 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or the company s overdue receivables balance were to increase significantly  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets and related impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors including legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of its acquired businesses to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
if events change and the company has overestimated the economic life of its intangible asset  the company will begin to amortize the remaining unamortized carrying value of this asset over the newly estimated life  which may result in additional amortization expense 
restructuring during and  the company recorded charges in connection with its restructuring programs 
these charges include estimates pertaining to the settlements of contractual obligations  including the restructuring of its uk office and westborough  ma headquarters leases 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates  which would result in incremental charges or credits to the income statement and have cash flow ramifications 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  the company s us deferred tax assets were fully reserved 
in the event the company were to determine in the future that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company has provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made

table of contents that cost over the period that such services are performed 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
adoption of sfas r will materially increase our stock compensation expense and decrease our net income and basic and diluted earnings per share

this position amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  in particular the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
most of the company s international sales through its subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies 
although foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years  the company s exposure to changes in net income  due to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations  in the company s foreign subsidiaries is mitigated to some extent by expenses incurred by the foreign subsidiary in the same currency 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures relate to its short term intercompany balances with its foreign subsidiaries  primarily the australian dollar 
the company s foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the euro  australian dollar  british pound and swiss franc 
intercompany transactions denominated in these currencies are remeasured at each period end with any exchange gains or losses recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
during  the company reported a net loss on foreign exchange of approximately  in its consolidated financial statements of operations  primarily due to unfavorable movements in the australian dollar exchange rate 
based on foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates related to the british pound  euro  australian dollar  and swiss franc would result in an approximately  reduction to earnings 
the company has currently not engaged in activities to hedge these exposures 
at december   the company held  in cash and cash equivalents  excluding  of restricted cash  consisting primarily of money market funds  and  in short term investments 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
short term investments are classified as available for sale and carried at amortized cost  which approximates their fair value 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity and the company s intention that all the securities will be sold within one year
