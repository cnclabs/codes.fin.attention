the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide us with information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit plans may change significantly from year to year

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
