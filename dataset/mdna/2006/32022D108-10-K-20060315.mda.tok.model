item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital 
the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the corporation and first federal are classified as well capitalized 
fdicia also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within these five categories  with progressively more severe restrictions on operations  management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed 
failure to meet capital requirements can also cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital 
fdicia also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the fdic have each adopted risk based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
the agencies also jointly adopted a regulation  effective january   amending their regulatory capital standards to change the treatment of certain recourse obligations  direct credit subsidies  residual interest and other positions in securitized transactions that expose banking organizations to credit risk 
the regulation amends the agencies regulatory capital standards to align more closely the risk based capital treatment of recourse obligations and direct credit subsidies  to vary the capital requirements for positions in securitized transactions and certain other credit exposures according to their relative risk  and to require capital commensurate with the risks associated with residual interests 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines can subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and under some conditions the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
deposit insurance 
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to the statutory maximum limit of  per depositor through the savings association insurance fund 
for this protection  we must pay semiannual assessments to the fdic 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic  which will be determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
dividends 
the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the majority of our revenue is from dividends paid to it by the bank 
the bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends they can pay 
if  in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency  an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  the agency may require  after notice and hearing  that the institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under fdicia  an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
moreover  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
under kentucky law  dividends by kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits 
before any dividend may be declared for any period other than with respect to preferred stock  a bank must increase its capital surplus by at least of the net profits of the bank for the period until the bank s capital surplus equals the amount of its stated capital attributable to its common stock 
moreover  the kofi commissioner must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt 
we are also subject to the kentucky business corporation act  which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or if becoming unable to pay debts as they come due 
consumer protection laws 
we are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population 
these laws include the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the truth in lending act  the home mortgage disclosure act  and the real estate settlement procedures act  and state law counterparts 
federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protections provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
these provisions also provide that  except for certain limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
federal law makes it a criminal offense  except in limited circumstances  to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 
the community reinvestment act cra requires the fdic to assess our record in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve  including low and moderate income neighborhoods and persons 
the fdic s assessment of our record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve board s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office or to relocate an office 
the federal reserve board will also assess the cra record of the subsidiary banks of a bank holding company in connection with an application to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
bank secrecy act 
the bank secrecy act of bsa was enacted to deter money laundering  establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions and improve detection and investigation of criminal  tax and other regulatory violations 
bsa and subsequent laws and regulations require us to take steps to prevent the use of the bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money  including  without limitation  ensuring effective management oversight  establishing sound policies and procedures  developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities  ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of bsa compliance activities 
in recent years  federal regulators have increased the attention paid to compliance with the provisions of bsa and related laws  with particular attention paid to know your customer practices 
banks have been encouraged by regulators to enhance their identification procedures prior to accepting new customers in order to deter criminal elements from using the banking system to move and hide illegal and illicit activities 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act contains anti money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions 
the patriot act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism  including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  and grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions operations 
in addition  the patriot act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions

risk factors we  like other financial companies  are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside of management s control  though we strive to manage those risks while optimizing returns 
these risks include a credit risk  which is the risk that loan and lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations  b market risk  which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation  c liquidity risk  which is the risk that we will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet our operating needs  and d operational risk  which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems  or from external events 
in addition to the other information included readers should consider that the following important factors  among others  could materially impact our business  future results of operations  and future cash flows 
a credit risk we extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and the judgment of management 
we manage the credit risk it takes through a program of underwriting standards that we follow  the review of certain credit decisions  and an on going process of assessment of the quality of the credit we have already extended 
if our credit standards and our on going process of credit assessment do not function as intended  we could incur significant credit losses 
our loans and deposits are focused in central kentucky 
adverse economic conditions in that region  in particular  could harm our results from operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
adverse economic conditions and other factors  such as political or business development or natural hazards that may affect kentucky  may reduce demand for credit or fee based products and could negatively affect real estate and other collateral values  interest rate levels  and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or before maturity 
b market risk changes in interest rates could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  and money supply may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities in a given period  as a result of decreasing interest rates  our net interest income may decrease 
likewise  our net interest income may decrease if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interests rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates  which could reduce net interest income and harm our results of operations 
c liquidity risk if we cannot borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation to fund corporate expansion or other activities 
liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors  with operating limits set by the asset liability committee alco  based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  the percentage of assets funded with non core or wholesale funding 
alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the bank and holding company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
if our liquidity policies and strategies don t work as well as intended  then we may be unable to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
the alco establishes board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank fhlb advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other available sources of liquidity  including the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might be unable to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
d operational risk we have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans 
competition is intense in most of the markets we serve 
we compete on price and service with other banks and financial companies such as savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage banking companies  and brokerage firms 
competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation  the increasing availability of products and services from non banks  greater technological developments in the industry  and banking reform 
if our competition prices deposits or loans at rates significantly more favorable than ours  then we may have difficulty in both attracting and retaining deposits and loans 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk  which could cause us to incur substantial losses 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
from time to time  we experience loss from operational risk  including the effects of operational errors  and these losses may be substantial 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
new  or changes in existing tax  accounting  are regulatory laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s shareholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading regulation 
these regulations  along with currently existing tax  accounting  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy of us companies  can cause legislators  regulators  and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the public company accounting oversight board  and other various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
changes in regulation may cause us to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance  which may negatively affect our operating results

this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview we conduct operations in full service banking centers in six contiguous counties in kentucky along the interstate corridor 
our market presence ranges from the major metropolitan market of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of our headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to hart county  kentucky  approximately miles south of elizabethtown 
our core markets have experienced a compound annual growth rate of in deposits for the past four years 
we anticipate a similar growth rate of our markets for the next few years and believe we are well positioned to benefit from this continued growth 
our emphasis over the past several years has been focused on the enhancement and expansion of our retail and commercial banking network in our core markets as well as establishing our presence in the metro louisville market 
our five county core markets  where we have a combined market share  has become increasingly competitive with several new bank branches entering our markets in the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we enhanced several of our new facilities and anticipate several new facilities over the next few years 
in addition to the enhancement and expansion in our core markets  we began establishing our presence in the metro louisville market 
the metro louisville market of jefferson county is contiguous to our five county core markets 
approximately of the deposit base in the metro louisville market is controlled by six out of state banks 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with a much more empowered staff of associates 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to world class customer service will enhance our existing market share and effectively support our development in the metro louisville market 
the enhancement of our retail branch network continues to produce positive results for total deposits have grown at a compound annual growth rate over the past four years 
total deposits were million at december   an increase of million from december  we achieved this growth despite a million decrease in public funds deposits as one of our county school district customers constructed three new schools during the year 
for  total retail and commercial deposits grew million the development of the retail branch network into the metro louisville market has also generated positive results 
we have a combined million in deposits in our two new full service facilities in the metro louisville market representing a increase in deposits for the year 
we opened these new facilities in the second quarter of to support our growing commercial customer base in this market 
twenty one percent of the loans in our portfolio are located in our metro louisville market 
we also have been significantly investing in our branch network outside of the louisville metropolitan market  where we have a commanding deposit market share 
we have renovated several of our existing branches and have under construction a new full service banking center in hardin county opening in early the design of the new and enhanced facilities represents our state of the art prototype branch with a retail focused design  complimenting our commitment to providing world class customer service 
while we anticipate these facilities will significantly enhance the value of our franchise in the near future  the additional expense in operating these new facilities will continue to place pressure on earnings 
we estimate new branch facilities will reach break even in approximately to months 
we are optimistic that the growth in deposits and loans generated as a result of our expansion strategy will minimize this period and the long term benefits will ultimately outweigh the initial investment costs 
our emphasis on commercial lending generated a compound annual growth rate in the total loan portfolio and a compound annual growth rate in commercial loans over the past four years 
commercial loans were million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  the growth in our commercial loan portfolio  coupled with the rising interest rate environment  has increased interest income 
net interest margin increased to for the year ended december   compared to a year ago 
this has resulted in a million increase in net interest income to million for  compared to the increasing interest rate environment improved net interest margin due to the growth in the adjustable rate commercial loans coupled with the decrease in residential fixed rate loans in the loan portfolio 
net interest margin has been favorably impacted since the federal open market committee began increasing short term interest rates in june we believe the federal open market committee will stop increasing short term interest rates during and will likely decrease short term interest rates in late or into our net interest margin and the level of net interest income will be negatively affected with a decrease in short term interest rates over the next several quarters 
we continually monitor the effects rate changes will have on our level of net interest income and management works to structure the maturity and pricing of loans and deposits to mitigate large swings in net interest income 
during  we made efforts to increase the level of short term deposits with a money market promotion as well as offering more attractive rates on short term certificates of deposit relative to long term maturities 
in addition  of the newly originated or renewed loans during were fixed rates loans with the interest rate fixed from three to five years 
these efforts  in addition to other initiatives to structure funding and future liquidity needs will help decrease the negative impact flat or decreasing short term interest rates may have on the level of net interest income 
more detailed information on the effects of changing interest rates on our level of interest income can be found in the asset liability management and market risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our asset quality remains favorable 
net charge offs as a percent of total loans was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period a year ago 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans  increased to at december  compared to at december  the percentage of non performing loans to total loans increased to at december   compared to at december  provision for loan loss expense decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million a year ago 
the decrease in the provision for the year was related to a decrease in net charge offs of  to  for the year ended december  compared to  the prior year 
non interest income decreased  to million  while non interest expense increased million to million for  compared to the primary contributing factors to this increase were the additional operating and employee compensation expenses related to the recent expansion efforts 
twenty four retail staff positions were added for the expansion into the louisville metropolitan market  coupled with expanded facilities in hardin county and bullitt county  kentucky 
additional increases in staff have taken place during and to continue the transformation towards a stronger retail sales culture and to provide expanded products and services to our retail and commercial customers 
non interest expense levels are often measured using an efficiency ratio non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non interest income 
our efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio and the executive loan committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses  in part  based on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our strategic plan to increase our emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million during if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially affected 
results of operations net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in provision for loan loss expense of  our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase in diluted earnings per share was due to a stock repurchase of  shares of our own common stock  which decreased capital by million 
the decrease in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in non interest expense of million for the period compared to  the direct result of our expansion efforts 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
we reported net income of million during the year ended december  compared with million for the period 
diluted earnings per share increased from during to for earnings remained relatively constant for the comparative periods 
favorable increases in non interest income generated from the gain on sale of mortgage loans  service charges on deposit accounts  and two lots held for sale were offset by a decline in net interest income as well as an increase in non interest expense 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated return on average assets of and return on average equity of 
these compare with return on average assets of and return on average equity of for the period 
net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as market interest rates 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets increased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the period 
the increasing interest rate environment in conjunction with an increase in average earning assets improved net interest margin for the periods presented 
average interest earning assets increased million for the period compared to the yield on earning assets averaged for the period compared to an average yield on earning assets of for the same period in the prime lending rate increased basis points from the time the federal open market committee began increasing short term interest rates in june through the end of our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in deposit costs have accelerated due to the re pricing of certificate of deposit maturities rolling off at lower rates into current higher interest rates in addition to our higher rates paid on our money market products 
going forward  our cost of funds is expected to increase as the general market deposit rates have become increasingly competitive with the recent upward trend in interest rates 
net interest margin has been favorably impacted since the federal open market committee began increasing short term interest rates in june we believe the federal open market committee will stop increasing short term interest rates during  and will likely decrease short term interest rates in late or into our net interest margin and the level of net interest income will be negatively affected with a decrease in short term interest rates 
we continually monitor the effects rate changes will have on our level of net interest income and management works to structure the maturity and pricing of loans and deposits to mitigate large swings in net interest income

change change dollars in thousands non interest income customer sevice fees on deposit accounts gain on sale of mortgage loans gain on sale of investments gain on sale of real estate held for development brokerage commissions other income growth in customer service fees on deposit accounts  our largest component of non interest income  is primarily due to growth in customer deposits  overdraft fee income on retail checking accounts and the sale of fee based products for both and we continue to increase our customer base through cross selling opportunities and marketing initiatives and promotions 
we undertook a renewed emphasis on growing our checking account base during to better enhance our profitability and franchise value and will continue this emphasis going forward 
this initiative initially began in late with the introduction of new checking account products and or significant enhancements to existing products 
we also introduced two new checking account products in geared toward customers on check systems who would not normally qualify for a standard checking account 
we expect the increase in checking accounts we experienced in to continue going forward 
this will positively impact our level of customer service fees on deposit accounts 
through our mortgage banking subsidiary  first heartland mortgage company  we originate qualified va  khc  rhc and conventional secondary market loans and sell them into the secondary market with servicing rights released 
for  gain on sale of mortgage loans remained steady compared to however  due to a decline in refinancing activity of family loans  gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased for the period compared to we expect the gain on sale of mortgage loans to remain consistent with the levels reached in and we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others 
during the first quarter of we recorded a gain on sale of investments of  for  gain on sale of investments includes various other sales of equity investments 
gains on investment securities are infrequent in nature and are not a consistent recurring source of income

twenty four retail staff positions were added for the expansion into the louisville metropolitan market  coupled with expanded facilities in hardin county and bullitt county  kentucky 
additional increases in staff have taken place during  and to continue the transformation towards a stronger retail sales culture and to provide expanded products and services to our retail and commercial customers 
we look for a continued increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in line with recent trends  as we progress with our retail expansion and market protection efforts 
office occupancy expense and equipment  marketing and advertising  and outside services and data processing increased due to additional operating expenses related to our expansion efforts for  and the two full service branch openings in contributed to higher operating costs including additional postage for promotions and direct mailings for marketing  along with increased communications and supplies expense 
we look for a continuation of these trends as we continue our retail expansion and market protection efforts 
bank franchise tax expense increased  in from due to a higher tax expense accrual resulting from the conversion from a federally chartered thrift to a kentucky state chartered commercial bank 
the state tax expense for a bank charter is calculated based upon different rules 
we anticipate the increased level of non interest expense to continue into with continued retail expansion and market share protection efforts 
we started construction on a new full service banking center in elizabethtown  ky with plans of opening in early we will begin construction on a third facility in jefferson county to begin in the first quarter of with the anticipation of opening in early we are also considering other possible locations within the core market area to protect and grow our market share

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the allowance is determined based on the application of loss estimates to graded loans by categories 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is also based upon an analysis of such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our strategic plan to increase our emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
the indirect consumer loan program is comprised of new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicle loans originated on our behalf by a select group of auto dealers within the our service area 
the indirect loan program involves a greater degree of risk and is evaluated quarterly and monitored by the board of directors 
in light of the greater charge offs from indirect consumer loans compared to direct consumer loans  proportionally more of the allowance for consumer loans is allocated for indirect loans than direct loans 
as the indirect loan program has evolved  dealer analysis and underwriting standards have been refined to improve the loan loss experience of the program 
estimating the allowance is a continuous process 
in this regard  the allowance for loan loss review committee continues to monitor the performance of indirect consumer loans as well as our other loan products and updates estimates as the evidence warrants

the provision for loan losses remained constant at million for the year ended december   compared to the period 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  to million or of total loans for december  compared to of total loans for december  the increased allowance was primarily due to increases in commercial loans during the period 
net loan charge offs increased  to  during compared to  during  due to an increase in commercial loan net charge offs 
the provision for loan losses decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the period 
the higher provision expense for was due to a change in loan types 
the total allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december  to december  we increased the allowance for loan losses due to the continued strong growth in commercial real estate lending and changes in the product mix within the loan portfolios 
net loan charge offs decreased  to  during compared to  during the decrease in charge offs is primarily related to a decrease in charge offs of indirect consumer loans during the period 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance funding and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  we had million of assets classified substandard   classified as doubtful  and  of assets classified as loss 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  we had million assets classified substandard  million classified as doubtful  and  of assets classified as loss 
the million increase in substandard assets for december  was primarily the result of two credit relationships 
these credit relationships were a million commercial real estate relationship and a  commercial relationship 
both relationships were classified as substandard in september of loans are classified according to estimated loss as follows substandard to  doubtful to  and loss 
we additionally provide an allowance estimate for probable incurred losses in non classified loans ranging from 
to 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans under sfas  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed of 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of legal counsel 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinued  existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense

the restructured loans primarily consist of three credit relationships aggregating million  including a million commercial relationship  a  commercial relationship and a  residential mortgage relationship 
the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest and extend the term thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the terms of the restructured loans are currently being met

investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities

the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios increased by million or during the period due to investments in us agencies  mortgage backed securities  state and municipal obligations and a corporate bond 
we purchased the short term us agency and mortgage backed securities as a source of liquidity for funding future loan growth 
the corporate bond re prices quarterly with three month libor and was purchased to enhance our earnings 
the state and municipal obligations have an average life of years 
we purchased these securities to enhance earnings and manage interest rate risk by placing longer dated assets on the balance sheet

deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years we have been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of their use on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
we rely primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network we have undertaken a renewed emphasis on growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value  as well as lower our dependence on certificate of deposit funding 
a heightened level of advertising and promotions coupled with associate incentive plans designed to encourage the sale of checking account were successful in attracting deposits during we plan to continue these efforts during and anticipate continued progress 
the combination of our long standing relationships in addition to promotions of money market and checking account products enabled us to increase total deposits by million at december   compared to the period 
we were able to achieve this increase despite the decrease of million in public funds deposits during the year 
total retail and commercial deposits increased million during the year  offsetting the decrease in public funds 
checking balances grew million  or at december   compared to december  money market and savings deposits grew million  or for december   compared to the period and certificates of deposit grew million  or for december   compared to december  the decrease in public funds was the result of one of our county school district customers using the deposits to construct three new schools during the year 
the deposit growth in our louisville metropolitan market was across all deposit categories 
checking deposit balances increased  savings and money market balances increased  and certificate of deposit balances increased 
to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin as interest rates increase and the economy recovers 
we offer statement and passbook savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by management on a periodic basis 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms and interest rates 
these certificates have minimum deposit requirements as well 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  our ability to attract and maintain deposits and its cost of funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions 
as of december   the holders of our certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more were million in non brokered deposits  most of who reside within our service areas 
certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more obtained from deposit brokers were  for the period

advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
we also had million in federal funds purchased from the fhlb at december  the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain standards related to creditworthiness

the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  are met  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity risk management also includes ensuring cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reviewed by the asset liability committee 
funds are available from a number of sources  including the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal pay downs on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
at december   we had brokered deposits totaling  we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from two of our correspondent banks totaling million each 
our banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  we have also utilized borrowings from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had an unused approved line of credit in the amount of million and sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future

these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
some of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert these advances to variable rates or we can prepay the advance at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advance before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe these advances will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature march   are redeemable prior to the maturity date at our option on or after march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture 
the interest rate on our subordinated debentures adjusts quarterly at three month libor plus 
these debt instruments are currently being issued as spreads to three month libor which are more favorable than our spread 
if this pricing continues through march   we will likely exercise our option to redeem these subordinated debentures on or after march  we have the option to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
we have an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management polices 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effects of movements in interest rates of both and basis points over a twelve month period 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at both december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  we are in an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  as short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will also increase 
likewise  as short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease 
the federal open market committee began increasing short term interest rates in june we believe the federal open market committee will stop increasing short term interest rates during and will likely decrease short term interest rates in late or into our net interest margin and the level of net interest income would be negatively affected with a decrease in short term interest rates 
we continually monitor the effects rate changes will have on our level of net interest income and management works to structure the maturity and pricing of loans and deposits to mitigate large swings in net interest income 
during  we made efforts to increase the level of short term deposits with a money market promotion as well as offering more attractive rates on short term certificates of deposit 
in addition  of the newly originated or renewed loans during were fixed rates loans with the interest rate fixed from three to five years 
these efforts  in addition to other initiatives to structure funding and future liquidity needs will decrease our asset sensitivity 
this will help decrease the negative impact flat or decreasing short term interest rates may have on the level of net interest income 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base
