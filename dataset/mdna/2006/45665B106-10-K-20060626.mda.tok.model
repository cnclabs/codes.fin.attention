item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in september  we announced a comprehensive restructuring plan with the goal of simplifying the business and returning the company to profitability 
as part of the restructuring  we implemented actions to reduce our cost to serve customers  improve our supply chain efficiency to reduce our product costs  and reduce our operating expenses 
our goal as a result of these actions is to improve gross margins to to and reduce our operating expenses to a level that will allow us to achieve breakeven or better results in our most seasonally challenged quarters 
as of the date of this report  our current expectation is that revenues for the second quarter of will be down from first quarter revenues of million due to later than expected volume shipments of our new commercial products and weaker than planned sales of our new entry level consumer product  the in  especially through the retail channel in both the us and europe 
lower than anticipated revenues will also subdue gross margin improvement for the second quarter of as fixed costs become a higher percentage of total cost of revenues 
as a result  we now do not expect to achieve operating profitability in our core business for the second quarter of we made significant progress on our restructuring activities late in as reflected in our improving operating expenses and gross margins in the later quarters of we finished with million in cash and marketable securities with no outstanding borrowings  up million from the end of in addition  inventory levels declined to million at the end of compared to million at the end of  reflecting continued improvements in our supply chain efficiency 
our financial results include a number of unusual or non recurring charges as summarized by the following and more fully described below a million charge for inventory and equipment write downs  included as a component of cost of revenues  an million charge related to restructuring actions  recorded as a separate component of operating expenses  a million charge related to long lived asset impairments  recorded as a separate component of operating expenses  and a million charge for estimated regulatory assessments  recorded as a separate component of operating expenses 
we recorded additional restructuring charges in relation to the restructuring plan in the first quarter of totaling approximately million  primarily related to international facility consolidation activities 
k filing and audit committee investigations on march  we announced a delay in filing our annual report on form k to allow for the completion of internal investigations initiated by our audit committee and completion of related audit procedures by our registered independent auditors 
in july  we self disclosed possible infractions of us export law to the office of foreign assets control ofac related to shipments into restricted countries by one of our foreign subsidiaries 
our audit committee commenced an investigation and engaged independent counsel to assist with this process 
the results of the independent investigation were submitted to ofac and the bureau of industry and security bis in march for their review 
upon completion of the investigation  it was apparent that the severity of the situation was significantly less than initially thought 
in june  ofac notified us that it was closing the matter by issuing a cautionary letter in lieu of any further enforcement action 
bis is currently in the process of conducting their review of our findings 
we originally accrued an estimated charge of million for potential regulatory assessments during the second quarter of and will make adjustments as needed upon completion of the bis review and final resolution of this matter 
in february  as part of the document review related to the ofac investigation  written communications were reviewed that raised potential concerns regarding the effectiveness of our financial controls and policies regarding revenue recognition 
after consultation with our registered independent auditors  our audit committee commenced an investigation and engaged independent counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation into this matter 
in june  after an extensive document review and interviewing relevant current and former employees  independent counsel issued a report to the audit committee concluding that we employ sound and appropriate revenue recognition practices and procedures 
the investigation did not identify any situation that would require restatement of financial statements for any prior periods nor any material weaknesses in internal controls 
after reviewing the report  our audit committee adopted these findings and closed the investigation 
in january  we received an unsubstantiated anonymous communication alleging that certain persons employed by our chinese subsidiary had engaged in improper business practices 
again  after consultation with our registered independent auditors  our audit committee commenced an investigation and engaged independent counsel to assist with the investigation into this matter 
in june  after an extensive document review and interviewing relevant current and former employees  independent counsel issued a report to the audit committee concluding that their was no basis for these allegations 
the investigation did not identify any situation that would require restatement of financial statements of any prior periods nor any material weaknesses in internal controls 
after reviewing the report  our audit committee adopted these findings and closed the investigation 
on march   we received a staff determination notice from the nasdaq stock market stating that we were not in compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule c because we had not yet filed our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  in april  we participated in an oral hearing with a nasdaq listing qualifications panel in which we presented our plan for filing both the form k and our form q for the quarterly period ended march  on april   we received notice that the panel determined to continue the listing of our shares on the nasdaq national market  subject to certain conditions  including the filing of the form k on or before july  and the filing of the form q on or before july  in addition  we negotiated an extension for providing wells fargo foothill with audited financial statements for fiscal year the extension was to july  and allowed us to maintain compliance with our line of credit agreement 
results of operations year ended december  dollars in thousands dollars of revenues dollars of revenues dollars of revenues revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets regulatory assessments loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income other  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss percentages may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues decreased million  or  in compared to as compared to an increase of million  or  in compared to approximately half of the decrease in revenues in compared to was due to transitioning our rear screen projection television engine business to smt during the year 
another factor contributing to the decline in projector revenues in as compared to was the impact of our decision to deemphasize our oem projector business in as we formed smt 
in addition  projector revenues were down in compared to due to average sales price asp declines and a decline in unit shipments 
specifically average sales prices declined in compared to and projector unit shipments were down in compared to the decrease in asps was primarily due to increased pricing pressure from our asian competitors fueled in part by excess inventory available across the industry and in all geographic locations in the first half of our asps remained relatively flat in the second half of  due to our efforts to improve gross margins by focusing on core markets and geographies and not pursuing unprofitable business 
the decline in projector unit shipments was primarily due to the intentional de emphasis on our oem projector business 
revenues from lamps and accessories increased in compared to when revenues were hampered by an industry wide shortage of lamps 
the increase in revenues for compared to was due primarily to a increase in projector units sold 
the increase in revenue due to the increase in projector units sold was partially offset by a decrease in projector asps in compared to the decline in asps of during compared to was primarily due to the continued pressure on pricing related to the ongoing competitive nature of the projection industry 
in addition to growth in projector revenues  we grew revenues in from increased sales of rear screen projection television engines and increased royalty revenues 
geographic revenues revenue by geographic area and as a percentage of total revenue was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  united states europe asia other united states revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to management decisions to not participate in certain sales opportunities due to the overly aggressive pricing competition related to competitor price buy in deals and lower revenues related to transitioning our rear projection engine business to smt 
european revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to economic softness in certain key markets as well as specific industry softness in the european region 
in addition  we experienced declines in our ask branded business and our strategic decision to transition the majority of our projector oem business to smt has negatively affected european revenues as this region s revenue base historically has benefited from oem customers 
asian revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a strategic decision not to grow this region until we had china manufacturing facilities up and running 
increased volume of a broader line up of projectors produced by smt and foxconn is expected to allow us to begin to compete more effectively in the china region moving forward 
in addition  the china market was very slow for us in the second half of as we worked to restructure our sales and distributor relationships to take advantage of our growing ability to sell locally procured products in the china market 
us revenues increased in compared to  reflecting improvements in the economy stimulating demand for projectors  growth of our rear projection television engine revenues  and increased royalty revenues 
european revenues increased in compared to  reflecting an improving euro region economy and positive effects from our european restructuring and marketing efforts 
asian revenues decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of our limited ability to sell in the china market until our china customs investigation is fully resolved 
in addition  included a  unit order from the malaysian government compared to a  unit order for backlog at december   we had backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  the stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders 
gross margin we achieved gross margins of in  in and in the decline in gross margins in compared to was due to the following asp declines discussed above combined with other end user price promotions and programs  a million charge for inventory write downs and accelerated tooling depreciation during compared to million in settlement of our m patent infringement case during the second quarter of  minimal product cost reductions as we reduced the volume of procurement from our contract manufacturers and  to a large extent  sold inventory that was purchased in prior quarters  and fixed overhead costs for activities such as logistics centers  warranty  tooling amortization and inventory planning and procurement were a higher percentage than normal as a result of lower revenues 
the charge for inventory write downs in was primarily related to our exit from the thin display business  lower of cost or market write downs on certain remanufactured projectors  service parts and slow moving finished goods inventory  and our transition away from flextronics 
of the million of inventory and equipment write downs in  million was recorded in the third quarter and included million related to the write down of inventory and accelerated tooling depreciation associated with the discontinuance of our thin display products  million for excess component exposures related to our transition from flextronics as a contract manufacturer  and million related to the write down of certain other remanufactured projectors  service parts and slow moving finished goods inventory 
the inventory write downs in related primarily to end of life costs for various product platforms  a decline in market value of the inventory held by customs in china and inventory processing transition issues associated with the movement of our us logistics and factory repair activity to ups 
the inventory write downs reduced our gross margin by percentage points in compared to percentage points in the increase in gross margins in compared to was due to the following release of several new product platforms for both the commercial and consumer markets during the first half of  resulting in a new product line up that had a greater price performance value for our customers relative to our production cost  a growing royalty revenue stream related to our patent portfolio  lower warranty costs due to improving product quality  higher reclaim of defective materials and improved throughput of repairs at ups  lower freight costs due to utilizing more ocean freight in compared to more air freight during  lower depreciation expense in compared to  primarily due to the long lived asset impairment charge we took in the third quarter of  and million of inventory write downs in compared to million in while we anticipate gross margins will remain under pressure in  we anticipate returning to gross margins of between and as we introduce several new products for both the commercial and consumer markets 
where gross margins end up in any particular quarter depends primarily on revenue levels  product mix  the competitive pricing environment and the level of warranty costs and inventory write downs during the particular quarter 
our gross margins also are impacted by the level of royalty revenues we record in any period as royalty revenues have little to no related costs 
we continue to focus on improving our supply chain efficiencies in order to reduce our product costs 
specifically  we are working on the following actions working closely with our contract manufacturers to control product costs  improving supply chain efficiencies by reducing product freight  handling and storage costs  managing inventory levels down further in order to increase operating inventory turns and improve cash flow  and focusing on lower cost  higher performance products 
marketing and sales expense marketing and sales expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and decreased million  or in from million in the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to was primarily due to decreased marketing program expenses related to lower revenues and changes to programs offered in as compared to some marketing programs  such as cooperative advertising  directly correlate with trends in revenue 
when revenues are lower  the related marketing program expenses are also reduced 
in addition  some marketing dollars spent on cooperative advertising programs relate to specific product promotions and are classified accordingly as a reduction of revenues and a larger part of these expenses were classified as a reduction of revenues  versus advertising expense  in as compared to in addition  the amount of administrative expense allocated to sales and marketing was lower in as compared to as total it and facilities expenses decreased year over year 
overall spending in sales and marketing was reduced in as compared to related to conscious cost cutting initiatives 
one of the major components of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives is to reduce our cost to serve customers 
accordingly  we have implemented or are implementing the following actions focusing our sales and marketing activities on selected geographies in our international regions  enabling us to reduce our sales and marketing investment in these regions while improving focus in an attempt to grow our largest and most profitable revenue streams 
in europe  our focus will be the european union  with priority given to larger markets such as the united kingdom  france  germany and the nordics 
in asia  our focus will be larger markets such as singapore  australia  india and china  in the americas  we are concentrating our sales and marketing efforts on our most profitable channels and maximizing efficiencies in the highest growth channels 
we anticipate continued strong results from the retail sector  pc distribution and our direct fulfilled business  and we consolidated our worldwide marketing efforts under our chief marketing officer 
this worldwide consolidation resulted in synergies among previously dispersed marketing resources 
we plan to reinvest a portion of these savings to create highly targeted demand generation in our key channels and to strengthen the range and reach of the infocus brand 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from efficiencies related to our restructuring actions taken during and lower depreciation expense due to the long lived asset impairment charge taken in the third quarter of these decreases were partially offset by sales and marketing activities surrounding demand generation programs for our products and the launch of our ultra thin microdisplay business 
the decrease was also partially offset by an increase in allocation of shared service expenses to marketing and sales expense 
our cost structure in no longer included in house manufacturing or logistics  increasing the amount of shared service expense allocated to operating expenses versus cost of goods sold 
research and development expense research and development expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and decreased million  or in from million in the reduction in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to expected reductions related to the formation of smt and the closure of our remaining research and development facilities in norway 
these reductions include lower labor expense  travel  consulting and non recurring engineering expenses related to product design 
in addition  the amount of administrative expenses allocated to research and development was lower in as compared to as overall it and facilities expenses were reduced 
partially offsetting these decreases were slight increases in consulting expenses related to third party engineering services provided in as our engineering staff was reduced 
the decrease in compared to was primarily related to the increase in our co development efforts with our manufacturing partners  reimbursement from our customer partners related to engine prototype development  overall lower prototype expenses and lower depreciation expense due to the long lived asset impairment charge taken in the third quarter of in addition  in  we recognized a million reduction in expense related to repayment of non recurring engineering expenses by one of our customers upon contract termination compared to none in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in allocation of shared service expenses to research and development expense 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  and decreased million  or in from million in the decrease in compared to was related to a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the reduction in bad debt expense year over year was primarily related to the recovery in of bad debt expense booked in previous periods 
we also recognized decreases in labor costs and rent expense related to our and restructuring actions 
these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on new patents and trademarks  increased legal expenses related to various legal matters including the m patent infringement suit  the china customs and ofac investigations  and increased expense related to accelerated depreciation on assets that were located at our norway facility that was shut down in the first quarter of the reduction in general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense due to the long lived asset impairment charge we took in the third quarter of  efficiencies gained as a result of our restructuring activities during and and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in legal costs due to our chinese customs investigation  m s patent infringement lawsuit  and the formation of smt  increased consulting and audit fees related to the sarbanes oxley internal control certification requirements  and increases in allocated shared service expenses to general and administrative expense 
restructuring restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following a million charge primarily related to reductions in headcount as part of a restructuring plan that was announced in september the goal of the announced restructuring plan is to simplify the business and return us to profitability by reducing our operating expenses 
the majority of these actions  including the elimination of several senior executive and management positions  as well as other headcount reductions  were completed in the third and fourth quarters of  with the remainder to be completed in the first half of  a million charge in the second quarter of primarily associated with severance charges for changes in supply chain management and realignment of our european sales force  and million of charges related to our december plan of restructuring associated with streamlining our operations in fredrikstad  norway  which consisted primarily of costs to vacate space under long term lease arrangements  additional severance charges in the us and europe and non cash stock based compensation expense related to former employees who transitioned to smt 
restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following a million charge in the first quarter of for consolidating employees at our research and development  factory repair and logistics site in wilsonville  oregon into our corporate headquarters building and for the transfer of our logistics and factory repair activities to ups  and a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to streamlining our operations in fredrikstad  norway 
upon formation of a new research and development subsidiary in norway for smt  a majority of our current research and development team moved to this operation 
this charge primarily related to employee severance costs 
restructuring charges totaled million in and included the following lease loss costs associated with consolidating our research and development facility in wilsonville  oregon into our headquarters building  costs associated with transitioning our logistics and factory repair activities to ups  costs associated with various management changes  streamlining our management  administrative and support functions worldwide  and leveraging our research and development investment through co development 
at december   we had a remaining accrual for all of our restructuring activities of million 
see further detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
based on our operating losses  we performed a review and evaluation of the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of pursuant to sfas no 
 we performed an expected present value analysis with multiple cash flow scenarios  weighted by estimated probabilities  using a risk free interest rate to estimate fair value 
this analysis indicated that the book value of our long lived assets exceeded the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
based on our analyses  we determined that all of our long lived assets  other than tooling equipment related to current products  were fully impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of in order to write off the remaining book value of our long lived assets other than tooling equipment used in the production of current products 
of the million charge  million was allocated to property and equipment and million was allocated to other intangible assets  including the carrying value of patents and trademarks 
all of the long lived assets are continuing to be used in operations 
these impairment charges resulted in our recording less depreciation expense beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the reduction for the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
approximately of the reduction improved gross margin and the remaining reduced operating expenses 
based on significant quarterly operating losses during the first half of  we also performed a review and evaluation of the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of this analysis  along with under utilization of certain assets  indicated that the book value of certain of our long lived assets exceeded the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of  which was allocated  on a pro rata basis  to the long lived assets 
the majority of the long lived assets were continued to be used in operations

bis is currently in the process of conducting their review of our findings 
we originally accrued an estimated charge of million for potential regulatory assessments during the second quarter of and will make adjustments as needed upon completion of the bis review and final resolution of this matter 
other income expense interest income in was million compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increasing interest rates  as well as increasing cash and investment balances in the second half of in addition  in we received interest related to income tax refunds from income tax filings from prior years 
the decline in compared to was primarily due to lower cash and investment balances  partially offset by increasing interest rates 
other income expense included the following in thousands year ended december  realized gain on the sale of equity securities income related to the profits of motif joint venture expense related to losses of smt joint venture gains losses related to foreign currency transactions write down of certain cost based investments in technology companies other motif license fees are recognized when licensees report sales and resultant royalties  which are currently only contractually required on a semi annual basis and primarily fall in the first and third quarters of each year 
the increased income related to our motif joint venture was due to increased usage of motif technology by its licensees 
included in expense related to losses on our smt joint venture is the elimination of our portion of unrealized intercompany profit in inventory at december  of million 
the elimination results in a reduction of our inventory and an increase in the loss recognized of this amount 
income taxes income tax benefit of million in is related to million of tax benefit from closing out foreign tax exposures in prior years and million net true up benefit from our tax provision to our actual tax returns 
these tax benefits are offset by million of tax expense in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions and million of tax expense due to valuation allowance applied to certain foreign deferred tax assets

the current ratio at december  and was to and to  respectively 
we sustained an operating loss of million during contributing to a decrease in net working capital of million during if we continue to experience significant operating losses and reductions in net working capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to continue current business operations 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
we have a line of credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc wells fargo to finance future working capital requirements 
the line of credit expires in october pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we may borrow against the line subject to a borrowing base determined on eligible accounts receivable 
as of march  june and september  we were out of compliance with the financial covenants contained in our line of credit with wells fargo 
we had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit as of these dates 
the line of credit requires us to achieve a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the agreement 
our non compliance was primarily a result of the operating losses we recognized in in may and again in november  we amended the line of credit and received a waiver of prior defaults from wells fargo 
as part of the november amendment  we modified the future financial covenants to levels we expect to achieve 
in addition  we agreed to certain other conditions including  among other things  allowing cash receipts from customers to flow directly to wells fargo to pay down any outstanding borrowings  and reducing the maximum amount that can be advanced under the line from million to million 
at december   we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants  and did not have any amounts outstanding on this credit facility and million was available for borrowings 
our investment in phoenix electric co  a japanese lamp manufacturing company  and various other marketable equity security investments are included as part of our short term marketable securities balance 
during  we recognized gains of million upon the sale of such securities and  as market conditions warrant  we could recognize additional gains related to sales in and beyond

however  to the extent our operating results continue to fall below our expectations  we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings 
we may also need additional capital if we pursue acquisitions or other strategic growth opportunities 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had funded our initial million commitment to smt 
we are working with smt and tcl to investigate alternatives to securing additional funding 
there is no guarantee that smt will be successful in obtaining additional funding  or whether terms and conditions that may be required to obtain such funding would be favorable to smt 
at december   we had one outstanding letter of credit totaling million which expired february  the letter of credit was subsequently renewed and currently has an expiration date of august  this letter of credit collateralizes our obligations to a supplier for the purchase of finished goods inventory 
the fair value of this letter of credit approximates its contract value 
at december   this letter of credit was collateralized by million of cash and marketable securities and was reported as restricted on the consolidated balance sheets 
the remainder of the restricted cash  totaling million  primarily related to building deposits and value added tax deposits with foreign jurisdictions 
accounts receivable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in the accounts receivable balance was primarily due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of and strong collection in all geographies 
as a result  days sales outstanding decreased to days at december  compared to days at december  inventories decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of inventory as of these dates 
during  we worked closely with our contract manufacturers to modify and reduce incoming product and better align incoming product levels with expected sales needs in order to allow us to reduce finished goods inventory 
in addition  in connection with our exit from the thin display business  our transition away from flextronics  as well as other factors  we wrote down our inventory by million in during the third quarter of  the remaining inventory being held by chinese customs authorities in connection with their investigation was released 
inventory held by the chinese customs authorities in connection with their investigation totaled million as of december  at december   we had approximately five weeks of inventory in the americas channel compared to approximately four weeks at december  annualized inventory turns were approximately times for the quarter ended december  and approximately times for the quarter ended december  velocity in our supply chain allows us to better match current costs against current sales prices  maximizing our gross margin opportunity  reducing our total investment in working capital and reducing exposure to excess and obsolete inventory 
land held for sale of million as of december  related to two plots of undeveloped land adjacent to our headquarters building in wilsonville  oregon 
we sold this land on june   receiving net proceeds of million and recognizing a gain on the sale of approximately million in the second quarter of prior to being put on the market for sale  the land was included as a component of property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets 
other current assets decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease resulted from a million decrease in other receivables related to the timing of cash received for sales of shares of phoenix stock in the fourth quarter of and reductions in prepaid expenses related to the timing of invoices 
offsetting these decreases was a million increase related to a deposit made to chinese customs officials during the first quarter of other current assets at december  and included a million and a million deposit  respectively  made to chinese customs officials in connection with their investigation of our import duties 
in addition  our value added tax receivables from the dutch government decreased million related to the timing of value added tax filings 
property and equipment  net and other assets  net decreased by million and million  respectively  due to long lived asset impairment charges taken during the third quarter of as discussed more fully above 
the remaining property and equipment balance of million at december  includes the remaining book value of tooling being used for current products  as well as additions from the fourth quarter of expenditures for property and equipment  totaling million in  were primarily for product tooling  leasehold improvements  a trade show booth and information technology upgrades 
total expenditures for property and equipment are expected to be between million and million in other assets increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  included in other assets are building deposits  minority interest investments in technology companies as part of our advanced research and development efforts  and investments in our joint ventures  smt and motif 
the increase in other assets in was primarily due to strategic minority interest investments in technology companies and investments in our joint venture smt 
in  we made a million investment in smt offset by a recognized loss of million for an ending investment balance of million 
in  the value of our investment in motif increased million related to our share of its quarterly profits 
the million increase in the value of our investment in motif in included million of recognized gains for our share of quarterly profits  which was almost entirely offset by dividend payments received from motif in in addition  other assets increased by million related to long term assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the university network in the second quarter of  offset by million of amortization on the purchased assets in these increases were partially offset by the million impairment charge on intangible assets mentioned above 
based on changes in financing alternatives and strategic shifts that occurred during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the write down of two separate cost based investments  reflectivity and vst international  both start up technology companies 
both companies are in the process of raising additional capital to fund future activities at significantly reduced valuations 
it is not likely that we will participate in these future funding activities  which will lead to a significant dilution in our ownership interests  thus impairing our current investment 
the write down of million in the first quarter of effectively reduced the carrying value of these cost based investments to zero at march  accounts payable increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to the timing of payments offset by reduction of recognized liability for inventory in transit at december  due to the negotiation of more favorable terms with vendors 
related party accounts payable at december  were million and represent outstanding payables to smt for the purchase of projectors 
smt began producing product for sale to us in mid payroll and related benefits payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in payroll and payroll related benefits payable was primarily attributed to payouts in the first quarter of of profit sharing and incentive compensation that were accrued in in addition  accrued vacation and social security taxes payable in europe decreased in due to the timing of payments and a reduction in headcount 
overall accrued payroll was reduced due to reductions in headcount worldwide as part of the restructuring actions 
other current liabilities increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to accruals related to our restructuring activities and a million accrual for possible regulatory assessments as discussed above 
included in other current liabilities at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  related to restructuring 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond letters of credit purchase order commitments operating leases seasonality given the buying patterns of various geographies and market segments  our revenues are subject to certain elements of seasonality during various portions of the year 
historically  between and of our revenues have come from europe and  as such  we typically experience a seasonal downturn due to the vacation season in mid summer  which results in decreased revenues from that region in the third quarter compared to the second quarter 
conversely  we typically experience a strong resurgence of revenue from europe in the fourth quarter 
this  coupled with a strong business and retail holiday buying season in the fourth quarter by larger wholesale distribution partners and retailers  typically leads to our strongest revenues being in the fourth quarter of each year 
in addition  we sell our products into the education and government markets that typically see seasonal peaks in the united states in the third quarter of each year 
the first quarter of each year is typically down from the immediately preceding fourth quarter due to corporate buying trends and typical aggressive competition from our asian competitors with march fiscal year ends 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivables credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
in certain situations  if an account is determined to be a bad debt we may also use collection agencies to work with the customer for payment for a fee 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
at december  and  our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
bad debt expense recovery totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and allowance for sales returns and other deductions from revenue some distributor  dealer and retailer agreements allow for partial return of products and or price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to a contractually defined short term stock rotation and defective or damaged product although we have granted retailers return policies consistent with the retailers return policies for their customers 
we maintain a reserve for sales returns and price adjustments based on historical experience and other qualitative factors 
we also have incentive programs for dealers and distributors whereby rebates are offered based upon exceeding volume goals 
estimated sales returns  price protection and rebates are deducted from revenue 
historical return rates are monitored on a product by product basis 
as new products are introduced  these historical rates are used to establish initial sales returns reserves and are adjusted as better information becomes available 
we also regularly monitor and track channel inventory with our significant customers 
variability in channel inventory levels from quarter to quarter is further used to qualitatively adjust our returns reserves 
typically  return rates worldwide have averaged in a relatively tight range of to of sales to customers who are granted such rights 
if a dramatic change in the rate of returns were to occur  our estimate of our sales return accrual could change significantly 
one of the factors we consider in estimating future returns  for the customers who are granted such rights  is the sell through of products by our distributors and dealers 
we have controls in place to monitor channel inventory levels with these customers 
we believe the risk of returns increases when inventory held by any particular customer exceeds their near term needs 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on certain channel inventory estimated to be in excess of days 
our reserves deducted from revenues and accounts receivable for sales returns  price protection and other rebates totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and historically  our actual experience for sales returns  price protection and rebates has not differed materially from our estimates 
inventory valuation we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions  as well as other factors 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing  sales  finance and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
service inventory is systematically written down based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory 
we record write downs for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
at december  and  our inventory valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a reduction of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets 
product warranties we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties on a quarterly basis 
we offer a standard one year or two year warranty 
our standard one year warranty is offered on our higher volume value platforms  while our standard two year warranty is offered on our lower volume higher priced product platforms 
in addition  for certain customers  products  and regions  the standard warranty period offered may cover a period of or years 
we monitor failure rates on a product category basis through data collected by our manufacturing sites  factory repair centers and authorized service providers 
the service organizations also track costs to repair each unit 
costs include labor to repair the projector  replacement parts for defective items and freight costs  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered as well as any cost recoveries of defective parts and material  which may be repaired at a factory repair center or through a third party 
this data is then used to calculate the accrual based on actual sales for each projector category and remaining warranty periods 
for new product introductions  our quality control department estimates the initial failure rates based on test and manufacturing data and historical experience for similar platform projectors 
if circumstances change  or a dramatic change in the failure rates were to occur  our estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
revenue generated from sales of extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized to revenue over the term of the extended warranty coverage 
deferred warranty revenue totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our warranty accrual at december  and totaled million  and is included as accrued warranty and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million against deferred tax assets  which resulted in a net deferred tax asset balance of million and million  respectively 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
based on these reviews  we recorded impairment charges totaling million in the third quarter of and million in the third quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these impairment charges 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
our net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  we have no plans of liquidating any of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates through the purchase and sale of products denominated in non functional foreign currencies 
we have established a foreign currency derivative program  utilizing foreign currency forward contracts forward contracts to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are substantially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not use forward contracts as speculative instruments for trading purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in our foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
these forward contracts are not designated as qualifying hedges and  accordingly  are marked to market at the end of each period  with the resulting gain or loss being recorded as a component of other income or expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the contractual amounts of our forward exchange contracts in us dollars as of december  the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
the foreign currency amounts have been translated into a us dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate at the reporting date 
forward contracts outstanding at december  mature in days or less from december  and were as follows in thousands 
bought sold foreign currency euro british pound singapore dollar swedish krona norwegian kroner amount outstanding interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our line of credit and our investment portfolio 
our million line of credit facility with wells fargo bears interest on outstanding borrowings at prime plus  however  at no time will the interest rate be below 
as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under our line of credit and  therefore  a change in the prime rate would not have had any effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we mitigate interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included marketable debt securities of million and marketable equity securities of million 
marketable equity securities are adjusted to fair market value at the end of each period with the associated unrealized gains or losses recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the marketable debt securities are carried at amortized cost  but are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
at december   the fair market value of our marketable debt securities totaled million 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
