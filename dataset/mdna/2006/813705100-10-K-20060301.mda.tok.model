gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in gross profit for products decreased to in compared to in this decline was driven by increased sales volume on products containing a hardware component  primarily the safeword token sales  which have a lower gross profit margin than our software products

similar to  we anticipate that we will be in an alternative minimum taxable income position in tax expense of  incurred for various foreign income taxes and  incurred for state income tax in was offset by the reversal of a like amount of the previously established valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset

deferred taxes are required to be measured at the regular tax rate 
an analysis recently completed of our regular tax rate  indicated that our tax rate had changed 
accordingly the deferred tax components  including the valuation allowance  were adjusted as a result of applying the appropriate rate

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the tax effect of these items in estimates were used in the determination of our provision for income taxes  current income taxes payable  as well as in our deferred tax asset and liability analysis

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical factors and other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions  estimates  or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i sales of products  including hardware  subscriptions  software licenses  and royalties and ii sales of services  including maintenance arrangements to provide upgrades and customer support and professional services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
subscription based contracts and maintenance and support contracts are generally for  or months in duration 
subscription revenue along with maintenance revenue for providing product upgrades and customer support are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period beginning with the month the subscription or service begins 
for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to the various elements based on the fair value of each element sold 
we determine the fair value of each element based on its selling price when sold separately 
evidence of fair value includes the approved price list and discount schedule and the actual prices charged for comparable arrangements 
these price lists and discount schedules may change from time to time in response to factors including market conditions  value of services and product provided and competitive positioning 
historically  we have not offered significant discounts off of our list prices 
further  it is our policy that our distributors and resellers are not allowed to hold inventory with the exception of international resellers who are allowed to hold inventories of safeword for citrix and other safeword for products 
this is a low price point product with disproportionately high overseas freight costs 
as such  we allow the reseller to carry a balance of inventory and provide end user sell through reporting 
revenue is recognized at the point that we receive evidence of sell through to the end user 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness  changes in our customer payment cycles  and current economic trends 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  capitalized software costs  a purchased customer list  purchased control lists  capitalized developed technology and goodwill  all of which are recorded at cost or fair value 
patents  trademarks  customer and control lists  and capitalized developed technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range up to years 
see our accounting policy of capitalized software costs under research and development in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is not 
table of contents amortized  but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
if impairment is indicated  a write down would be recorded as an impairment loss in income from operations 
we review our long lived assets and identified finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  except for goodwill as noted above 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some component or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the computations of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are based on taxable income we expect to earn on sales of existing products and projected interest and other income over the next three years 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
however  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or we are unable to implement our tax strategies 
inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of our first annual reporting period beginning january  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date 
table of contents and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have evaluated the two methods and have determined to implement the modified prospective method 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements 
we are currently assessing the impact of sab no 
on our implementation and adoption of sfas no 
r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and corrections 
sfas no 
replaces accounting principles bulletin opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
also provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections 
this statement is applicable for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in november  the fasb issued a staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we believe the adoption of fsp will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and our accounts receivable more difficult to collect 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and commercial paper 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held as available for sale 
we also hold an equity interest in a privately held technology company 
this investment was recorded at cost and is reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  this investment had a carrying value of million 
we believe our operations are currently not subject to significant market risks for foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  or other relevant market price risks of a material nature
