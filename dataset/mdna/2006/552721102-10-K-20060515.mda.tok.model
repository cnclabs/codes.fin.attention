quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through maintenance of local production facilities in the markets served  invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products and use of foreign currency denominated debt in denmark 
the company has used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risks 
the forward contracts are short term in duration  generally one year or less 
the major currency exposure hedged by the company has been the canadian dollar 
the contract amounts  carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts were not significant at january   and the company has attempted to mitigate its interest rate risk by maintaining a balance of fixed rate long term debt and floating rate debt 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce its exposure to market risks from changing interest rates under the revolving credit agreement 
under the terms of the swap agreement  the company agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to the notional principal amount 
any differences paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of the swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation 
financial instruments are not held or issued for trading purposes

the company attempts to mitigate such risks by obtaining price commitments from its commodity suppliers and  when it appears appropriate  purchasing quantities in advance of likely price increases
