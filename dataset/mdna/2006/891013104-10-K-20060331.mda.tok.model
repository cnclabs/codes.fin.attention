item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations discussion of years ended december    and because a modified cash basis of accounting is utilized by the trust  net proceeds attributable to the underlying properties for the years ended december   and are derived from actual oil and gas production from october  through september   october  through september  and october  through september   respectively 
the following tables 
table of contents set forth oil and gas sales attributable to the underlying properties during the three years ended december  bbls of oil chalkley field robinson s bend field cotton valley fields austin chalk fields total mcf of gas chalkley field robinson s bend field cotton valley fields austin chalk fields total for the year ended december   net profits income was million  as compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the decrease in net profits income during as compared to is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in as a result of workovers performed on wells in the chalkley field  cotton valley fields and austin chalk fields 
the decrease in net profits income during as compared to is primarily due to the trust receiving no payments with respect to the robinson s bend field during in addition to increased lease operating expenses and capital expenditures in as compared to commencing with the second quarter of distribution pertaining to the quarter ended march  production lease operating expenses and capital expenditures have been deducted in calculating robinson s bend net proceeds 
the trust received approximately million in for payments for distributions to unitholders with respect to the robinson s bend field 
the trust received no payments for distributions to unitholders with respect to the robinson s bend field during the six months ended december  and during the years ended december  and during the period from july  to december   robinson s bend field cumulative deficit was approximately  during the quarter ended march   net proceeds generated from the net profits interests exceeded robinson s bend field cumulative deficit 
accordingly  distributions received by unitholders during the quarter ended march  included approximately  of net proceeds from the net profits interests in the robinson s bend field 
if a robinson s bend cumulative deficit were to develop again  unitholders would cease to receive proceeds attributable to the robinson s bend field until future future proceeds exceeded future costs and expenses and the cumulative excess of such costs and expenses including interest attributable to the robinson s bend field 
gas production attributable to the underlying properties in the chalkley  cotton valley and austin chalk fields was  mcf   mcf and  mcf in  and  respectively 
gas production attributable to the underlying properties in the robinson s bend field was  mcf   mcf and  mcf in  and  respectively 
gas production decreased during each of the years ended december  as a result of normal production declines 
oil production attributable to the underlying properties for the year ended december  was  bbls as compared to  bbls and  bbls for the same periods in and  respectively 

table of contents the average price used to calculate net proceeds for gas  before gathering  treating and transportation deductions  during the year ended december  was per mmbtu as compared to and per mmbtu for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average price used to calculate net proceeds for oil during the years ended december   and was  and per bbl  respectively 
when temi pays a purchase price for gas based on the minimum price  temi receives price credits which it is entitled to deduct in determining the purchase price when the index price for gas exceeds the minimum price 
as of december   temi had no outstanding price credits 
no price credits were deducted in calculating the purchase price related to distributions during the three years ended december  additionally  if the index price for gas exceeds per mmbtu  adjusted annually for inflation per mmbtu  per mmbtu and per mmbtu for  and production  respectively  temi is entitled to deduct of such excess in calculating the purchase price 
such price sharing arrangement reduced net proceeds during the years ended december    and by million  million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  the trust was distributed approximately  and  respectively  of infill well proceeds generated from infill wells located in the cotton valley fields 
the trust did not receive any proceeds pertaining to such wells during the year ended december  as the infill wells costs and expenses exceeded gross revenues prior to january  lease operating expenses and capital expenditures attributable to the underlying properties in the chalkley  cotton valley and austin chalk fields deducted in calculating distributions during the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in costs and expenses during each of the years ended december  and is mainly due to workovers performed on certain wells in the chalkley  cotton valley and austin chalk fields 
higher insurance expense and increased lease operating expenses in the chalkley field during also contributed to the increase in costs and expenses in general and administrative expenses during each of the years ended december   and amounted to million 
these expenses primarily relate to administrative services provided by torch and the trustee  and legal fees 
for the year ended december   distributable income was million  or per unit  as compared to million  or per unit  and million  or per unit  for the same periods in and  respectively 
total cash distributions of million  or per unit  were made during the year ended december  as compared to million  or per unit  and million  or per unit  for the same periods in and  respectively 

table of contents net profits received by the trust during the years ended december   and  derived from production sold during the twelve months ended september   and  respectively  was computed as shown in the following table in thousands year ended december  chalkley  robinson s chalkley  robinson s chalkley  robinson s cotton valley and bend cotton valley and bend cotton valley and bend austin chalk fields field total austin chalk fields field total austin chalk fields field total oil and gas revenues direct operating expenses lease operating expenses including property tax   a   a   a severance tax net proceeds before capital expenditures capital expenditures net proceeds net profits percentage b b b net profits income a commencing with the second quarter distribution pertaining to production during the quarter ended march   lease operating expenses and capital expenditures were deducted in calculating net proceeds from the robinson s bend field 
lease operating expenses and capital expenditures in thousands were   and  during  and  respectively 
b with respect to the robinson s bend field  the trust received no cash distributions during the six months ended december  and during each of the years ended december  and during such periods  the robinson s bend field costs and expenses including interest exceeded revenues by approximately  termination of the trust the trust will terminate on march of any year if it is determined that the pre tax future net cash flows  discounted at  attributable to estimated net proved reserves of the net profits interests on the preceding december are less than million 
the pre tax future net cash flows  discounted at  attributable to estimated net proved reserves of the net profits interests as of december  was approximately million 
such reserve report was prepared pursuant to securities and exchange commission guidelines and utilized an unescalated henry hub spot price for natural gas on december  of per mmbtu 
the december  reserve value was greater than million 
therefore  the trust did not terminate on march  based on oil and gas reserve estimates at december  prepared by independent reserve engineers  torch projects that unless the henry hub spot price for natural gas on december  exceeds approximately per mmbtu  the trust will terminate on march  upon termination of the trust  the trustee is required to sell the net profits interests 
no assurances can be given that the trustee will be able to sell the net profits interests  or the price that will be distributed to unitholders following such a sale 
such distributions could be below the market value of the units 

table of contents critical accounting policy reserve estimates the proved reserves of the trust are estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgement 
for example  estimates are made regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs  production volumes and severance taxes  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also change 
any variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the trust s reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  the reserves are significant to the potential automatic termination of the trust if it is determined that the pre tax future net cash flows  discounted at  attributable to the estimated net proved reserves of the net profits interests are less than million 
independent petroleum engineering firms are engaged to estimate the trust s proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
modified cash basis the financial statements of the trust are prepared on a modified cash basis although financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission are normally required to be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
since the operations of the trust are limited to the distribution of income from the net profits interests  the item of primary importance to the reader of the financial statements of the trust is the amount of cash distributions to the unitholders for the period reported 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices 
the trust s assets constitute net profits interests in the underlying properties 
as a result  the trust s operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces and the price received for production from the underlying properties 
all production from the underlying properties is sold pursuant to a purchase contract between trc  velasco  and temi 
pursuant to the purchase contract  temi is obligated to purchase all net production attributable to the underlying properties for an index price  less certain other charges  which are calculated monthly 
the index price calculation is based on market prices of oil and gas and therefore is subject to commodity price risk 
the purchase contract expires upon termination of the trust and provides a minimum price paid by temi for gas 
the minimum price is adjusted annually for inflation and was  and per mmbtu for  and  respectively 
when temi pays a purchase price based on the minimum price  it receives price credits equal to the difference between the index price and the minimum price that it is entitled to deduct when the index price exceeds the minimum price 
additionally  if the index price exceeds the sharing price  temi is entitled to deduct such excess  the price differential 
the sharing price was  and per mmbtu in  and  respectively 
temi has an annual option to discontinue the minimum price commitment 
however  if temi discontinues the minimum price commitment  it will no longer be entitled to deduct the price differential and will forfeit all accrued price credits 
temi has not exercised its option to discontinue the minimum price commitment
