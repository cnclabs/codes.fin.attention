history digimarc was incorporated in the company was founded to commercialize a signal processing innovation known as digital watermarking 
digital watermarking is a technology breakthrough that allows our customers to infuse digital data into any media content that is digitally processed at some point during its lifecycle 
the technology can be applied to printed materials  video  audio  and images 
the inclusion of such digital data enables a wide range of improvements in security and media management  and enables new business models for distribution and consumption of media content 
we use digital watermarking as a value driver and differentiator in nearly all of our product offerings 
banknote counterfeit deterrence was the first commercially successful use of digital watermarking 
digimarc  in cooperation with an international consortium of leading central banks  developed a system to deter the use of digital technologies in the unauthorized reproduction of banknotes 
more recently  innovations based on the company s digital watermarking technology and experience have been leveraged to create new products to deter counterfeiting and tampering of driver licenses and other government issued secure credentials 
in parallel  digimarc s business partners  under patent license from digimarc  are delivering digital watermarking solutions to track and monitor the distribution of music  television  movies and radio to consumers 
on the heels of  we realized that our expertise in security printing and digital imaging technologies and systems placed us in a position to understand both the digital threats to identity management credentials and the issuer s environment 
in late  we acquired the large government programs lgp business unit of polaroid corporation polaroid 
the primary focus of this business is the production of driver licenses dls and other ids issued by government agencies 
the acquired assets included all relevant software  hardware  services  materials science and distribution assets of polaroid s government issued photo identification business 
in this strategic acquisition  we saw a unique opportunity to assist in efforts to deter identity theft and fraud and enhance transportation safety and homeland security through the combination of a new layer of security using our digital watermarking innovations and market leading competence in secure id solutions from polaroid 
the resulting business has more than years of experience in the delivery and operation of secure id issuance systems  has produced more than billion issued ids  and has guided customers through numerous major upgrades and technology migrations in id security 
we are the leader in deploying new solutions to meet driver license security and related service challenges 
this includes being first to produce driver licenses with digital portraits  deploy facial recognition and state wide fingerprint matching in and  introduce market leading security features  including digital watermarking  kinegrams  and secure card materials  produce driver licenses in secure  networked central issuance factories  offer driver license renewal by internet  and offer a comprehensive and modular id validation and archiving suite to address recently enacted federal legislation  such as the real id act 
with increasing interest in issues surrounding homeland security  prevention of identity theft and fraud  traffic safety  copyright and intellectual property protection and establishment of new business models for digital distribution and use of media content  digimarc has evolved from a technology driven early stage company to an important supplier of critical infrastructure to government agencies and a strategic business partner to solution providers supporting the media and entertainment industry 
vision and mission the company s vision is to improve the value of media content through technology 
its mission is two fold foster large scale adoption of digital watermarking solutions licensed under the company s intellectual property be the most desired profitable supplier of driver license issuance systems the provision of issuance systems for driver licenses and other government issued credentials furthers the adoption of digital watermarking as this technology is increasingly included as a security feature of such documents 
customers the majority of digimarc s revenues is derived from supplying infrastructure to government agencies pursuant to long term contracts  primarily state dl issuers  a consortium of leading central banks  and national governments of various foreign countries 
the retention rate for our driver license customers is high 
our contract with the central banks is in its eighth year 
last year we agreed upon a year extension  with two additional year extensions that we expect to be implemented 
the remainder of the company s revenue is generated through commercial applications of its digital watermarking and related technologies  primarily from patent and technology license fees paid by business partners providing media and rights management solutions to movie studios and music labels  television and radio broadcasters  creative professionals and other customers around the world 
patent licensing is expected to continue to contribute most of the revenues from non government customers for the foreseeable future 
digimarc views its patent licensees and government agency customers as long term business partners and believes that a focus on customer satisfaction will foster future growth and improved financial performance 
representative customers and business partners include state and national government agencies that issue driver licenses  national ids and voter credentials  including us states  the district of columbia  two canadian provinces  latvia  mexico and russia  an international consortium of the world s leading central banks  and activated content  dolby laboratories cinea  gcs research  mediagrid  nielsen media research  royal philips electronics  thomson  signum  verance and verimatrix 
government products and services the company provides financial document security and secure id solutions to government agencies financial document security 
the company has a multi year contract with an international consortium of central banks in which it has developed  deployed  and is supporting and continuing to enhance a system to deter digital counterfeiting of currency using personal computers and digital reprographics 
work on the system began in details of the system are confidential for security reasons 
secure id solutions 
as the leading provider of government issued secure ids in north america  digimarc systems produce more than million driver licenses and other secure personal identification documents per year 
two thirds of the us states and many foreign governments  including russia  latvia  mexico  and canada  use digimarc secure id solutions to issue credentials to citizens 
in north america  we are generally a prime contractor  providing full issuance systems to federal  state  and provincial departments of motor vehicles or other government issuing authorities 
our north american driver license issuance systems vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
these systems are typically provided pursuant to long term normally five or more years contracts 
the systems provided include the hardware  software  consumable supplies such as ribbons  blank or preprinted card marterials  and laminates  and on going support necessary for a turnkey solution 
they typically involve custom software and or hardware development  integration services  and implementation services 
when we provide a full issuance system to a customer  we generally retain title to all assets associated with the system and are responsible for maintaining the system over the contractual period 
a digital driver license issuance system typically captures images photo and signature and demographic information  validates applicant identity  produces the actual driver license or identification document either at the point of service or at a central production facility operated by us  provides or delivers the finished driver license or other identity document to the individual licensee  stores the images and associated data in a database  and communicates with the issuer s other systems for completion of processing of the driver license applicants 
digital driver license workstations installed in government driver license offices typically consist of a personal computer  digital camera system  signature capture device  network interface hardware  and other associated peripherals as required  including card printers  receipt printers  dossier printers  scanners  fingerprint capture devices  and bar code readers 
most of this hardware is sourced from third party suppliers 
we provide software application components that drive the specific peripherals and workflow to process the applicants through the capture and printing sequences 
graphical user interfaces  encoding of business rules into the work flow sequences  and communication interfaces are custom developed to the specific needs of the customer 
we provide services in conjunction with state and national databases to confirm the validity of applicant provided information 
some commercial off the shelf software is also provided  such as operating systems typically microsoft windows xp  and virus protection 
additionally  we often provide the necessary database design  hardware  and software to store portrait  signature  and biometric images for later retrieval 
we generally supply the document consumables  including card materials  custom laminates  printer ribbons  mailing supplies  and receipt paper 
in the case of installations that issue documents from a central location  we provide a large scale central production system  including high volume personalization printers  lamination and die cutting machinery  encoding equipment  workstations  files servers  and proprietary software to control the production process and adhere to process and product quality levels 
the typical central production capability is designed to produce tens of thousands of documents per day 
we usually provide the production facility and staffing for turnkey production of the documents pursuant to a fixed price contract 
our sales and marketing organization for north america id issuing systems is organized into geographic territories with senior level sales business development professionals and program management assigned to each territory 
because our contracts are long term in nature  and the market is relatively homogeneous and stable  long term relationships are key to our successful positioning for new opportunities and for maximizing potential within existing accounts 
contracts are most often granted through competitive bidding based on either best value or low compliant cost to the issuing jurisdiction 
a bids proposals organization  consisting of bid managers  technical writers  production assistants and technical support  is responsible for working with our sales and program management staffs to deliver winning bids based on sales positioning and strategy 
our marketing group is responsible for translating market sales needs into product plans  supporting the sales effort with necessary collateral and market positioning  and managing long term company strategy 
an industry association  the american association of motor vehicle administrators  to which all north american driver license agencies belong  provides us with another vehicle for marketing and education within our north american customer community through regional and international conferences  seminars  and trade shows 
in non us markets  where we provide driver licenses  national identification  and voter identification systems  services  and components in partnership with local card producers  security printers  system integrators  and others  we may serve as prime contractor or sub contractor  depending on the circumstances 
international sales for us have typically taken the form of an outright sale of equipment and or consumables to international government agencies or their prime contractors 
when we provide a partial credential issuance system to a customer  we usually transfer title of the assets to the customer upon delivery and typically have no further obligations 
we are paid on standard billing terms upon delivery of the assets 
when we provide services for a partial credential issuance system  we usually are paid in accordance with customary commercial practice upon performance of the services 
our customers are increasingly sensitive to the issue of identity theft and fraud  to concerns around verifying personal identity and  in the case of us customers  to the role that the us driver license plays as a primary form of identity verification for personal access to secure facilities and public transportation  the conduct of financial transactions  and at point of sale for age restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco 
as a result  we believe there will be increasing interest from our customers in a variety of fraud detection and prevention systems  including biometric based solutions based on third party technologies 
we are a leading provider of biometric solutions in the driver license market  operating systems that process tens of millions of fingerprint or facial images 
as an example  our facial recognition solutions can help our customers determine if an applicant may have already been issued a valid license within a particular jurisdiction  and our fingerprinting and fingerprint matching solutions can be used to verify an applicant s identity prior to issuance of credentials such as a commercial driver license 
several states incorporate identity verification solutions which employ a background check on the applicant supplied demographic data during the initial enrollment process  further enhancing the integrity of the issuance process 
we are working on broadening our security offerings to provide more integrated identity verification and fraud detection capabilities within the issuance workflow of our customers 
many aspects of our advanced technology solutions anticipate both the mandate of federal legislation passed in may known as the real id act the real id act and the emerging consensus on best practices consistent with our product and service strategy 
some of the requirements of the real id act that may require states to upgrade to be in compliance include applicant data capture capture digital images of identity source documents in a transferable format retain copies of source documents years for paper or years for image conduct mandatory facial image capture identity verification verify  with the issuing agency  the issuance  validity  and completeness of each document verify the legal residency of a person confirm or verify a renewing applicant s information confirm with social security administration all applicant social security numbers using the full digit number confirm termination of previous license in another state before issuance provide electronic access to all other states to information contained in the motor vehicle database of the state secure credential and id validation limit validity period of ids implement physical security features designed to prevent tampering  counterfeiting  or duplication deploy common machine readable technology  with defined minimum data elements serving government needs for citizen identity management involves successfully delivering solutions that span the secure id lifecycle  ranging from demographic data capture  identity validation  and applicant data and biometric verification systems  to the design and secure production of credentials incorporating linked and layered security features  culminating with effective id authentication deployed at various points of inspection 
it also requires the expertise to integrate these solutions with existing government agency applications and it infrastructure  and the service  support and training necessary to effectively manage the implementations over the course of long term customer relationships 
digimarc has worked extensively with driver license issuers across the us to strengthen their issuance systems and secure credential designs 
as a result  the company has identified and implemented numerous best practices throughout its processes and developed modular  flexible solutions designed to improve security within each component of the secure id lifecycle from the time an applicant applies for or renews his or her driver license  to the secure production and issuance of the id to the legitimate cardholder  to the authentication of that document at a traffic stop  a bank  a border crossing  a store  or the dmv 
the chart below maps digimarc s solutions to an overview of the secure id lifecycle 
graphic applicant data capture and identity verification 
validation of documents and verification of applicant identity are keys to the secure intake and enrollment process  and a critical step toward ensuring that driver licenses are only issued to legitimate applicants 
in  digimarc introduced the digimarc identity validation suite idvs to validate identity documents and verify the biometric and demographic data presented to establish an applicant s identity 
as identity credentials become more secure and difficult to counterfeit  counterfeiters turn to producing false breeder documents to fuel attempts to fraudulently obtain valid secure credentials 
thus the process of validating identity is becoming central to secure id issuance as document quality improves  ensuring that only valid applicants receive genuine ids 
this market development is underscored by the focus of the real id act on identity validation 
idvs is the company s most strategic product offering in  enabling migration to compliance with the real id act  and serving a growing demand by our customers for effective multi factor identification of applicants 
digimarc s role in the secure id lifecycle is expanding to one that encompasses identity validation and leads the company toward a larger role in the enrollment application 
idvs works in concert with other aspects of our solution such as our dl imaging capture suite 
the capture suite enables secure id and driver license issuers to capture high quality portraits  signatures and fingerprints needed to complete the intake and enrollment process 
this step is important to security and customer satisfaction  providing high quality photos and reliable biometric verification 
secure production 
once an applicant s demographic information and images have been captured  screened and verified  digimarc solutions enable issuers to securely produce and personalize a secure and highly durable driver license 
digimarc offers several flexible options  including secure over the counter instant issuance systems  central issuance systems  and hybrid over the counter central issue systems 
secure credential 
an integral part of enhancing id security is the design and production of the secure credential itself 
cost effective security is achieved through a card architecture that combines multiple layered and linked security features such as digital watermarks  special printing and kinegrams with durable  counterfeit resistant materials in digimarc s line of proprietary card products 
with its industry leading exian card products  digimarc has developed and incorporated many innovative security features in its driver license credentials 
key among these is idmarc  a digimarc proprietary security feature built around the company s proprietary digital watermarking technology 
this feature links together elements of the id in a way that is imperceptible under normal use  can be added to existing designs  and is readily detected by enabled software and hardware 
idmarc enables post issuance cross jurisdictional validation of documents 
digimarc secure credentials often contain more than a dozen separate overt and covert security elements that protect against tampering or counterfeiting  and digital watermarking provides the core machine readable security feature 
point of inspection validation 
the secure id lifecycle is not complete unless that document is routinely validated at the point of use 
with the introduction of security features such as idmarc  digimarc s secure ids carry machine readable features that allow for low cost and effective cross jurisdictional authentication  augmenting visual inspection to determine if a presented driver license matches one of the more than valid driver license designs 
digimarc conducted a pilot study on point of inspection validation with the us department of transportation and the state of nebraska 
the project included pilots with law enforcement and the retail sale of age controlled products  demonstrating valuable applications to enhance citizen and traffic safety 
media and entertainment the company licenses its technology and patents and otherwise fosters development of the market for digital watermarking based solutions for commercial as well as governmental uses 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  these licenses have primarily involved use of our technology and patents in the media and entertainment area 
commercial customers use secure media solutions from digimarc and its business partners to identify  track  manage and protect content as it is distributed and consumed either digitally or physically and to enable new consumer applications to access networks and information from pcs and mobile devices 
many movie studios  record labels  broadcasters  creative professionals and other customers rely on digital watermarking as a cost effective means to deter piracy and illegal use of movies  music and images  protect entertainment content from copyright infringement  track and monitor entertainment content for rights usage and licensing compliance  monitor advertisements to verify ad placement and measure return on investment  and enable fair and legitimate use of content by consumers 
our business partners include activated content  dolby laboratories cinea  gcs research  mediagrid  nielsen media research  royal philips electronics  signum  thomson  verance and verimatrix 
while each partner addresses particular customer needs  as a whole they are propagating digital watermarking in music  movies  images  and television and radio as a means to improve media rights and asset management  reduce piracy losses  improve marketing programs  and provide more efficient and effective distribution of valuable media content 
our business partners applications of digital watermarking include the following forensic tracking forensic tracking allows content owners to determine when and where a unit of media content leaves its authorized distribution channel 
the most common use of forensic tracking is in the entertainment industry  where music and movies are routinely distributed to executives  critics and other media outlets for promotion before they are released to the public 
in recent years  copies of these pre release products have been leaked onto the internet  or copied onto cds and dvds  and sold as bootlegs well ahead of their commercial release 
these unauthorized activities result in loss of revenues for the artists  the studios and the music labels 
to combat pre release piracy  music companies and movie studios embed pre release content with digital watermarks that are unique to each authorized recipient 
this allows the content creators to forensically track the source of leaks and take appropriate actions 
as a result  recipients of pre release music and movies have begun to police themselves in order to avoid liability for unauthorized use 
the use of digital watermarking solutions from our business partners for forensic tracking of pre release movies and music has gained a strong foothold in hollywood 
for instance  digital watermarking is incorporated in millions of audio tracks from major record labels to identify and track leaks of promotional  pre release music onto the internet 
customers of these solutions from digimarc and business partners such as activated content and philips electronics include sonybmg  universal music group and warner music  mastering studios  disk duplicators and online business to business music distributors 
in a similar application for movies  digital watermarking has been identified by representatives of the movie studios as dramatically reducing piracy of movies in the academy award screener program 
digital watermarking may also play a role in the movie industry s transition from film reel distribution to digital file format distribution for theatrical release 
in july  the digital cinema initiative  which is supported by disney  fox  mgm  paramount  sony pictures entertainment  universal and warner bros 
studios  released its digital cinema system specification  which details industry guidelines designed to help spur deployment of digital cinema systems for the hundreds of thousands of movie theater screens in the united states and around the world while establishing uniform levels of security  distribution  performance  reliability and quality control 
the specification requires that digital cinema systems be capable of applying digital watermarks in both the video and audio streams of digital movies upon request of the studios or other content providers 
the digital watermarks can be used as a forensic tool to help identify the theater  location  and production version and the date and time that a film plays in a specific theater 
broadcast monitoring broadcast monitoring allows clients to identify where  when and how their media content is being aired 
this type of information is important to many different types of users 
for example  every day  thousands of advertisements run in thousands of markets across the country 
with highly regionalized cable  satellite and terrestrial delivery  advertising agencies and their clients need to know that the advertisements they pay for are actually being broadcast 
by using digital watermarking based services  these companies can monitor broadcasts in major media markets around the world  verify compliance by broadcast partners  and measure the effectiveness of the campaign 
as another example of how such information is used  advertisers such as coca cola and pepsi  and broadcast networks such as abc television network  nbc news channel  bbc and reuters television  currently apply solutions from digimarc partners that enable monitoring of broadcasts on over a thousand channels in more than countries worldwide  studying the distribution of their content  verifying compliance by broadcast partners  and measuring the effectiveness of broadcasts 
copy prevention digital watermarks allow companies to control the use of copyrighted image  audio and video content 
a watermark travels with the content  persisting through the changes in file format  and through transformation between digital and analog form and back again 
this allows the content owner to specify whether or how often the work can be legally copied or shared without visually or audibly impairing the work 
it also allows greater and safer dissemination of copyrighted works while at the same time ensuring appropriate compensation to the owners 
digital watermarking from verance  a digimarc business partner  has been deployed in conjunction with licensed dvd audio implementations to prevent playback of unauthorized copies 
digital watermarking is currently under consideration as an important security layer for additional audiovisual media content and in october of  dvd copy control association dvd cca issued a request for expressions of interest to evaluate technologies for the purpose of selecting a technology for use in marking audio visual content to convey certain content control information cci 
the selected technology will be used to enhance the content scramble system css copy protection system for audio visual content that is used to protect dvd movies 
the dvd cca s earlier watermarking evaluation efforts concluded in july of without selection of a watermarking technology 
according to the request  it appears that the dvd cca anticipates that the optimal solution for addressing their needs is likely to be audio watermarking

digital image management our own digital watermarking product portfolio includes our digimarc imagebridge and digimarc mypicturemarc products  focused on digital image management during the first half of digimarc also announced upgrades to its image protection products targeted to creative professionals  and published a beta version of an enhanced desktop image search made possible by digital watermarking 
in addition to these solutions  we believe that further digital watermark media solutions may emerge such as the following rights management because digital watermarks can be applied and detected at various points between distribution and playback  they can be valuable for rights management and re association 
among other things  new applications could be developed to allow consumers to move their digitally watermarked content through their various playback devices eg personal computers and cd players and different drm encryption and decryption environments while preserving the identity of the content through use of a digital watermark and enabling rights re association as appropriate in downstream devices 
filtering classification the popularity of peer to peer pp music swapping services  such as napster  brought the issue of content and rights management to a crisis point 
because pp systems have difficulty determining which media files are copyrighted and which are not  it is relatively easy for content to be illegally distributed across these networks 
digital watermarks could allow pp systems to better identify and distinguish copyrighted from non copyrighted audio or video files and thereby facilitate legal file sharing 
digital watermarks could also enhance pp systems by enabling them to collaborate with record labels and other audio retailers to link to and market legitimate copyrighted songs 
a june us supreme court ruling metro goldwyn mayer studios vs 
grokster identified digital watermarking as one of the solutions that could help curb copyright infringement and illegal distribution of music or movies shared across pp networks 
the ruling recognizes the possibility that digital watermarks could be used to identify media content and associated rights and enable downstream consumers and systems to act appropriately as they access such content 
digital watermarking technology can also enable consumers to more easily access and effectively control digital content 
digital watermarking can be used to sort and search through audio  image and video files 
for example  digital images could be embedded with digital watermarks that allow devices to classify or filter them in order to help parents better manage the media intake of their children  especially over the web 
remote triggering another potential application of digital watermarking is use as a trigger to make a playback device  such as a cell phone or a digital video recorder  perform an automatic action 
when images  audio files or video files are distributed or received  digital watermarks can signal these playback devices to display notification that the content is copyrighted  trip a download counter  or display additional related content and choices to consumers 
e commerce digimarc believes that digital watermarking could also be used to further enhance the consumer experience through improved electronic and mobile commerce applications 
for example  if a digitally watermarked song is played on a cell phone  a content id could be used to look up information about the artist or find other songs that can be purchased with the click of a button 
in such an application  digital watermarking has the potential to give consumers more choices  better access and faster delivery of the products and entertainment they want 
technology and intellectual property the company uses intellectual property ip to differentiate its products and technologies  mitigate infringement risk  and develop opportunities for licensing 
licensing of our digital watermarking and related technologies is supported by a broad patent portfolio covering a wide range of methods  applications  and system architectures 
most of our patents relate to various methods for embedding digital information in video  audio  and images  whether such content is rendered in analog or digital formats 
the digital information is generally embedded by making subtle modifications to the fundamental elements of the content itself  generally at a signal processing level 
the changes necessary to embed this information are so subtle that they are generally not noticeable by people during normal use 
because the message is carried by the content itself  it is file format independent 
the message generally survives most normal compression  edits  rotation  scaling  re sampling  file format transformations  copying  scanning and printing 
to protect our significant efforts in creating these technologies  we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions 
as a result  we believe we have established one of the world s most extensive patent portfolios in the field of digital watermarking  holding rights in the areas of digital watermarking  personal identification  and related technologies  with us and foreign issued patents and more than us and foreign patent applications on file as of december  separately  we own registered trademarks in both the us and other countries and have applied for other trademarks 
we continue to develop and broaden our portfolio of patented technologies  including digital watermarking and related applications and systems  and other technologies related to secure id systems 
for id systems related technologies  the focus of patent development has been in the areas of imaging and printing systems  card architecture and materials  and security features 
some patents relate to future offerings or related technologies like smart cards  laser engraving and alternative card systems 
although we devote significant resources to developing and protecting our technologies  and periodically evaluate potential competitors of our technologies for infringement of our intellectual property rights  these infringements may nonetheless go undetected or may arise in the future 
we expect that infringement claims may increase as companies become more concerned with protecting their content from electronic copying 
markets the company believes that the global market for secure identity management solutions is in the early adoption stage characterized by a fragmented supply chain with no dominant brands  emerging standards  and increasing concerns about national and economic security  entitlement programs  and requirements for controlling access to information and physical assets 
digimarc believes that us driver license revenues will continue to grow due to broadening use of the driver license as a secure credential beyond its traditional role as evidence of competence to drive a motor vehicle  technological innovation  desire among issuers to improve security and efficiency  and new governmental regulations such as the real id act 
we anticipate that these regulations will result in more opportunities for states to expand their existing driver license systems using federal dollars 
for example  congress has appropriated million for the fiscal year ending september  for grants to states to assist them in making necessary upgrades  and the us department of transportation has provided funding for pilot programs to demonstrate the utility of embedded data in a number of transportation safety scenarios 
the company is diligently pursuing these funding opportunities  working with customers who are writing grant proposals to upgrade and expand their operations 
for example  the real id act mandates certain changes in workflow and business rules 
several states are taking advantage of these changes to drive an upgrade of legacy mainframe applications  and are embarking on business process reengineering and mainframe migration or data center consolidation projects 
these data center moves  combined with the availability of federal dollars are drawing new competitors to the us dl market 
the industry model for the us dl market is characterized by long term contracts awarded through competitive bids to prime contractors who take full responsibility for delivery and maintenance of driver license issuance systems 
the retention rate for driver license customers is high 
the influx of grant money from the department of homeland security and the department of transportation for projects relating to compliance with the real id act  commercial driver license systems  and protection of the homeland may cause some changes in the procurement model  but we cannot predict the likelihood or outcome of those changes at this time 
we believe that many aspects of our driver license issuance solutions may have value in other forms of credentials and secure personal identification systems 
as the global market for secure personal identification solutions develops  the company believes that its position as the largest supplier of government issued citizen identification documents in the united states and mexico and its extensive investments in research and development provide a good foundation for participation in the global market for government programs in establishing the identities of citizens and issuing associated credentials 
the company s technology and ip have already established broad relevance  as they are used in various products and solutions affecting a variety of media objects  from movies and music  to banknotes and secure credentials 
our vision contemplates that the aggregation of these print and digital content markets creates an enormous overall opportunity for the company to address 
each media object enabled by the company s technology creates the potential for several applications  such as tracking and monitoring  authentication  anti counterfeiting  or linking to networks and enhanced services 
the company believes the market for digital watermarking applications is in the early stages of development and that existing solutions represent only a nominal portion of the potential market for digimarc s products  services  and technologies 
the company cannot provide reliable estimates of the size of these markets as of the date of this report 
competition digimarc competes for government business with system integrators  biometrics suppliers  security printers  card manufacturers  and smart card and other security technology suppliers  including companies like viisage biometrics  unisys system integration and de la rue security printer 
each of these companies is a supplier to us driver license issuers 
as us driver licenses gain utility as general credentials and the federal government is demanding higher security and a certain amount of standardization  the company expects increasing competition 
for instance  certain aspects of the real id act may expedite an existing trend toward cental issuance of driver licenses and smart card sc technologies 
while the company is proficient at central issuance  the possible acceleration of this trend could draw new competition from classic security printers such as canadian banknote cbn and giesieke devrient g d 
the possibility of including sc technologies in driver licenses is generating a great deal of public debate 
the sc industry is generally driven by european chip manufacturers such as infineon and axalto seeking to monetize investments to create contact and contactless microprocessor packages and embedded operating systems  as well as chips for memory cards 
while successful in bank cards  mobile phone sims and phone cards  smart cards have only recently begun to gain distribution as government issued credentials 
the us government is a strong advocate 
federal identity standards are embracing smart cards for the military  transportation workers  and government employees and contractors  and new epassports will carry a portrait in an on book chip 
despite considerable investment by the federal government  we believe no states have attempted or even piloted sc dls 
we understand that in recent years  at least two states have expressly considered and rejected sc dls 
emerging border control and federal traveler programs are considering sc concepts  but have not gained traction and face privacy issues 
the company anticipates that it will be prepared to support requirements from customers for sc technology if  and when  such requirements arise 
the company is seeing increased interest in the us market from large systems integrators such as eds  ibm global services  and bearing point 
smaller application providers are also emerging as point product competition  including covansys and archon 
internationally  digimarc supplies credentialing systems  components or supplies to numerous foreign governments  including two canadian provinces  latvia  mexico  colombia and russia 
competition in international markets  like in the us  comes from security printers  card producers  biometric companies and systems integrators  such as sagem  de la rue  gemplus  siemens nixdorf  unisys  and eds 
in all markets  digimarc s product and account strategy is intended to protect its existing customer base  continue to expand into accounts it does not presently service  and grow its business and workflow with existing customers 
the key to success is building a strong customer relationship  based on delivery of superior solutions  excellent service and profound understanding of customer needs 
in media and entertainment  digimarc and its business partners generally compete with application specific alternative technologies for the security budget of the producers and distributors of the media objects 
such alternatives include technologies and solutions based on encryption or on pattern recognition 
going forward  the company s competitive position within certain markets may be affected by factors such as inertia of the status quo and  positively or negatively  by changes in government regulations 
employees as of december  we had full time employees  including in sales  marketing  technical support and customer support  in research  development and engineering  in finance  administration  information technology and legal  and in field operations  manufacturing and supply chain 
we also had approximately contract workers at december  our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

item legal proceedings beginning in september  three purported class action lawsuits were commenced against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers by or on behalf of persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired our securities during the period from april  to july  these lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the district of oregon and were consolidated into one action for all purposes on december  on may   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
the complaint asserted claims under the federal securities laws  specifically sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  relating to our announcement that we had discovered errors in our accounting for software development costs and project capitalization and other project cost capitalization accounting practices  and that we likely would be required to restate our previously reported financial statements for full fiscal year and the first two quarters of specifically  the complaint alleged that we issued false and misleading financial statements and created a misperception regarding the profitability of the company in order to inflate the value of digimarc stock  which permitted insider sales of personal holdings at inflated values  and that we maintained insufficient accounting controls  which created an environment where improper accounting could be used to manipulate financial results 
the complaint sought unspecified damages 
on november   the court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to support their allegation that the defendants knowingly or recklessly acted in violation of the securities laws 
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on january  on february   we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs still fail to allege facts sufficient to support their allegation that the defendants knowingly or recklessly acted in violation of the securities laws 
this motion is pending 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the lawsuits are still at a preliminary stage  the ultimate outcome of the matter cannot be predicted 
on or about october   two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against certain of the company s officers and directors  naming the company as a nominal defendant  in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san luis obispo 
these lawsuits were consolidated into one action for all purposes on march  on july   the court granted the company s motion to stay these consolidated actions in favor of a shareholder derivative action to be filed by plaintiffs in the circuit court of the state of oregon for the county of washington 
on august   the california plaintiffs filed two new derivative lawsuits in the united states district court for the district of oregon 
on october   defendants filed a motion to dismiss these complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim 
this motion currently is pending 
separately  on november   a letter was mailed to the chairman of the company s board of directors by a law firm purporting to represent a shareholder of the company  demanding that the board commence a civil action against each of the directors and officers on behalf of the company to recover for damages alleged to have been incurred as a result of alleged breaches of fiduciary duties 
on or about april   this shareholder filed a purported shareholder derivative suit against certain of the company s officers and directors  naming the company as a nominal defendant  in the circuit court of the state of oregon for the county of washington 
on august   the individual defendants filed a motion to stay this state court derivative lawsuit  and on september   the court entered a stipulated order granting the motion and staying the case pending the outcome of an investigation by a committee appointed by the company s board of directors of the claims asserted in the demand letter and in the derivative lawsuits 
that stay expired on february   and defendants have until march  to respond to the complaints in this lawsuit 
these suits claim that certain of these officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the company s shareholders and to the company 
the complaints are derivative in nature and do not seek relief from the company 
the company s board of directors has appointed a committee to investigate the claims asserted in the demand letter and in the derivative lawsuits 
beginning in may  a number of substantially identical class action complaints alleging violations of the federal securities laws were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york naming approximately companies  including digimarc  certain of its officers and directors  and certain underwriters of the company s initial public offering as defendants 
the complaints have since been consolidated into a single action  and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in april the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the underwriters of the company s initial public offering violated securities laws by failing to disclose certain alleged compensation arrangements such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices in the company s initial public offering registration statement and by engaging in manipulative practices to artificially inflate the price of the company s stock in the after market subsequent to the company s initial public offering 
the company and certain of its officers and directors are named in the amended complaint pursuant to section of the securities act of  and section b and rule b of the securities exchange act of on the basis of an alleged failure to disclose the underwriters alleged compensation arrangements and manipulative practices 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages 
the individual officer and director defendants entered into tolling agreements and  pursuant to a court order dated october   were dismissed from the litigation without prejudice 
furthermore  in july  the company and the other defendants in the consolidated cases filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim 
the motion to dismiss claims under section was denied as to virtually all the defendants in the consolidated actions  including the company 
the claims against the company under section b  however  were dismissed 
in june  a committee of the company s board of directors conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this matter 
in june  an agreement of settlement was submitted to the court for preliminary approval 
the settlement would provide  among other things  a release of the company and of the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the amended complaint to be wrongful 
the company would agree to undertake other responsibilities under the partial settlement  including agreeing to assign away  not assert  or release certain potential claims the company may have against its underwriters 
any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement other than defense costs incurred and expensed prior to may  is expected to be borne by the company s insurers 
the court granted the preliminary approval motion on february   subject to certain modifications 
on august   the court issued a preliminary order further approving the modifications to the settlement and certifying the settlement classes 
the court also appointed the notice administrator for the settlement and ordered that notice of the settlement be distributed to all settlement class members beginning on november  and completed by january  the settlement fairness hearing has been set for april  following the hearing  if the court determines that the settlement is fair to the class members  the settlement will be approved 
there can be no assurance that this proposed settlement will be approved and implemented in its current form  or at all 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and because the settlement approval process is at a preliminary stage  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the matter 
the company is subject from time to time to other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company has made significant progress in developing the market for digital watermarking in its first decade 
digimarc and its business partners have enabled digital watermarking to be deployed in billions of media objects including banknotes  government issued credentials  music  movies  photographs and other digital images  and television and radio broadcasts and hundreds of millions of digital devices around the world 
we anticipate future opportunities to license our digital watermarking patents for use in various applications and we view these potential opportunities as an important element of our long term shareholder value proposition 
at present  the greatest interest in digital watermarking is in the entertainment field 
the company and its business partners plan to continue efforts to propagate digital watermarking in music  movies  television and radio broadcasts  images and printed materials 
the majority of the major music labels are using digital watermarking solutions for forensic tracking of pre release music 
they are obtaining the tracking solutions directly from digimarc and from our licensees 
motion picture studios have begun following suit  using forensic tracking based on digital watermarking as part of increased piracy deterrence measures in the academy award screener program 
in the television business  three companies have licensed our patents either directly or through sublicenses and deployed monitoring systems to track radio and television programs and advertisements in major media markets around the world 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced new license agreements with thomson and with dolby and its cinea subsidiary two of the leading providers of digital watermarking solutions designed to improve the management  distribution and protection of digital media content  including digital cinema 
certain other market developments are encouraging for our strategy as well 
the influx of imaging in mobile devices mainly cell phones and pdas is inspiring a renewed interest in digital watermarking as the means of linking printed materials to internet services  an initiative that we launched in we believe that a highly supportive change in market dynamics is underway 
a number of companies  ranging from start ups to industry leaders nokia and ntt have announced initiatives aimed at using various signaling means  including bar codes  rfid  and digital watermarking to simplify the user interface for mobile device access to internet services 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our resources and capital in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology  and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we incurred significant losses from inception through the fiscal year ended december  and during and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to invest significant financial and management resources in the acquisition and development of new government customers and in the development of new market opportunities for digital watermarking 
products and services the scope of proprietary technologies supporting the company s products  services and licensing is getting broader  expanding beyond digital watermarking  and deeper  as the number of digimarc s patents continues to grow 
digital watermarking remains at the heart of the business  as a strategic component of nearly all of the company s product offerings 
it has already proven to be a powerful differentiator in banknote security  giving rise to a long term relationship with an international consortium of leading central banks 
we are working to develop a similar success in secure identity management systems 
as of the end of  the technology is under contract to be deployed by state dl issuers  representing more than of the annual us driver license issuance volume  and one foreign issuer 
the united states department of transportation provided a grant to digimarc to pilot improvements in traffic safety through the authentication of driver licenses using digital watermarking based security features 
working with the state of nebraska  the project included pilots with law enforcement and the retail sale of age controlled products  demonstrating valuable applications to enhance citizen and traffic safety 
with respect to secure id systems  we have obtained extensions and upgrades from a number of government customers in  including a long term contract with substantial upgrades in texas  contract term extensions in california and kansas  and a new idvs contracts in massachusetts 
in foreign markets  we entered into an agreement  funded by the organization for american states oas  to produce more than million voter id cards for use in the recent haitian election 
this was the first ever photo identification card for haitian citizens 
we produced these cards in our secure factories in mexico 
in addition  we won contract awards for the issuance of voter id cards in yemen and liberia  and continued to produce voter id cards for mexico and to provide card consumables  maintenance and operations support for ongoing projects in the united kingdom the uk  latvia  russia  botswana  lesotho  philippines and new zealand 
in february  the uk driver vehicle licensing agency dvla awarded digimarc a contract extension to june  with an estimated value of million  to provide card consumables  maintenance and operations support for production of the uk driver license 
the dvla has entered into a contract with a consortium led by ibm to implement a new driver license system 
implementation of the replacement system is running behind schedule  but is expected to begin producing licenses sometime in the second half of the company continues to market its products and services for possible use in the new system 
however  there can be no assurance that digimarc will have a continuing role in the production of uk driver licenses after the replacement system is implemented 
we are seeing an increasing recognition of the broad security value of the driver license in the us and are encouraged by developments such as the real id act and congress recent appropriation of million in federal funding in the fiscal year ending september  for grants to states to assist them in making necessary upgrades to their driver license systems 
the availability of funding from the department of homeland security for pilot programs is dependent on the states ability to present a plan consistent with achieving real id compliance in we believe that our newest products idvs and idmarc will enable us to compete effectively for upgrades and add on business that may result from the heightened importance of security features in us dls 
we also anticipate opportunities to win new business in several foreign markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  warranties  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets  inventory valuation  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  and contingencies and litigation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term service contracts we recognize revenue on long term identification and driver license production contracts using primarily a price per card method 
we use actual monthly volume amounts  if available  or we estimate the card production volume on a monthly basis for certain of these contracts in order to recognize revenue earned during the period 
in the case of estimates  when the actual production information becomes available  which is typically within four weeks  we bill the customer accordingly and any differences from the estimates are recognized in the month the billing occurs 
these amounts represent our best estimates of cards produced and are based on historical trends  known events during the period  and discussions with contract representatives 
prior to publicly reporting results  our practice is to compare the actual production volumes to estimated production volumes and adjust revenue amounts as necessary 
revisions to our estimates have been less than of total revenue in every period reported in  and any estimated amounts are included in unbilled receivables on the balance sheet until the actual production information is available and the billing occurs 
any estimation process involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to production estimation through our approval and monitoring processes related to accounting estimates 
we also evaluate contracts for multiple elements and account for these items under the appropriate accounting literature 
revenue from professional services arrangements is generally determined based on time and material or a cost plus a profit margin measure 
revenue for professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided for in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
billing for services rendered generally occurs within one month following when the services are provided 
revenue earned which has not been invoiced is classified as unbilled trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets we periodically assess long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
if our estimates of projected future cash flows were too high by  we believe there would be no material impact on the reported value of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  we periodically review the useful lives of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life may have changed 
if the estimated useful lives of such assets do change  we adjust the depreciation or amortization period to a shorter or longer period  based on the circumstances identified 
inventory valuation inventory consists primarily of consumable supplies that are used in the production of driver licenses and products held for resale to customers 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value which lower amount is the net realizable value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and current information 
we review  and adjust when appropriate  our allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if our estimate of uncollectible accounts were too low by  we believe there would be no material impact on the reported value of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies and litigation we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies or commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  then such loss is accrued and charged to operations 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to sfas no 
are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we will disclose the nature of the contingency and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 
stock based compensation the company has various stock based compensation plans  including stock incentive plans and an employee stock purchase plan

 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
generally  under apb opinion no 
 stock based compensation expense is recognized only for stock awards granted with an exercise price below fair market value on the date of grant 
on december   the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of the company s outstanding stock options with option exercise prices equal to or greater than 
the acceleration applies to all options outstanding as of december  under the company s restated stock incentive plan and non officer employee stock incentive plan  except for options held by members of the company s board of directors 
options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  or of the company s total outstanding options  with a weighted average exercise price of and varying remaining vesting schedules  are subject to this acceleration and become immediately vested and exercisable as of december  of these  options   options are held by the company s executive officers 
as a result of this acceleration  the company reduced its exposure to the effects of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the company to recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method for periods beginning after december  the incremental pro forma expense as a result of the acceleration was  this amount represents our best estimate of the reduced exposure under sfas r with respect to this acceleration 
on december   the audit  compensation and corporate governance committees of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of the company s outstanding stock options with option exercise prices greater than 
the acceleration applied to all options outstanding under the company s restated stock incentive plan and non officer employee stock incentive plan that would not have otherwise vested in full by june  in accordance with their terms 
the effective date of the vesting acceleration is december  the exercise price was selected because it was higher than i the price at which the company s stock had traded during the period prior to the announcement of the restatement of prior financial results  ii the average trading price of the company s common stock for the last two years  and iii the purchase price per share of the company s common stock in the company s private placement in august options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  or of the total number of options of the company outstanding as of december  with remaining vesting schedules  were accelerated 
accelerating the vesting of the company s options prior to the time at which these new accounting changes become effective accelerates the recognition of any remaining expense calculated under statement associated with these options 
no additional compensation expense was recorded in the statement of operations as the options that were accelerated had an exercise price greater than the fair market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of the modification 
the incremental pro forma expense as a result of the acceleration was  this amount represents our best estimate of the reduced exposure under sfas r with respect to this acceleration 
of these  options  approximately  options are held by the company s executive officers 
other than the company s chairman and chief executive officer  no director of the company holds any options subject to the acceleration 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended december  revenue service product and subscription total revenue cost of revenue service product and subscription total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative amortization of intangibles intellectual property total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other total other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended december  and revenue twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease revenue service product and subscription total revenue as of total revenue service product and subscription total total revenue increased million from to the increase resulted primarily from additional government programs added in late and early  such as florida  alabama  mexico  latvia and ohio that were either at or near full production by the end of service 
service revenue consists primarily of card revenues from government issued credentials that are produced with our issuance systems and billed and recognized on a price per card basis  software development services  and hardware and software maintenance 
the majority of service revenue arrangements are typically structured as price per card product agreements  time and materials consulting agreements  or fixed price consulting agreements 
the million increase in service revenue was primarily due to issuance revenue from new programs for mexico and latvia  which started generating revenue in the second quarter of  florida  which started in the third quarter of  ohio  which started in the first quarter of  and alabama  which started in the second quarter of  offset partially by contracts that ended and contracts that converted to consumable sales 
product and subscription 
product and subscription revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of equipment and consumables related to government issued credential issuance systems  patent and software licensing  and subscriptions related to various software products 
the million decrease in product and subscription revenue was primarily related to the timing of large non recurring sales to domestic and foreign customers that occurred in  partially offset by smaller non recurring sales to domestic and foreign customers that occurred in based on projected government issued credential production volumes and other commitments we have for the periods under contract with our respective customers  we anticipate our current contracts as of december  will generate approximately million in revenue during the next seven years 
we expect approximately million of this amount to be recognized as revenue during this amount includes production volumes reasonably expected to be achieved under currently effective contracts  government orders that are firm but not yet funded  and government contracts awarded but not yet signed 
backlog as of december  was million 
factors that lead to increased backlog include competitive bid wins  renewals with current customers  add on sales to current customers  and contracts with longer contractual periods replacing contracts with shorter contractual periods 
factors that lead to decreased backlog are recognition of revenue associated with backlog currently in place  periods following low bid activity  contracts with shorter contractual periods replacing contracts with longer contractual periods  customers extending or renewing contracts on a year to year basis  and the revenue model utilized for a particular customer eg  a price per card model with a large associated backlog vs 
a hardware and consumables model with a small associated backlog 
the mix of these factors  among others  dictates whether our backlog increases or decreases for any given period 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we received notice of a competitive bid win and an extension  which added approximately million to our backlog 
over the next year or so  we anticipate several states may request bids on their driver license issuance system programs 
if this results in unusually high bid activity and we are successful with our bids  backlog could grow significantly  particularly if we acquire new accounts through competitive wins 
on the other hand  two of our recent domestic driver license issuance system contracts did not follow the prevailing industry price per card model  but were structured instead as hardware and consumable sales 
although such sales are positive growth indicators for our business  they can lead to lower reported backlog 
likewise  when our customers choose not to open a contract renewal for competitive bid because of high satisfaction and instead renew our contract on a sole source basis typically  one to three years  our backlog may decline because the renewal terms may be shorter than typical initial terms typically  five years following competitive bids 
there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period  because the orders  awards and contracts included in our backlog may be subject to modification  cancellation or suspension 
we may not realize revenue on certain contracts  orders or awards included in our backlog or the timing of such recognition may change 
twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease revenue by geography domestic international total revenue as of total revenue domestic international total in non us markets  where we provide driver license  national identification  and voter identification systems  services  and components in partnership with local card producers  security printers  system integrators  and others  we may be responsible for delivering hardware  software  or consumables to the prime contractor  whereas  in the united states where we generally service as prime contractor  we are responsible for integrating the components of the system to the customer s specifications 
international revenue in was essentially the same as in because incremental issuance revenue from mexico and latvia largely offset a one time sales of products that occurred in international sales for us have typically taken the form of an outright sale of equipment and or consumables to non us government agencies or their prime contractors 
these sales often can be large  carry relatively low margins and may cause noticeable spikes in quarterly revenue and variations in gross profit trends 
we enter into such contracts from time to time to maintain market presence and customer and partner relationships  as such programs often transition to more profitable digital technologies over time 
due to the nature of such international programs and customers  the timing of these sales is somewhat less predictable than are service revenues provided by domestic customers and  consequently  international sales can occur unevenly during the course of a year 
we believe that international growth opportunities exist for us and we expect to continue to invest in personnel and resources to support our potential revenue growth outside of the us we had no customer that accounted for more than of our revenue in  or cost of revenue twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease cost of revenue service product and subscription total cost of revenue as of related revenue components service product and subscription the cost of service revenue primarily includes costs of consumables used in delivering a service  compensation for software developers  quality assurance personnel  product managers  field operations personnel  business development personnel and outside contractors  depreciation charges for machinery  equipment and capitalized software  deployment costs used specifically for service delivery  provisions for obsolete and excess inventories  travel costs directly attributable to service and development contracts  and charges for infrastructure and centralized costs 
the million increase was primarily the result of higher consumables and general support costs related to the higher revenue identified above  higher depreciation on revenue generating assets  increased costs to deliver support and maintenance for new and existing programs  and increased freight costs related to higher shipping activity  partially offset by lower charges for inventory reserves 
the cost of product and subscription revenue primarily includes compensation for operations personnel  costs of consumables sold to third parties  costs of machinery sold to third parties  and internet service provider connectivity charges and image search data fees to support the services offered to our subscription customers 
the million decrease was a combination of lower revenues and lower costs on the revenue mix 
gross profit twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease gross profit service product and subscription total gross profit as of related revenue components service product and subscription total the million decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was largely for the reasons stated above under the cost of revenue section 
the costs included in our cost of revenue are comprised of three categories as described below twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease cost of revenue variable fixed field support and manufacturing program depreciation total cost of revenue as of total revenue variable fixed field support and manufacturing program depreciation total as a percentage of revenue  we have experienced a slight reduction in our variable costs to deliver incremental revenue 
such costs include the price of materials and labor to produce an identification card  direct costs of hardware and software delivered and other costs having a variable component to our costs 
the improvement relates to continued pricing improvement with vendors and improved yields during the manufacturing process 
fixed field support and manufacturing is a category that includes field operations  field support  manufacturing  and supply chain costs 
these costs are considered fixed with respect to supporting current contracts 
as new contracts are entered into and delivered  the overall level of fixed costs increases 
the increase in fixed costs are primarily due to newer contracts requiring additional headcount as well as travel costs to support them 
program depreciation showed the largest increase of the three components of cost of revenue 
this element of cost consists of amortization and depreciation of costs incurred during the delivery process  where such costs are capitalized and then amortized or depreciated over the life of the useful lives of the assets to which the costs relate 
the current higher fixed costs as a percentage of revenue are a result of a several factors 
the primary factor relates to some new programs involving competitive wins  where we have provided a complete system replacement using advanced technologies 
these programs have recently been completed and transitioned from deployment to revenue production  and thus are now affecting margins 
these installations were particularly challenging for us  representing a stretch in terms of scope from our historical system deliveries 
we were successful in delivering these programs  but at higher costs than have been customary 
in one other case  we bid a program aggressively as part of a broader market development strategy that we believe will yield good long term performance 
the fixed costs for these systems  which include amortization and depreciation of costs capitalized during the delivery process as well as field service and operational costs to manage and maintain them  are higher than average and  thus  reduce reported margins 
we anticipate that we will be able to improve margins in these accounts over time and earn a good return on investment over the life of the account relationship 
we have observed seasonality in the production of driver license issuances and corresponding revenue in the united states  with larger volumes in the second and third quarter of  and generally lower volumes in the first and fourth quarters 
the fourth quarter is usually the seasonally lowest quarter each year 
we use the straight line method of depreciation and amortization for program related assets 
the combination of seasonality and straight line depreciation and amortization can cause significant variations in quarterly gross margin trends  generally increasing margins as a percentage of revenue in the second and third quarters of and decreasing margins as a percentage of revenue in the first and fourth quarters of  while having a neutral effect on a yearly basis 
we are engaged in ongoing study of the predictability of seasonal trends and the productivity of program assets and and are evaluating potential changes in our depreciation and amortization methods and estimates to more closely match costs to the useful lives of program assets and seasonality in our business 
operating expenses sales and marketing twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease sales and marketing sales and marketing as of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of sales and marketing employees  product managers and sales engineers  as well as recruiting  travel  market research  costs associated with marketing programs  such as trade shows  public relations and new product launches  and charges for infrastructure and centralized costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million resulted primarily from the following employee compensation related expenses for salaries  benefits  recruiting costs  and incentive plans increased million due to personnel mix for higher level focus on marketing and governmental activities  and higher benefit program costs  an increase in bids and proposals work of million  an increase in presence at tradeshows  advertising  consulting fees and event sponsorship of approximately million  partially offset by an impairment charge of million taken in with no such charge in related to investments in companies licensed to market our digital watermarking technology 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at approximately the current run rate of dollars in sales and marketing in the near term while working to moderate spending in the longer term 
research  development and engineering twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease research  development and engineering research  development and engineering as of total revenue research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of software developers and quality assurance personnel and payments to outside contractors  the purchase of materials and services for product development  primarily in the card systems area  and charges for infrastructure and centralized costs 
the increase in research  development and engineering expenses of million resulted primarily from the following employee compensation related expenses for salaries  benefits  recruiting costs  and incentive plans increased million due to personnel mix for higher level focus on government program activities  and higher benefit program costs  offset by a decrease in contract labor of million as we transitioned contractors to full time employee status  change in the application of resources from capital projects to research activities which are expensed of million to enhance existing products  develop new products  and focus on requirements of the recently passed real id act  increased consulting and professional fees of million for various projects  and increased allocated infrastructure and centralized costs of million 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest at approximately the current run rate of dollars in research and development in the near term while working to moderate spending in the longer term 
general and administrative twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease general and administrative general and administrative as of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and related costs of executive  finance and administrative personnel  legal  human resources and other professional fees  and charges for infrastructure and centralized costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million resulted primarily from the following increased headcount and change in skills mix to address enhanced governance and internal controls drove up employee related expenses such as salaries  benefits  recruiting costs  and incentive plans by million  audit and consulting fees increased million primarily related to our year end audit  restatement work  sarbanes oxley audit  and finance staff expansion  increased software expense of million related to continued licensing costs and software upgrades  and  increased stock based compensation of million related to restricted stock 
we anticipate that we will invest below our current run rate of dollars in general and administrative in the near term 
we are examining means to gain efficiencies to reduce general and administrative spending as a percentage of revenue in the longer term 
amortization of intangible assets twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles as of total revenue we recorded a customer relationship intangible asset from the lgp acquisition 
the accounting for this intangible asset is done in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement nos 
 business combinations and  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements require the recording of intangible assets under purchase accounting rules  and require the amortization of such intangible assets over their expected useful life 
as a result  in december we recorded million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities from polaroid and affiliates 
these intangible assets were set up to amortize over a year period  representing the expected useful life at the date of the acquisition 
changes in contract status and customer relationships may lengthen or shorten the expected useful life of such intangible assets  or cause an impairment charge related to the intangible asset  so some variability is expected to exist related to intangibles depending on internal and external factors 
amortization expense increased in due to the loss of certain contracts with relatively high intangible balances  and the reassessment of useful lives for certain international customers 
the estimated amortization of intangibles over the next five years is as follows amortization of intangibles intellectual property twelve months ended percent december  increase decrease intellectual property intellectual property as of total revenue the intellectual property costs primarily consist of employee related expenses such as salaries  benefits  recruiting costs  and incentive plans as well as costs associated with documenting  applying for  and maintaining patents 
the decrease of million was primarily due to consulting fees paid to third party attorneys related to patent work in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense relates to restricted stock granted in  as described below  is based on the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date the restricted stock was granted measurement date  and is being recognized over the four year vesting period of the related restricted stock using the straight line method 
the expense was recorded in the respective statement of operations expense categories for the employees to which it applies  as set forth in the table below 
twelve months ended december  sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative on december   the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
in addition  companies must recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
the effective date for this pronouncement is for the next fiscal year beginning after december  the company has adopted sfas r effective january  the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and it has not determined whether adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas total other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest received and paid 
the relatively flat difference resulted from lower average cash balances and higher average interest rates during the majority of fiscal provision for income taxes 
due to the company s domestic losses for the years ended december   and there was no provision for federal or state income taxes 
as the company was profitable in some foreign jurisdictions during  and we provided for income taxes expected to be paid on our international operations 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal  state and foreign income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and research and experimentation credits of approximately million which expire through if not utilized 
approximately million of the net operating losses is related to the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and thus will be allocated to contributed capital if subsequently recognized 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including a change of more than in ownership 
years ended december  and revenue for was up from the prior year 
revenue related to services  which include the issuance of driver licenses  increased by approximately while revenue related to product and subscription sales increased approximately because of delivery of a large  international film based system to a customer  the sale of equipment to a domestic customer  and the license and related revenues for intellectual property rights to international customers 
operating expenses in total increased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the majority of the increase came from the general and administrative function as a result of several factors 
one such factor was the cost related to the restatement activities we were undertaking during  which included legal  accounting  and consulting fees 
a second factor is the increased cost of our efforts to document  evaluate  and test our internal controls in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act of we also had increased costs related to impairment charges  litigation settlement charges  increased bad debt expense  charges for vacating our old building  and increased costs related to higher financial staffing and consulting fees 
our sales and marketing and research  development  and engineering costs increased only slightly 
as of the end of  we increased the number of our full time employees by and increased the number of our contractors by since the end of the increased workforce resulted from the high demand of delivery programs during the year and increased resources for our finance group 
we had a net loss of million compared to our net income of  in the decrease in net income came as a result of a decrease in margins of million and an increase in operating expenses of million  as described above 
revenue twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease revenue service product and subscription total revenue as of total revenue service product and subscription total the million increase in total revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our product and subscription revenues 
twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease revenue by geography domestic international total revenue as of total revenue domestic international total the million increase in service revenue was the result of increased issuance revenue from program transitions the addition of programs based in mexico  florida  and latvia offset by the loss of programs based in oklahoma  alaska and maryland  in addition to increased services provided under our long term contract with the international consortium of central banks 
the million increase in product and subscription revenue was primarily related to the delivery of a large  international film based system to a customer  the sale of equipment to a domestic customer  and the license and related revenues for intellectual property rights to international customers 
cost of revenue twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease cost of revenue service product and subscription total cost of revenue as of related revenue components service product and subscription the million increase in service cost of revenue was primarily the result of increased international operations costs of million  an increase of program related depreciation costs of million  and an increase of million in domestic field operations costs  inventory and program asset charges of million related to excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory  partially offset by a decrease of million related to costs of consumables related to issuances and additional allocated infrastructure and centralized costs of million 
in  we began to outsource much of our field operations and maintenance activities on new contracts to third parties  and therefore the increase in spending is not the result of the increase in the total number of our full time employees during we were active in negotiating volume discounts  decreasing storage costs  and consolidating operations when necessary among other actions 
field operations employees totaled and at december  and  respectively 
the million increase in product and subscription cost of revenue was primarily the result of increased material costs in connection with the delivery of the large international film based system to one customer during the year ended december  this large delivery had particularly low margins 
we also sold quantities of older or expiring film and equipment to a domestic customer at low margins or no margin during the year which drove up costs and reduced margins for the period 
gross profit twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease gross profit service product and subscription total gross profit as of related revenue components service product and subscription total the million decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily related to the following factors inventory and program asset charges of million related to excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory  increased international operations costs of million related to the ramp up of two large new programs  increased domestic field operations costs of million  an unfavorable revenue mix during the first half of the year  including low margin revenues from follow on film sales into an international voter identification project and some domestic equipment sales  cost overruns related to the sale of a driver license issuance system in the first half of the year  and higher depreciation charges of million originating from the capitalized costs related to hardware  software  and delivery activities in the deployment of new contracts and upgrades to existing contracts 
these items were partially offset by a decrease of million related to costs on consumables related to issuances 
the costs included in our cost of sales are comprised of three categories as described below twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease cost of revenue variable fixed field support and manufacturing program depreciation total cost of revenue as of total revenue variable fixed field support and manufacturing program depreciation total in particular  the high level of new programs exerted operational pressures on our identification systems business during as the organization incurred higher expenses as part of the upfront implementation costs associated with making these new programs operational 
operating expenses sales and marketing twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease sales and marketing sales and marketing as of total revenue sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat for the year due primarily to lower headcount for sales and marketing employees and spending controls offset by increased impairment charges of approximately million related to investments in private  technology related companies 
starting in  we reduced many of the overhead and variable costs within sales and marketing by consciously making strategic spending decisions 
these efforts resulted in targeted spending for critical areas  yielding lower overall spending within the function 
sales and marketing employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
research  development and engineering twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease research  development and engineering research  development and engineering as of total revenue the overall increase in research  development and engineering expenses of million resulted from higher headcounts  partially offset by cost control measures taken by us during and  such as restructuring the business  consolidating operations  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
research  development and engineering personnel totaled and as of december  and  respectively general and administrative twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease general and administrative general and administrative as of total revenue the overall increase in general and administrative expenses of million primarily resulted from incremental third party legal and accounting costs related to our restatement activities of million  incremental costs related to third party services in support of our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of of million  incremental charges related to the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and uncollectible notes receivable of million  incremental charges related to the settlement of litigation of million  incremental facility costs of million due to dual rent costs for four months in addition to increased amortization and depreciation on the facility build out  offset by a decrease by million in stock based compensation related to stock based employee compensation arrangements 
the remaining million of the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of increases in headcount  consulting fees and other general costs related to compliance and administrative activities 
in addition  we added headcount and consulting resources to our infrastructure  including our finance and information technology groups  in order to meet the normal responsibilities of these functions in addition to the increased demands of our restatement and ongoing compliance activities 
general and administrative employees totaled and as of december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles as of total revenue we account for intangible assets resulting from acquisitions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement nos 
 business combinations and  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements require the recording of intangible assets under purchase accounting rules  and require the amortization of such intangible assets over their expected useful life 
as a result  in december we recorded million of intangible assets related to the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities from polaroid and affiliates 
these intangible assets were set up to amortize over a year period  representing the expected useful life 
changes in contract status and customer relationships may lengthen or shorten the expected useful life of such intangible assets  or cause an impairment charge related to the intangible asset  so some variability is expected to exist related to intangibles depending on internal and external factors 
the change resulted from extensions of certain useful lives during and the completion of accelerated amortization in late and early intellectual property 
twelve months ended december  percent increase decrease intellectual property intellectual property as of total revenue the increase of million was primarily due to consulting fees paid to third party attorneys related to patent work 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements 
stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock on the date of grant  and is being recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years 
no stock based compensation expense was recorded in while million was recorded for the year ended december   and is included in the respective statements of operations expense categories for the employees to which it applies  as set forth in the table below 
twelve months ended december  sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative total other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest received and paid 
other income expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase came as a result of higher average cash balances that originated from the private placement offering in the third quarter of and higher interest rates during the majority of fiscal provision for income taxes 
for the years ended december  and  the company was profitable in some foreign jurisdictions 
therefore  during and we provided for income taxes expected to be paid on our international operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  representing a decrease of million from million at december  as of december   million of cash and cash equivalents is restricted as a result of the requirements of performance bonds that we are obligated to maintain in connection with some of our long term contracts in our secure id systems business 
we support the performance bonds with letters of credit  which may or may not require restricted cash 
the letters of credit must be renewed yearly if they are expected to continue  and therefore the need for restricted cash is renewed yearly 
however  our banks have required us to restrict this cash until we return to profitability for one year 
accordingly  restricted cash is classified as a non current asset 
working capital at december  was million  compared to working capital of million at december  the majority of the decrease in cash and working capital primarily relates to investments made in the florida  mexico  and alabama programs that we anticipate will contribute to revenue growth in and beyond 
operating cash flow 
the million of cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted from net loss of million which includes non cash items related to depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation aggregating to million 
items positively impacting operating cash flow were decreases in restricted cash of million and in inventory of million  and increases in deferred revenue of million and in accrued payroll and related costs of million 
negatively impacting operating cash flow was an increase in trade and unbilled accounts receivable  net of million and in other current assets of million  along with a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the million of cash provided by operations for the year ended december  resulted from net loss of million which includes non cash items related to depreciation and amortization of million

we also acquired approximately million of fixed assets during through capital lease arrangements 
the million of cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to million for the purchase of property and equipment  including capitalized labor costs  partially offset by in net sales of short term investments 
we also acquired approximately million of fixed assets during through capital lease arrangements 
financing cash flow 
the million of cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to million of principal payments under capital leases  offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock for million related to the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the million of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily related to the issuance of stock for million related to the employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  offset by million of principal payments under capital leases 
commitments and contingencies 
our significant commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases  which totaled million as of december   and are payable in monthly installments through october our obligations under non cancelable capital leases  which totaled million as of december   are payable in monthly installments through we are contractually obligated to make the following payments as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period in s less than more than total year years years years capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations we have driver license contracts with various jurisdictions that are not yet fully deployed for which we have estimated the amounts to complete 
in order to complete these contracts  we estimate we will incur approximately million of expenditures 
the estimates are derived from information known to the company at the time the estimates were prepared 
actual expenditures may vary from our estimates 
these expenditures are recouped through receipts from the long term price per card agreements 
our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures may constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we expect that we will continue to utilize cash in the upcoming few quarters 
we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
the company from time to time experiences delays in identification system implementation  timely acceptance for identification systems programs  concerns regarding identification system program performance  and other contractual disputes 
customers have asserted  and may in the future assert  compensatory or liquidated damages  breach of contract  or other claims alleging that we have failed to meet timing or other delivery requirements and milestones pursuant to the terms of such contracts 
from time to time  customers have given notice of their intention to assert claims for liquidated damages 
management believes that these assertions are part of the resolution process involving commercial disagreements over the delivery terms of these contracts 
such disputes are not uncommon and tend to be resolved over time 
to date  we have not paid any material contractual damages in connection with a customer dispute 
while there is always risk that damages could be assessed in the future  management cannot predict  as of december   whether any material damages will be imposed in the future or what the amount of any such damages would be if they were to be imposed 
however  our failure to meet contractual milestones or other performance requirements as promised  or to successfully resolve customer disputes  could result in our having to incur liability for damages  as well as increased costs  lower margins  or compensatory obligations in addition to other losses  such as harm to our reputation 
such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we anticipate that future contracts will continue to have such provisions unless and until industry practices change 
future cash expectations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
in addition  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in which will fund a large portion of our capital needs 
thereafter  we anticipate continuing to use cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances to satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we have taken and continue to take steps to manage our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenues 
these steps include  among other things  considering and or taking steps  as needed  to restructure our business  consolidating our operations  negotiating volume pricing with vendors  centralizing certain services  and standardizing products 
our operating expense levels  including research  development  engineering  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  depend on anticipated business activity levels 
while research  development  engineering and marketing expenses are based on anticipated investment levels in technology development  product development and market development activities  the appropriate expense levels in selling  general and administrative expenses are dependent on the level of infrastructure required to support our anticipated business volume 
we review our business plans periodically to determine the appropriate level of such expenses based on various business factors 
in the past we have taken appropriate measures to control our expenses based on business circumstances 
in the future we will continue to review our business plans from time to time and make appropriate changes to our expense levels  as we have in the past  to reduce operating expenses where it is advantageous to do so to improve operational efficiencies 
in order to take advantage of opportunities  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity financing  debt financing  or credit facilities 
however  we do not believe at this time that our long term working capital and capital expenditures would require us to take steps to remedy any such potential deficiencies 
as an example  in the event that we were to win contracts requiring significant capital investment  we may need to seek additional financing 
if it were necessary to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  we may not be able to do so  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

we do not intend to update any forward looking statements as a result of future events or developments 
factors affecting forward looking statements our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors  including the factors set forth below 
given our history of losses  we cannot guarantee sustained profitability  particularly if we were to lose large contracts 
we incurred significant net losses from inception through the fiscal year ended december   and during and our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
in order to attain sustained profitability  we will need to generate higher revenue than we have in prior years while controlling expenditures 
achieving profitability will depend upon a variety of factors  including the impact of new financial accounting mandates requiring us to expense stock options  as well as expenses related to litigation and other proceedings that have arisen as a result of our prior year restatement 
in addition  we evaluate our strategy and market opportunities on an ongoing basis and will adjust our approach to market conditions that prevail from time to time 
accordingly  in the short term we may focus more on growing our revenue and taking advantage of market opportunities than an immediate return to profitability 
finally  various adverse developments including the loss of large contracts or cost overruns on our existing contracts could have a negative impact on our revenue or our margins 
accordingly  increases in our expenses may not be offset by revenue increases and as a result we may not be able to regain and or sustain profitability 
the loss of any large contract may result in loss of revenue and potential acceleration of amortization expense or impairment of intangible assets 
contracts between government agencies and digimarc have varying duration  generally five or more years in length 
some contracts we enter into contain cancellation clauses 
in addition  after a contract period expires  generally the government agency can re open the contract for competitive bidding 
if we were to lose a contract due to cancellation or in a competitive bidding situation  then  in addition to the loss of revenue and margin on a prospective basis  we could also incur accelerated amortization expense or impairment of intangible assets related to the customer  which could adversely affect our financial results 
the company has not experienced the early termination of any driver license issuance contracts and is not aware of any early terminations of such contracts of its competitors 
the market for our products is highly competitive  and as a result  alternative technologies or larger companies may undermine  limit or eliminate the market for our products technologies  which would decrease our revenue and profits 
the markets in which we compete for business are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to continue from both existing competitors and new market entrants 
we face competition from other companies and from alternative technologies 
the potential for an influx of federal funds into our core us driver license market is likely to draw new competition 
as we expand the applications for our technologies  we will experience more competition from products and services that are substitutes for our applications 
because our digital watermarking business is new and emerging  we also may face competition from unexpected sources 
alternative technologies that may directly or indirectly compete with particular applications of our watermarking technologies include encryption securing data during distribution using a secret code so it cannot be accessed except by authorized users  containers inserting a media object in an encrypted wrapper  which prevents the media object from being duplicated and is used for content distribution and transaction management  dataglyphs a slightly visible modification of the characteristics of an image or document that is machine readable  scrambled indicia an optical refraction based data hiding technique that is inserted into an image and can be read with a lens  traditional anti counterfeiting technologies a number of solutions used currently by many governments and that compete for budgetary outlays designed to deter counterfeiting  including optically sensitive ink  magnetic threads and other materials used in the printing of currencies  radio frequency tags embedding a chip that emits a signal when in close proximity with a receiver  which is being used in photo identification credentials  labels and tags  internet technologies numerous existing and potential internet access and search methods are competitive with the digimarc mediabridge system and the searching capabilities of digimarc imagebridge  digital fingerprints and signatures a metric  or metrics  computed solely from a source image or audio or video track  that can be used to uniquely identify an image or track  or authenticate the image or track  smart cards badges and cards including a semiconductor memory and or processor used for authentication and related purposes  and bar codes a data carrying code  typically visible in nature but invisible if printed in ultraviolet or infrared responsive inks 
in addition  as we more broadly apply our digital watermarking technologies to the internet through new commercial solutions applications  we may begin to compete with a wide range of other types of companies beyond those companies using digital watermarking technologies and alternative technologies 
we cannot assure you that digital watermarking technologies  and our products and services using these technologies  will gain widespread market acceptance 
new developments are expected to continue  and we cannot assure you that discoveries by others  including current and potential competitors  will not render our services and products noncompetitive 
moreover  because of rapid technological changes  we may be required to expend greater amounts of time and money than currently anticipated to develop new products and services  which in turn may necessitate us to require greater revenue streams on such products and services to cover developmental costs 
many of the companies that currently compete with us for some of our business  as well as other companies with whom we may compete in the future  are larger and national or international in scope and may have greater technical  financial  marketing  and political resources than we do 
these resources could enable these companies to initiate severe price cuts or take other measures in an effort to gain market share or otherwise impede our progress 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future participants in our market or against alternative technologies  nor can we assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not decrease our revenue and profits in the future 
our products could have unknown defects or errors  which may give rise to claims against us or divert application of our resources from other purposes 
products and systems as complex as those we offer or develop may contain undetected defects or errors 
furthermore  we often provide complex implementation  integration  customization  consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products 
despite testing  defects or errors in our products and services may occur  which could result in delays in the development and implementation of products and systems  inability to meet customer requirements or expectations in a timely manner  loss of revenue or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs  increased service and warranty costs and warranty or breach of contract claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from warranty or breach of contract claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements when we can  these contractual provisions are sometimes not included and may not be enforceable in every instance 
if a court refuses to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  the expense associated with defending such actions or paying the resultant claims could be significant 
if leading companies in our industry or standard setting bodies or institutions downplay  minimize  or reject the use of digital watermarking  its deployment may be slowed and we may be unable to achieve revenue growth particularly in the media and entertainment sector 
many of our business endeavors  such as our licensing of intellectual property in support of audio and video copy control applications  can be impeded or frustrated by larger  more influential companies or by standard setting bodies or institutions downplaying  minimizing or rejecting the value or use of watermarking technology or any of our other technologies 
such a negative position by these companies  bodies or institutions  if taken  may result in obstacles for us that we would be incapable of overcoming and may block or impede the adoption of digital watermarking particularly in the media and entertainment market 
in addition  potential customers in the media and entertainment industry may delay or reject initiatives that relate to deployment of digital watermarking 
such a development would make the achievement of our business objectives in this market difficult or impossible 
if we are unable to respond to regulatory or industry standards effectively  or if we are unable to develop and integrate new technologies effectively  our growth and the development of our products and services could be delayed or limited 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services in accordance with regulatory or industry standards 
our ability to remain competitive will depend in part on our ability to influence and respond to emerging industry and governmental standards  in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we are unable to influence these or other standards or respond to such standards effectively  our growth and the development of certain products and services could be delayed or limited 
our market is characterized by new and evolving technologies 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to develop and integrate new technologies effectively and address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of our customers in a timely and cost effective manner 
our ability to remain competitive will depend in part on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and other features of the products and services we offer or plan to offer  continue to develop our technical expertise  and develop and introduce new services  applications and technologies to meet changing customer needs and preferences and to integrate new technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding to these technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we are unable to develop or integrate new technologies effectively or respond to these changing needs  our margins could decrease  and our release of new products and services and the deployment of our watermarking technology could be adversely affected 
we expect our secure id systems business to experience variability in gross margins 
we are likely to experience variability in gross margins on our government contracts due to numerous factors  including  among other things  the following delays in project implementation  failure to achieve add on sales to existing customers  governmental regulation of credentials and issuance policies  private sector usage trends for driver licenses and other credentials  level of commodity vs 
proprietary components applicable to customer system specifications  whether contracts have been extended or renewed  and the amount of capital expenditure associated with such extension or renewal  price competition in competitive bids  contract renewals and contract extensions  variations in costs of materials and manufacturing  varying levels of efficiency of our workforce in delivering  implementing  and servicing contracts  seasonality of issuance volumes  sales mix related to card issuance revenues compared to product sales  sales mix related to domestic sales compared to international sales  sales mix related to adoption of new products compared to sales of current products  strategic decisions on new business  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized project costs related to new or upgraded programs 
the numerous factors affecting gross margins make such margins complex and difficult to predict 
we are continually refining our predictive tools and increasing our understanding of what drives these various factors 
for reasons such as those listed above  we expect that there will be fluctuations in our future operating results as a result of the variability in margins from period to period in the secure id systems business 
the majority of our revenue is subject to government procurement processes that may involve unpredictable delays and other unexpected changes which might limit our actual revenue in any given quarter 
we derive substantial portions of our revenue from government contracts which are subject to periodic open  competitive bids 
the timing of such bids is solely within the discretion of the governmental authority 
consequently  large components of new revenue are tied to procurement schedules  which could shift as the needs of the related government procurement agencies change 
many of these governmental customers are facing continued budget pressures introducing added uncertainty 
in addition  the department of homeland security s initiatives in passports and border crossing cards  as well as delays in disbursement of funding for real id act projects  could create confusion within the us dl market that may delay purchase decisions by government customers 
any shift in the government procurement process  which is outside our control and may not be predictable  could result in delays in bookings forecasted for any particular financial period  could impact the predictability of our quarterly results  and might limit our actual revenue in any given quarter  resulting in reduced and less predictable revenue and lower profitability 
our future growth will depend to some extent on our successful implementation of our intellectual property in solutions provided by third parties  including partners and suppliers 
our business and strategy rely  in part  on deployment of our digital watermark reader technology by third party software developers and original equipment manufacturers 
for example  one form of our digital watermark reader is commonly deployed in image editing applications offered by vendors including adobe  corel and ulead to permit users of these products to read watermarks embedded in imagery  and thereby discern the identities of image owners 
another form of our digital watermark reader is used in our anti counterfeiting product offerings 
we anticipate entering into additional agreements with third party vendors to create  promote and service products that incorporate  embed  integrate or bundle our technologies 
if if third parties who include such technologies in their products cease to do so  or we fail to obtain other partners that will incorporate  embed  integrate or bundle such technologies  or these partners are unsuccessful in their efforts  our efforts to expand deployment of our technologies would be adversely affected and  consequently  our ability to increase revenues would be adversely affected and we may suffer other adverse effects to our business 
in addition  if our technologies do not perform according to market expectations  our future sales would suffer as customers seek other providers 
some of our revenue models relating to anticipated products and services are under development 
if these revenue models and pricing structures do not gain market acceptance  the corresponding anticipated products and services may fail to attract or retain customers and we may not be able to generate new or sustain existing revenue 
some of our business involves embedding digital watermarks in traditional and digital media  including identification documents  secure documents  audio  video and imagery  and licensing our intellectual property 
through  our revenue stream was based primarily on a combination of development  consulting  subscription and license fees from copyright protection and counterfeit deterrence applications 
beginning in and for the foreseeable future  we have seen  and we anticipate  that the majority of our revenue will be from government and private sector customers for providing security related applications relating to secure personal identification  copyright protection  and counterfeit deterrence to such customers 
we have not fully developed revenue models for certain of our future digital watermarking applications and licensing endeavors 
because some of our products and services are not yet well established in the marketplace  and because some such products and services will not directly displace existing solutions  we cannot be certain that the pricing structure for these products and services will gain market acceptance or be sustainable over time or that the marketing for such products and services will be effective 
the security systems used in our product and service offerings may be circumvented or sabotaged by third parties  which could result in the disclosure of sensitive government information or private personal information or cause other business interruptions that could damage our reputation and disrupt our business 
our business relies on computers and other information technologies  both in house and at customer and vendor locations 
in addition  many of the systems we sell manage private personal information and protect information involved in sensitive government functions 
the protective measures that we use in these systems may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our business  damage our reputation  and expose us to litigation and liability 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures used in these systems could misappropriate sensitive or proprietary information or materials or cause interruptions or otherwise damage our products  services and reputation  and the property of our customers 
if unintended parties obtain sensitive data and information  or create bugs or viruses or otherwise sabotage the functionality of our systems  we may receive negative publicity  incur liability to our customers or lose the confidence of our customers  any of which may cause the termination or modification of our contracts 
further  our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses and liabilities that may result from such events 
in addition  we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect ourselves against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
such protection or remedial measures may not be available at a reasonable price or at all  or may not be entirely effective if commenced 
as international customers have accounted for approximately of our total revenue during the year ended december   the loss of these customers or the failure to find new customers may result in a decline in our international revenue  which could lower our profitability and slow our growth 
we expect revenue from sales of products and services to governments and other customers outside the us to represent a growing percentage of our total revenue in the future 
international sales and services are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and security requirements  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  trade barriers  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles than those for customers in the united states  difficulty in managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if we are affected by these risks  our sales of products and services to customers outside the us could be reduced significantly 
in addition  if foreign customers  in particular foreign government authorities  terminate or delay the implementation of our products and services  we may have limited recourse against them to recover any potential losses 
we generally do not invoice our foreign sales in us dollars  and  consequently  we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may in the future choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts  collared options  currency swap agreements or through similar hedging strategies 
however  no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
a significant portion of our business depends on contracts that are subject to a variety of terms and conditions  including damage payment obligations  as well as a variety of other provisions that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and our anticipated revenue to potentially decrease significantly 
our contracts for driver license and other identification issuance systems and related products typically include terms relating to  time based performance  development and delivery schedules customer acceptance and testing  and other performance milestones 
such provisions are common in large scale government contracts at the state and federal levels 
because procedures often require compliance over extended periods of time  they give rise to an increased risk that we may fail to meet timing or other delivery requirements and milestones pursuant to the terms of such contracts 
if we failed to meet such requirements or milestones  customers may assert against us compensatory or liquidated damages  breach of contract  or other claims 
consequently  our failure to meet contractual milestones or other performance requirements as promised could result in our having to incur increased costs  lower margins  or compensatory obligations  in addition to other losses  such as harm to our reputation 
such unexpected increases in costs to meet our contractual obligations or any other requirements necessary to address claims and damages with regard to our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we anticipate that future contracts will continue to have such provisions unless and until industry practices change 
a significant portion of our business depends on a limited number of large  public sector contracts  which are generally subject to termination for convenience  as determined by the subject agency  or for lack of budgetary appropriation provided for the subject agency 
some government contracts also may be one time events  such as in the case of some personal identification systems in non us markets involving voter registration programs 
in such cases  we may generate substantial revenue that may not be subject to future renewal 
moreover  government contracts result from purchasing decisions made by public sector agencies that may be subject to political influence  unusual procurement procedures  strict legal requirements  budget changes and cutbacks during economic downturns  variations in appropriations cycles  and protests of contract awards 
additionally  some governmental authorities require performance bonds that we are obligated to maintain during the life of the contract 
often  the terms of these bonds require that we maintain large restricted cash reserves as a guarantee  reducing our ability to use these funds for our other business purposes 
even with the availability of such cash reserve guarantees  we may not be able to obtain such performance bond underwriting at a favorable rate or at all 
our failure to be able to provide such performance bonds may preclude our ability to bid on new government contracts or maintain our existing contracts for their full terms 
the size  nature and purpose of  and the risks and uncertainties associated with  public sector contracts can potentially cause our quarterly results to fluctuate and anticipated revenue to decrease significantly 
a significant portion of our business depends on contracts with fixed price terms 
in the event of cost overruns in connection with such contracts  our margins may be adversely affected 
in addition to our normal price per card issuance contracts  we occasionally enter into agreements to sell entire systems or portions of a system for an agreed upon price 
these contracts normally do not have clauses that allow for recovery of cost overruns 
under these contracts  we provide specific tasks for a specific price and are typically paid on a milestone basis 
we have experienced low margins or losses on some of these contracts in the recent past 
such contracts involve greater financial risks because we bear the risk if actual project costs exceed the amounts we are paid under the contracts 
we may decline to pursue new  or renew existing  business opportunities in secure id systems markets due to objectionable terms required by the contracting agencies  or we may agree to objectionable contract terms for competitive reasons 
government agencies sometimes insist on unduly onerous terms in their contracts with vendors of secure id issuance systems 
for example  it is customary for state agencies to require that a vendor fund the capital intensive initial deployment of a driver license issuance system the costs of which the vendor normally recoups over the life of the contract in per card fees  while reserving the right to terminate the contract for convenience 
similarly  in connection with intellectual property rights  a contract may require that our pre existing issuance system software be written in a different language and a state may then argue that it falls within the class of works for which it owns the copyright  enabling the state to turn the digimarc authored software over to one of our competitors  dedicate it to the public domain  or otherwise use the software in a manner detrimental to our business 
objectionable contract terms may lead us to decline to bid on identification issuance systems to new customers  or to decline to retain business with customers we have historically served  which could reduce our market share and lower our revenues or profits 
in addition  if we decline to retain business with customers we have historically served  it could result in the accelerated depreciation of intangible assets 
alternatively  we may decide to accept at least some level of objectionable terms rather than cede an important contract to a competitor  which could also lower our revenues or profits 
a loss of a material supplier could have a material adverse effect on our ability to perform effectively under some of our contracts 
we are materially dependent on a limited number of third parties to produce systems or assemblies necessary for us to produce some of our products 
while we strive to have alternative suppliers provide us with many of our products  a loss of one or more of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to perform effectively  if at all  under some of our contracts 
we are subject to risks encountered by companies developing and relying upon new technologies  products and services for substantial amounts of their growth or revenue 
our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties to which companies with new and rapidly evolving technologies  products and services  such as digital watermarking  are exposed 
these risks include the following we may be unable to develop sources of new revenue or sustainable growth in revenue because our current and anticipated technologies  products and services may be inadequate or may be unable to attract or retain customers  the intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry could adversely affect the market s acceptance of our existing and new products and services  and we may be unable to develop and maintain new technologies upon which our existing and new products and services are dependent in order for our products and services to be sustainable and competitive and in order for us to expand our revenue and business 
some of our key technologies are in the development stage 
consequently  products incorporating these key technologies are undergoing technological change and are in the early stage of introduction in the marketplace 
delays in the adoption of these products or adverse competitive developments may result in delays in the development of new revenue sources or the growth in our revenue 
in addition  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital expenditures in the event product changes or improvements are required 
additionally  new industry standards might redefine the products that we are able to sell  especially if these products are only in the prototype stage of development 
if product changes or improvements are required  success in marketing these products and achieving profitability from these products could be delayed or halted 
we also may be required to fund such changes or improvements out of operating income  which could reduce or eliminate our profitability 
we may not be able to protect adequately our intellectual property  and we may be subject to infringement claims and other litigation  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends in part on licensing our proprietary technologies 
to protect our growing intellectual property investments  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements 
unlicensed copying and use of our intellectual property or illegal infringements of our intellectual property rights represent losses of revenue to the company 
we face risks associated with our patent position  including the potential and sometimes actual need from time to time to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents  the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied  and the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents 
budgetary concerns may cause us not to file  or continue  litigation against known infringers of our patent rights  or may cause us not to file for  or pursue  patent protection for all of our inventive technologies in jurisdictions where they may have value 
some governmental entities that might infringe our intellectual property rights may enjoy sovereign immunity from such claims 
failure to reliably enforce our patent rights against infringers may make licensing more difficult 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technologies adequately  if there are changes in applicable laws that are adverse to our interests  or if we become involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technologies or relating to the intellectual property rights of others  our business could be seriously harmed because the value ascribed to our intellectual property could diminish and result in a lower stock price or we may incur significant costs in bringing legal proceedings against third parties who are infringing our patents 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited  both in the united states and in other countries 
patent protection throughout the world is generally established on a country by country basis 
we have applied for patent protection both in the united states and in various other countries 
however  we cannot assure you that pending patents will be issued or that issued patents will be valid or enforceable 
failure to obtain such patents or failure to enforce those patents that are obtained may result in a loss of revenue to us 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technologies  duplicate our services or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we are the exclusive licensee under some third party patents  and may need the assistance of these parties if we choose to enforce any of these patent rights 
the cooperation of these third parties cannot be assured even though we rely on some of these technologies for our products 
as more companies engage in business activities relating to personal identification technologies and digital watermarking  and develop corresponding intellectual property rights  it is increasingly likely that claims may arise which assert that some of our products or services infringe upon other parties intellectual property rights 
these claims could subject us to costly litigation  divert management resources and result in the invalidation of our intellectual property rights 
these claims may require us to pay significant damages  cease production of infringing products  terminate our use of infringing technologies or develop non infringing technologies 
in these circumstances  continued use of our technologies may require that we acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the alleged infringement  and we might not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our use of protected technologies may result in liability that threatens our continuing operation 
some of our contracts include provisions by which we assure non infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
as deployment of our technology increases  and more companies enter our markets  the likelihood of a third party lawsuit resulting from such indemnification increases 
if an infringement arose in a context governed by such a contract  we may have to refund to our customer amounts already paid to us or pay significant damages  or we may be sued by the party allegedly infringed upon 
similarly  as we seek to broaden the number of companies licensed under our patent portfolio  some may seek contractual assurances that we will pursue by litigation if necessary their competitors who use our patented technology but are not licensed to do so 
compliance with any such contract provisions may require that we pursue litigation where our costs exceed our likely recovery 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  directors  consultants and corporate partners  and attempt to control access to and distribution of our technologies  solutions  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these procedures  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and make unauthorized use of our technologies  solutions or other proprietary information or independently develop similar technologies  solutions or information 
the steps that we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our solutions  technologies or other proprietary information may not prevent their misappropriation  particularly outside the united states where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
products that we are developing for new secure identification markets and components and subsystems markets may not be accepted as quickly as we have projected or at all  which may negatively impact our revenues  margins  earnings and stock price 
we have invested significant time and resources in product development activities for new secure identification markets  including designing and developing numerous enhancements to our driver license systems and improving our cards ability to withstand intrusions or alterations without detection 
at present  our new products include digimarc id validation suite idvs and digimarc idmarc 
if we do not experience a timely  positive reaction from issuing authorities to our new offerings  our projected revenues  margins and earnings may be negatively impacted 
in addition  we are developing new sales channels in domestic and foreign markets for certain components and subsystems of our domestic driver license solutions 
we believe these new sales channels may contribute significantly to our future results  as our products get placed into other programs and start generating recurring revenue streams 
however  given that this is an emerging area of our business  involving significant time and effort in connection with the development of new products and distribution relationships  there are ongoing risks that these market areas will not develop in the manner or along the timeline that we are projecting  or at all  resulting in significant costs and expenses without corresponding increases in any revenues and profits 
recent and ongoing leadership  staffing and organizational changes may result in disruptions and inefficiencies in our business during transition periods  may require process changes in our business  and will likely cause additional costs to our business before benefits from such changes may be realized 
during the second quarter of  we made significant changes in our management and staff as a result of a detailed review of our business processes 
many of these changes were initiated following the hiring of our new chief financial officer in june and other senior managers  and in conjunction with the continuing implementation of our new accounting and material requirements planning systems and work on sarbanes oxley compliance 
in  we made certain organizational changes designed to better consolidate the secure id systems and digital watermarking groups into a single business unit and thereby improve our business execution and operational efficiencies 
in addition  we appointed a new president of government programs and made considerable changes to the management team that reports to him 
while we anticipate that these changes in leadership and staffing will improve operations  there is a risk that these changes may disrupt the operations of our business and  consequently  may result in some short term inefficiencies as personnel complete their transitions and new leaders implement their new plans and procedures 
we also expect that these changes may require further modifications of our finance and business processes and will likely cause additional costs to our business in the short term before any benefits from such changes  if any  may be realized 
we depend on our senior management and key employees for our future success 
if we are not able to retain  hire or integrate these employees  we may not be able to meet our commitments 
our success depends to a significant extent on the performance and continued service of our senior management 
except for our chief executive officer  our senior management does not have employment agreements 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay projects or undermine customer relationships 
due to the high level of technical expertise that our industry requires  our ability to successfully develop  market  sell  license and support our products  services  and intellectual property depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key personnel in engineering  sales  marketing  operations  legal and licensing  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
similarly  without the continued contributions of our key finance personnel  we believe that our ability to meet our reporting obligations and operate successfully as a public company may be limited 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to retain our current key employees and our ability to attract  integrate and retain such personnel in the future 
it may not be practical for us to match the compensation certain of our employees could garner at other employment 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties in hiring and retaining employees because of concerns related to our shareholder litigation and financial performance 
in addition  these circumstances may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock  and employees and prospective employees may factor in the uncertainties relating to our stability and the value of any equity based incentives in their decisions regarding employment opportunities and decide to leave our employ 
in addition  our business is based in part on patented technology  which is unique and not generally known 
new employees require substantial training  involving significant resources and management attention 
competition for experienced personnel in our business can be intense 
if we do not succeed in attracting new  qualified personnel or in integrating  retaining and motivating our current personnel  our growth and ability to deliver products and services that our customers require may be hampered 
although our employees generally have executed agreements containing non competition clauses  there is no assurance that a court would enforce all of the terms of these clauses or the clauses generally 
if these clauses were not fully enforced  our employees could be able to freely join our competitors 
although we generally attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information by our employees  there can be no assurances that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial and business prospects 
we are engaged in several lawsuits alleging violations of securities law and cannot predict the outcome or ultimate cost of these actions with certainty 
we currently are engaged in litigation relating to the initial public offering of our securities  in addition to the class actions filed against us in connection with our previously announced accounting errors 
such litigation is expensive and lengthy 
these matters are discussed in greater detail in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k and in note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have incurred significant costs relating to these matters  and expect that we will continue to do so 
due to the inherent uncertainties of such litigation  the ultimate cost and outcome cannot be predicted 
if a judgment were to be entered against the company and our director and officer liability insurance was inadequate or unavailable  the obligation to pay the judgment may materially harm our business and financial condition 
our director and officer liability insurance policies provide protection against certain liabilities relating to the securities class action and derivative lawsuits against us and certain of our officers and directors up to prescribed policy limits 
if these policies do not adequately cover expenses and certain liabilities relating to these lawsuits  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
in addition  if this insurance coverage becomes unavailable to us or premiums increase significantly in the future  it could make it more difficult for us to retain and attract officers and directors and could expose us to potentially self funding certain future liabilities ordinarily mitigated by director and officer liability insurance 
we may be required to invest significant additional time and resources to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which may increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability in the near future 
in  we discovered certain material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures and since then have deployed significant resources to design and implement new and enhanced controls and procedures 
as we monitor the regulatory requirements in the future  we may discover additional problems that require further modifications to our controls  review processes and financial management  which could result in our company experiencing additional costs and expenses that may reduce our profitability in the near future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of any interest expense we must pay with respect to outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities that are tied to market rates 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
at december   we had an investment portfolio of money market funds  commercial securities and us government securities  including those classified as cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments  of million 
the original maturities of our investment portfolio range from to days with an average interest rate of 
we had capital lease obligations of approximately million at december  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair market value of the fixed income portfolio and loans outstanding would not be material 
to a lesser extent  the company is also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in the form of exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
