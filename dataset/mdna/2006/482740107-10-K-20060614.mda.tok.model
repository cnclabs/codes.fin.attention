these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed throughout this report and specifically under the captions cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
background we are a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  acquires  manufactures and markets technologically distinguished branded and generic non branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
we have a broad range of dosage form capabilities  including tablets  capsules  creams  liquids and ointments 
we conduct our branded pharmaceutical operations through ther rx corporation and our generic non branded pharmaceutical operations through ethex corporation  which focuses principally on technologically distinguished generic products 
through particle dynamics  inc  we develop  manufacture and market technologically advanced  value added raw material products for the pharmaceutical  nutritional  personal care  food and other markets 
we have a broad portfolio of drug delivery technologies which we leverage to create technologically distinguished brand name and specialty generic products 
we have developed and patented drug delivery and formulation technologies primarily in four principal areas site release r bioadhesives  oral controlled release  tastemasking and oral quick dissolving tablets 
we incorporate these technologies in the products we market to control and improve the absorption and utilization of active pharmaceutical compounds 
these technologies provide a number of benefits  including reduced frequency of administration  reduced side effects  improved drug efficacy  enhanced patient compliance and improved taste 
our drug delivery technologies allow us to differentiate our products in the marketplace  both in the branded and generic non branded pharmaceutical areas 
we believe that this differentiation provides substantial competitive advantages for our products  allowing us to establish a strong record of growth and profitability and a leadership position in certain segments of our industry 
results of operations during fiscal  we recorded expense of million in connection with the femmepharma acquisition see note to consolidated financial statements that consisted of million for acquired in process research and development and million for direct expenses related to the transaction 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value of the worldwide marketing rights to an endometriosis product we acquired as part of the femmepharma acquisition that  at the time of the acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been clinically proven 
the femmepharma acquisition expense of million reduced our fiscal diluted earnings per share by to per diluted share and reduced our fiscal net income to million 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal as we reported sales growth of and in our branded products and specialty generics segments  respectively 
the resulting million increase in gross profit was offset in part by a million increase in operating expenses before taking into account the million of expense associated with the femmepharma acquisition 
this increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  branded marketing and promotions expense  legal and professional expenses  and research and development expense 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total net revenues    the growth in branded product sales was due primarily to increased sales of our two anti infective brands  clindesse tm and gynazole r  and continued sales growth from our hematinic and prescription prenatal product lines 
clindesse tm  a single dose prescription cream therapy indicated to treat bacterial vaginosis  contributed million of sales during fiscal since its launch in january  clindesse tm has gained of the intravaginal bacterial vaginosis market 
sales of gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal cream product  increased million  or  to million during fiscal this increase was due primarily to higher pricing as our prescription volume declined in fiscal sales of our hematinic products in fiscal increased million  or  to million 
the growth in hematinic sales resulted from a increase in prescription volume during fiscal  higher pricing and million of incremental sales associated with the introduction of two new products  niferex r gold and repliva tm 
also included in branded product sales was our precare r product line which continued as the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states 
sales from our precare r product line increased million  or  to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to sales growth experienced by primacare r one  our proprietary line extension to primacare r  as its share of the branded prenatal nutritional supplement market increased to at the end of fiscal the increase in precare r product sales was also impacted by a temporary fourth quarter supply disruption of primacare r one in the prior year 
the increase in branded product sales was further supplemented by the introduction of encora tm  a new prescription nutritional supplement with essential fatty acids  which contributed million of incremental revenue during fiscal and a million increase in sales of our micro k r product line 
the increase in specialty generic sales resulted from million of increased sales volume from existing products in our cough cold  pain management and digestive enzyme product lines coupled with million of incremental sales volume from new product introductions primarily in our pain management product line 
these increases were offset in part by product price erosion of million that resulted from pricing pressures on certain products 
although specialty generic sales resulting from new product introductions were limited during fiscal  we did receive late in the fiscal year anda approval for five strengths of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets and three strengths of hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets 
also  late in fiscal  we received a favorable court ruling in a paragraph iv patent infringement action filed against us by astrazeneca based on our anda submissions to market generic formulations of toprol xl r 
we believe we were the first company to file with the fda for generic approval of the mg and mg dosage strengths  a position that may  upon approval  afford us the opportunity for a six month exclusivity period for marketing these generic versions 
the total branded dollar volume of toprol xl r in was billion  of which the mg and mg strengths represented nearly half 
the decrease in specialty material product sales was primarily due to reduced sales on a product that is used by a customer in a chewable vitamin that the customer was in the process of reformulating  coupled with increased competition on our calcium carbonate products 
gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other    total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant sales growth experienced by our branded products segment 
the higher gross profit percentage on a consolidated basis reflected the impact of our higher margin branded products comprising a larger percentage of net revenues 
this effect was offset in part by lower margins in the specialty generics segment due primarily to the impact of price erosion on certain products in the cardiovascular and pain management product lines coupled with a shift in the mix of sales toward lower margin products  particularly in the cough cold category 
the gross profit percentage decrease experienced by specialty materials primarily resulted from higher production costs associated with lower volume and an unfavorable mix of products sold 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense was due to increased spending on bioequivalency studies as we continued active development of various branded and generic non brand products in our internal and external pipelines and increased personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
we anticipate that research and development costs for fiscal will continue to increase based on our growing product development pipeline  the expected cost of the phase iii clinical study on the endometriosis product acquired in the first quarter of fiscal and other branded and generic opportunities 
purchased in process research and development years ended march  change in thousands purchased in process research and development   nm during fiscal  we recorded expense of million in connection with the femmepharma acquisition that consisted of million for acquired in process research and development and million in direct expenses related to the transaction 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of the worldwide marketing rights to an endometriosis product we acquired as part of the femmepharma acquisition that  at the time of the acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the femmepharma acquisition expense of million reduced our diluted earnings per share for the year ended march  by 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to o million increase in personnel costs associated with expansion of the branded sales force in fiscal and and increases in management and other personnel to support the overall growth of the business  o million increase in branded marketing and promotions expense for promotion of our existing brands  to further promote the launch of clindesse tm and to support the introduction in fiscal of a new prescription nutritional supplement product and two new hematinic products  and o million increase in legal and professional expense commensurate with an increase in litigation activity and evaluation of potential acquisition opportunities 
the increase in litigation activity included ongoing costs associated with certain patent infringement actions brought against us on products we market or propose to market 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   as of net revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to a full year s amortization in fiscal of license costs incurred for a product launched in fiscal under a co development arrangement  an increase in amortization of patent and trademark costs  and amortization of the purchase price allocated to the non compete agreement obtained in the femmepharma acquisition 
litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation   nm the million of income reflected in litigation for fiscal consisted of a million net payment received by us in accordance with a favorable legal settlement of vitamin antitrust litigation and million associated with the reversal of excess reserves that resulted from settlement of the healthpoint litigation in fiscal operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the decrease in operating income resulted from the million in process research and development charge recorded in connection with the femmepharma acquisition 
interest expense years ended march  change in thousands interest expense   the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the completion of a number of capital projects during fiscal and the related reduced level of capitalized interest thereon 
interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income    the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase in interest income on short term investments and dividends earned on redeemable preferred stock 
the increase in interest income resulted from a full year s effect of investing excess cash into short term investments with higher yielding interest rates 
the higher weighted average interest rate earned on short term investments was offset in part by a decline in the average balance of invested cash 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to the non deductibility for tax purposes of the million of expense we recorded for the femmepharma acquisition 
for fiscal  the provision for income taxes was based on an effective tax rate of which was applied to a pre tax income amount that excluded the femmepharma acquisition expense of million 
net income and diluted earnings per share years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the decrease in net income resulted from the million in process research and development charge  or per share  we recorded in connection with the femmepharma acquisition 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due primarily to the introduction of clindesse tm in the fourth quarter of fiscal  continued growth of gynazole r and increased sales of our two hematinic brands 
the introduction of clindesse tm  a single dose prescription cream therapy indicated to treat bacterial vaginosis  contributed million of incremental sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal cream product  increased million  or  to million during fiscal as our share of the prescription vaginal antifungal cream market increased 
sales from our two hematinic product lines  chromagen r and niferex r  increased to million during fiscal as both product lines experienced significant growth in new prescriptions filled 
during the year  new prescription growth for chromagen r and niferex r was and  respectively  compared to the prior year 
also included in branded product sales was the precare r product line which contributed million of sales during fiscal although sales of our precare r product line declined during the year  the precare r family of products continued to be the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states 
the million decrease in sales of our precare r product line was partially the result of a temporary fourth quarter supply disruption of primacare r one  our proprietary line extension to primacare r  that was launched in the second quarter 
prior to the occurrence of this supply issue  which has since been resolved  primacare r one generated million of incremental sales in fiscal the increase in branded product sales for fiscal was partially offset by a million decline in sales of our micro k r product line 
the growth in specialty generic sales resulted from million of incremental sales volume from new product introductions  principally in our lower margin cough cold product line  coupled with million of increased sales volume from existing products in our cardiovascular and pain management product lines 
these increases were offset in part by product price erosion of million principally in the second half of the fiscal year  that resulted from pricing pressures on certain products in the cardiovascular  pain management and cough cold product lines 
although specialty generic sales increased in fiscal  we experienced an million  or  decline in sales for the three months ended march  this decrease resulted from a significant decline in cardiovascular products sales due in part to the absence of trade shows that occurred in the fourth quarter of the prior year and resulted in an unfavorable mix in product categories in the fourth quarter of fiscal the anticipated approval of diltiazem and another product in the fourth quarter of fiscal  would have more than offset the above decrease  had the approval been received 
the increase in specialty material product sales was primarily due to renewed focus on expanding the specialty materials business  the addition of a new major customer in fiscal that resulted in million of incremental sales and an increased emphasis on international markets that provided additional sales of million in fiscal gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other    total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the sales growth experienced by all three of our segments branded products  specialty generics and specialty materials 
the lower gross profit percentage on a consolidated basis primarily reflected the impact of price erosion on certain specialty generic products beginning in the second quarter and extending through the balance of fiscal  offset in part by certain selective price increases implemented near the end of the third quarter 
the gross profit percentage decline experienced by the specialty generics segment was offset in part by a shift in the mix of branded product sales toward higher margin products with the introduction of clindesse tm in the fourth quarter coupled with improved pricing and lower raw material costs at our specialty materials business 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense primarily resulted from increased spending on bioequivalency studies for products in our internal development pipeline and higher personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was due primarily to greater personnel expenses resulting from an increase in management and other personnel million and expansion of the branded sales force million including approximately million for sales representatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million increase in branded marketing and promotions expense commensurate with the growth of the segment due to the investment of hiring additional management and field personnel to provide additional resources for future planned product launches  a million increase in rent  depreciation  insurance and utilities expense associated with expansion of our office facilities over the past two years  a million increase in professional fees associated primarily with implementation of the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  a million increase in legal expense  and million of costs incurred in the fourth quarter to support the launch of clindesse tm 
the increase in legal expense was due to an increase in litigation activity  which included various patent infringement actions brought by potential competitors with respect to products we propose to market and for which we have submitted anda filings and provided notice of certification required under the provisions of the hatch waxman act 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   as of net revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the amortization of license costs incurred for a product launched under a co development arrangement in fiscal litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation   the million of income reflected in litigation in fiscal consisted of a million net payment received by us in accordance with a favorable legal settlement of vitamin antitrust litigation and million related to the reversal of excess reserves related to the healthpoint litigation 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received million for settlement with a branded company of our claim that the branded company interfered with our right to a timely introduction of a generic product in a previous fiscal year 
the impact of this payment was offset in part by an additional litigation reserve of million related to attorneys fees awarded in the healthpoint matter  which subsequently was settled 
operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the decrease in operating income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in selling and administrative expense coupled with a million increase in research and development expense  offset in part by a million increase in gross profit 
interest expense years ended march  change in thousands interest expense   the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the level of capitalized interest recorded on capital projects that we had in process 
interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income   the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate earned on short term investments  offset in part by a decline in the average balance of short term investments 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the decrease in the provision for income taxes resulted from a corresponding decrease in income before taxes coupled with a decline in the effective tax rate 
the decline in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from the implementation of various tax planning initiatives  as well as the generation of income tax credits at both the federal and state levels 
net income and diluted earnings per share years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the decrease in net income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in selling and administrative expense coupled with a million increase in research and development expense  offset in part by a million increase in gross profit 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and working capital were million and million  respectively  at march   compared to million and million  respectively  at march  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from a million increase in inventories related primarily to new specialty generic products we expect to launch in fiscal  offset in part by a million decrease in receivables associated primarily with a million increase in the reserve for chargebacks and a million increase in the reserve for medicaid rebates 
the increase in the reserve for chargebacks at march  was primarily due to our specialty generics segment experiencing continued price erosion during fiscal coupled with higher customer inventory levels of our specialty generic products at the end of the year 
the impact of increased utilization of our branded products by state medicaid programs during the past two years resulted in a larger reserve for medicaid rebates at march  the primary source of operating cash flow used in the funding of our businesses continues to be internally generated funds from product sales 
net cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the operating cash flows for fiscal including an million reduction in accrued liabilities attributable to settlement of the healthpoint litigation which was resolved during fiscal net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year

the million of net proceeds we received from the new mortgage loan will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the new mortgage loan bears interest at a rate of and matures on april  in may  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that are convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of and mature on may  we are also obligated to pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period commencing may   if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more

the convertible subordinated notes are subordinate to all of our existing and future senior obligations 
at march   we had credit agreements with two banks that provided revolving lines of credit for borrowing up to million 
the credit agreements provided for million in revolving lines of credit along with supplemental credit lines of million that were available for financing acquisitions 
these credit facilities were to expire in october and june  respectively 
the revolving and supplemental credit lines were unsecured and interest was charged at the lower of the prime rate or the one month libor rate plus basis points 
at march   we had million in an open letter of credit issued under the revolving credit line and no cash borrowings under either credit facility 
the credit agreements contained financial covenants that imposed minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a maximum funded debt ratio  a limit on capital expenditures and dividend payments  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
as of march   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
on june   we replaced our million credit line by entering into a new credit agreement with ten banks that provides for a revolving line of credit for borrowing up to million 
the new credit agreement also includes a provision for increasing the revolving commitment  at the lenders sole discretion  by up to an additional million 
the new credit facility is unsecured unless we  under certain specified circumstances  utilize the facility to redeem part or all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
interest is charged under the facility at the lower of the prime rate or one month libor plus to basis points depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the new credit agreement contains financial covenants that impose limits on dividend payments  require minimum equity  a maximum senior leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio

up to million of industrial revenue bonds may be issued to us by st 
louis county relative to capital improvements made through december  this agreement provides that of the real and personal property taxes on up to million of capital improvements will be abated for a period of years subsequent to the property being placed in service 
industrial revenue bonds totaling million were outstanding at march  the industrial revenue bonds are issued by st 
louis county to us upon our payment of qualifying costs of capital improvements  which are then leased by us for a period ending december   unless earlier terminated 
we have the option at any time to discontinue the arrangement and regain full title to the abated property 
the industrial revenue bonds bear interest at per annum and are payable as to principal and interest concurrently with payments due under the terms of the lease 
we have classified the leased assets as property and equipment and have established a capital lease obligation equal to the outstanding principal balance of the industrial revenue bonds 
lease payments may be made by tendering an equivalent portion of the industrial revenue bonds 
as the capital lease payments to st 
louis county may be satisfied by tendering industrial revenue bonds which is our intention  the capital lease obligation  industrial revenue bonds and related interest expense and interest income  respectively  have been offset for presentation purposes in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands less than more than total year years years years obligations at march  long term debt obligations a      operating lease obligations b   other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations c      a holders of the million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes may require the company to repurchase them for an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount in may b the purchase option on a  square foot building leased by us on march  was exercised by us in accordance with the lease agreement and is scheduled to be acquired for million in june c the company has licensed the exclusive rights to co develop and market various generic equivalent products with other drug delivery companies 
these collaboration agreements require the company to make up front and ongoing payments as development milestones are attained 
if all milestones remaining under these agreements were reached  payments by the company could total up to  we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations and funds available under our credit facilities  will be adequate to fund operating activities for the presently foreseeable future  including the payment of short term and long term debt obligations  capital improvements  research and development expenditures  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business 
in addition  we continue to examine opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of or investment in companies  technologies  product rights  research and development and other investments that are compatible with our existing businesses 
we intend to use our available cash to help in funding any acquisitions or investments 
as such  cash has been invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
we also may use funds available under our credit facilities  or financing sources that subsequently become available  including the future issuances of additional debt or equity securities  to fund these acquisitions or investments 
if we were to fund one or more such acquisitions or investments  our capital resources  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted in future periods 
inflation inflation may apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us in the future 
however  we believe that the net effect of inflation on our operations during the past three years has been minimal 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information that is obtained from customers and outside sources  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
our critical accounting estimates are described below 
revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues 
revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  the customer s payment ability has been reasonably assured and title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon shipment to the customer 
simultaneously with the recognition of revenue  we reduce the amount of gross revenues by recording estimated sales provisions for chargebacks  sales rebates  sales returns  cash discounts and other allowances  and medicaid rebates 
these sales provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including but not limited to  historical relationship to revenues  historical payment and return experience  estimated and actual customer inventory levels  customer rebate arrangements  and current contract sales terms with wholesale and indirect customers 
from time to time  we provide incentives to our wholesale customers  such as trade show allowances or stocking allowances that they in turn use to accelerate distribution to their end customers 
we believe that such incentives are normal and customary in the industry 
sales allowances are accrued and revenue is recognized as sales are made pursuant to the terms of the allowances offered to the customer 
due to the nature of these allowances  we are able to accurately calculate the required provisions for the allowances based on the specific terms in each agreement 
additionally  customers will normally purchase additional product ahead of regular demand to take advantage of the temporarily lower cost resulting from the sales allowances 
this practice has been customary in the industry and we believe would be part of a customer s ordinary course of business inventory level 
we reserve the right  with our major wholesale customers  to limit the amount of these forward buys 
sales made as a result of allowances offered on our specialty generics product line in conjunction with trade shows sponsored by our major wholesale customers and for other promotional programs accounted for and of total gross revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  we understand that certain of our wholesale customers have anticipated the timing of price increases and have made  and may continue to make  business decisions to buy additional product in anticipation of future price increases 
this practice has been customary in the industry and we believe would be part of a customer s ordinary course of business inventory level 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesale customers  which accounted for approximately of our unit sales in fiscal  through an internal analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler contract sales  available end consumer prescription information and inventory data received from our three largest wholesale customers 
we believe that our evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels allows us to make reasonable estimates of our reserve balances 
further  our products are typically sold with adequate shelf life to permit sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell our products in their inventory through to the end consumer 
the following table reflects the fiscal activity for each reserve that serves to reduce our receivables balance current provision current provision actual returns related to sales related to sales or credits in thousands beginning made in the made in in the ending balance current period prior periods current period balance year ended march  accounts receivable reserves chargebacks     sales rebates     sales returns     cash discounts and other allowances     medicaid rebates     total     the increase in the reserve for chargebacks at march  was primarily due to our specialty generics segment experiencing price erosion during fiscal coupled with higher customer inventory levels of our specialty generic products at the end of the year 
the reserve for sales returns at march  was relatively consistent with the prior year end balance as improvement in the rate of product returns at our specialty generics segment was offset by an increase in the product return rate at our branded business 
the impact of increased utilization of our branded products by state medicaid programs during the past two years resulted in a larger reserve for medicaid rebates at march  the increase in reserves for sales rebates and cash discounts and other allowances at march  was primarily due to greater fourth quarter sales in fiscal compared to the prior year s fourth quarter

increased utilization of products in our branded products segment by state medicaid programs during fiscal resulted in the increase in the reserve for medicaid rebates  which was reflected in an increase in the related provision from of sales in fiscal to of sales in fiscal reserves for sales rebates and cash discounts and other allowances declined primarily due to lower fourth quarter sales  in both the retail chain and wholesale distribution channels  compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
the reserves for sales rebates and cash discounts and other allowances require a lower degree of subjectivity  are less complex in nature and are more readily ascertainable due to specific contract terms  rates and consistent historical performance 
the reserves for chargebacks  sales returns and medicaid rebates  however  are more complex and require management to make more subjective judgments 
these reserves and their respective provisions are discussed in further detail below 
chargebacks we market and sell products directly to wholesalers  distributors  warehousing pharmacy chains  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasing groups 
we also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies  non warehousing chains  managed care organizations  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products 
these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  we may pre authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers 
under either arrangement  we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
chargeback transactions are almost exclusively related to our specialty generics business segment 
during fiscal and  the chargeback provision reduced the gross sales of our specialty generics segment by million and million  respectively 
these amounts accounted for and of the total chargeback provisions recorded in fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the primary factors we consider in developing and evaluating the reserve for chargebacks include x the amount of inventory in the wholesale distribution channel 
we receive actual inventory information from our three major wholesale customers and estimate the inventory position of the remaining wholesalers based on historical buying patterns 
during fiscal  unit sales to our three major wholesale customers accounted for of our total unit sales to all wholesalers  and the aggregate inventory position of the three major wholesalers at march  was approximately equivalent to our last eight weeks of shipments during the fiscal year 
we currently use the last six weeks of our shipments as an estimate of the inventory held by the remaining wholesalers where we do not receive actual inventory data  as our experience and buying patterns indicate that our smaller wholesale customers carry less inventory than our large wholesale customers 
as of march   each week of inventory for those remaining wholesalers represented approximately million  or  of the reported reserve for chargebacks 
x the percentage of sales to our wholesale customers that will result in chargebacks 
using our automated chargeback system we track  at the product level  the percentage of sales units shipped to our wholesale customers that eventually result in chargebacks to us 
the percentage for each product  which is based on actual historical experience  is applied to the respective inventory units in the wholesale distribution channel 
as of march   the aggregate weighted average percentage of sales to wholesalers assumed to result in chargebacks was approximately  with each representing approximately million  or  of the reported reserve for chargebacks 
x contract pricing and the resulting chargeback per unit 
the chargeback provision is based on the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler referred to as wholesale acquisition cost  or wac and the contract price negotiated with either our indirect customer or with the wholesaler for sales by the wholesaler to the indirect customers 
we calculate the price difference  or chargeback per unit  for each product and for each major wholesale customer using historical weighted average pricing  based on actual chargeback experience 
use of weighted average pricing over time compensates for changes in the mix of indirect customers and products from period to period 
as of march   a shift in the calculated chargeback per unit in the same direction across all products and customers would result in a million  or  impact on the reported reserve for chargebacks 
shelf stock adjustments these adjustments represent credits issued to our wholesale customers that result from a decrease in our wac 
decreases in our invoice prices are discretionary decisions we make to reflect market conditions 
these credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce a wholesale customer s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices 
generally  we provide credits to customers at the time the price reduction occurs based on the inventory that is owned by them on the effective date of the price reduction 
since a reduction in wac reduces the chargeback per unit  or the difference between wac and the contract price  shelf stock adjustments are typically included as part of the reserve for chargebacks because the price reduction credits act essentially as accelerated chargebacks 
although we have contractually agreed to provide price adjustment credits to our major wholesale customers at the time they occur  the impact of any such price reductions not included in the reserve for chargebacks is immaterial to the amount of revenue recognized in any given period 
sales returns consistent with industry practice  we maintain a returns policy that allows our direct and indirect customers to return product six months prior to expiration and within one year after expiration 
this policy is applicable to both our branded and specialty generics business segments 
upon recognition of revenue from product sales to customers  we provide for an estimate of product to be returned 
this estimate is determined by applying a historical relationship of customer returns to gross sales 
we evaluate the reserve for sales returns by calculating historical return rates using data from the last months on a product specific basis and by class of trade wholesale versus retail chain 
the calculated percentages are applied against estimates of inventory in the distribution channel on a product specific basis 
to determine the inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel  we utilize actual inventory information from our major wholesale customers and estimate the inventory positions of the remaining wholesalers based on historical buying patterns 
for inventory held by our non wholesale customers  we use the last two months of sales to the direct buying chains and the indirect buying retailers as an estimate 
a change in the product specific historical return rates used in the reserve analysis would have changed the reserve balance at march  by approximately million  or  of the reported reserve for sales returns 
a change in the amount of estimated inventory in the distribution channel would have changed the reserve balance at march  by approximately million  or  of the reported reserve for sales returns 
medicaid rebates established in  the medicaid drug rebate program requires a drug manufacturer to provide to each state a rebate every calendar quarter for covered outpatient drugs dispensed to medicaid patients 
medicaid rebates apply to both our branded and specialty generic segments 
individual states invoice us for medicaid rebates on a quarterly basis using statutorily determined rates for generic and branded products  which are applied to the average manufacturer s price  or amp  for a particular product to arrive at a unit rebate amount  or ura 
the amount owed is based on the number of units dispensed by the pharmacy to medicaid patients extended by the ura 
the reserve for medicaid rebates is based on expected payments  which are driven by patient usage and estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
we estimate patient usage by calculating a payment rate as a percentage of net sales lagged six months  which is then applied to an estimate of customer inventory 
we currently use the last two months of our shipments to wholesalers and direct buying chains as an estimate of inventory in the wholesale and chain channels and an additional month of wholesale sales as an estimate of inventory held by the indirect buying retailer 
a change in the amount of customer inventory subject to medicaid rebates would have changed the reserve at march  by million  or of the reported reserve for medicaid rebates 
similarly  a change in estimated patient usage would have changed the reserve by million  or of the reported reserve for medicaid rebates 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution  raw materials and work in process 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out basis 
in evaluating whether inventory should be stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell existing inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves  when necessary  for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience and management s assessment of current product demand 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets principally consist of product rights  license agreements and trademarks resulting from product acquisitions and legal fees and similar costs relating to the development of patents and trademarks 
intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
upon approval  costs associated with the development of patents and trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
we determine amortization periods for intangible assets that are acquired based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangible asset s useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an intangible asset against an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
contingencies 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts 
an estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in legal proceedings could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
after review  it was determined at march  that for each of the various legal proceedings in which we are involved  the conditions mentioned above were not met 
we will continue to evaluate all legal matters as additional information becomes available 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter which requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently determining the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced an amendment to regulation s x to amend the date for compliance with sfas r 
the amendment requires each registrant that is not a small business issuer to adopt sfas r in the first fiscal year commencing after june  as a result  the company adopted sfas r beginning april  using the modified prospective method 
adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  as it will be required to expense the fair value of employee stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact on its consolidated net income within the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
based on the unvested stock option grants at march   the company estimates that the adoption of sfas r will reduce consolidated net income for fiscal between and per diluted share 
this estimate is based  in part  on a projection of our common stock prices and other valuation assumptions related to potential fiscal stock option grants which are subject to various uncertainties  including our future share based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeiture rate and employee stock option exercise behavior 
changes in any of the company s assumptions could cause future expenses to vary significantly from the company s current estimates 
in march  the sec issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which describes the sec staff s position on the application of sfas r 
sab contains interpretive and certain transitional guidance relating to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations including the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements including assumptions related to expected volatility and expected term  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  the modification of certain terms of employee share options prior to the adoption of sfas r and disclosures within management s discussion and analysis subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
we are currently evaluating sab and its guidance and will be adopting it as part of our adoption of sfas r beginning april  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas also requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements involving changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific or cumulative effect of the change 
this statement also requires that a change in the method of depreciation  amortization or depletion of long lived assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is accounted for prospectively 
sfas also retains many provisions of apb including those related to reporting a change in accounting estimate  a change in the reporting entity and a correction of an error and also carries forward provisions of sfas governing the reporting of accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes 
advances to us under our credit facilities bear interest at a rate that varies consistent with increases or decreases in the publicly announced prime rate and or the libor rate with respect to libor related loans  if any 
a material increase in such rates could significantly increase borrowing expenses 
we did not have any cash borrowings under our credit facilities at march  in may  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes is fixed at per annum and not subject to market interest rate changes 
beginning may   we will become obligated to pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period  if the average trading price of the convertible subordinated notes per  principal amount for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
in march  we entered into a million mortgage loan secured by three of our buildings that matures in april the interest rate on this loan is fixed at per annum and not subject to market interest rate changes
