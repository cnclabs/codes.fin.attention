references to we  our  and us refer to sonicwall  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview sonicwall provides security  productivity and mobility solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our access security products are typically deployed at the edges of small to medium sized local area networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies that do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our products are sold in over countries worldwide 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of the four items product  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 

table of contents we currently outsource our hardware manufacturing and assembly to contract manufacturers 
flash electronics manufactures and assembles many of our products at facilities in both the us and china 
our agreement with flash electronics  effective on june   provides for an initial term of one year and automatic renewal terms of one year each unless cancelled by either party upon days prior written notice by either party 
sercomm corporation of taiwan manufactures and assembles certain of our products at facilities located in taiwan 
our agreement with sercomm  effective on january   specifies an initial term of one year with automatic yearly renewal terms unless terminated by either party upon days prior written notice 
outsourcing our manufacturing and assembly enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we design and develop the key components for the majority of our products 
in addition  we generally determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturer using tests that we typically specify 
we sell our products through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end users 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
we seek to provide our channel and customers with differentiated solutions that are innovative  easy to use  reliable  and provide good value 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to developing new products and marketing our products to our channels and end user customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on our execution in these areas 
channel our distributors and resellers provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation and service of our security  productivity and mobility applications 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
with this business model  we reduce the potential for conflict with our channel 
we are also focused on helping our channel partners succeed with our products by concentrating on cost efficiencies in the distribution channel  comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel 
each appliance sale can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent sale of add on software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added services  such as content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention services 
we plan to introduce more service options for our platforms  which will allow us to generate additional revenue from both our installed base of platforms as well as from those services coupled to incremental product sales 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture  which we believe allows our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
specifically  we can provide protection at the gateway and enforced protection at the client level  and we can monitor and report on network activity 
thus  we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of this architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic 
table of contents key  which may be distributed through the internet 
this ability provides benefits to both us and our end users  because there is no need to modify  physically adjust or replace devices  which might create a significant burden on the company  channel partner or end user where there are a large number of products installed or where the platforms are distributed over a broad area 
end user acceptance we began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time we have shipped approximately  revenue units 
when measured by units shipped  we are typically among the top three suppliers in the markets in which we compete 
our experience in serving a broad market and installed base of customers provides us with opportunities to become a leader in the areas of ease of use and reduced total cost of ownership 
additionally  our demonstrated end user acceptance provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our products to their customers 
integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
each of our products ships with multiple ethernet network connections 
various models also integrate a b g wireless access points  v 
analog modems  and isdn terminal adapters to support different connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid set up and easy installation 
each of these tasks can be managed through a simple web browser session 
our opportunities  challenges and risks international growth our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing the international penetration rate to match the current domestic penetration rate 
if we fail to achieve our goal of greater international sales  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who are able to amortize their product investments over a larger available market 
license and services revenue we believe that the software and services component of our revenue has several characteristics that are positive for our business as a whole the license and services revenue is associated with a higher gross profit than our product revenue  the services component of the revenue is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provides in aggregate a more predictable revenue stream than product revenue  which is generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
if we are successful in licensing our software and selling our services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new product sales  we will likely be able to generate incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling associated services to our installed base or as part of new product sales  or realize lower service renewal rates  we risk having our revenue concentrated in more unpredictable product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic factors that affect much of the it market 
growing it budgets and an increase of funding for projects to provide security  mobility and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our products 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenue by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 

table of contents vertical markets we have achieved significant sales in certain vertical markets 
we believe that we can increase our sales in these markets through dedicated marketing and sales efforts focused on the unique requirements of these vertical markets 
to the extent that we are able to do so  we expect to see revenue growth and increased sales and marketing efficiency 
should our efforts in these areas fall short of our goals  because of the unsuitability of our products  increased competition  or for other reasons  we would expect to see a poor return on our marketing and sales investments in these areas 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt allowances  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  restructuring reserves  intangible assets  and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of the four items product  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
the company may experience material differences in the amount and timing of its revenue for any period if the management makes different judgments or utilize different estimates 
the company recognizes product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a  sab no 
b  sab and eitf the company applies provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  the company does not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
the company applies the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  to determine whether the provisions of sop apply to transactions involving the sale of products that include a software component 
the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while the company s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
retroactive price protection rights tied to certain specific circumstances are contractually offered to the company s channel partners 
the company evaluates these rights carefully based on stock on hand in the channels that has been purchased within days of the price change with the exception of ingram micro and tech data 
revenue from these two distributors is not recognized until they sell the product to their 
table of contents customers 
as a consequence  any requirement to provide price protection credits to these two distributors does not adversely impact previously recognized revenue 
in general  retroactive price adjustments are infrequent in nature 
at december    and  the company had a reserve for price protection in the amounts of    respectively 
delivery to domestic channel partners and international channel partners is generally deemed to occur when we deliver the product to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to to of the distributor s prior to months purchases or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
our two largest distributors  ingram micro and tech data  have rights of return under certain circumstances that are not limited  therefore  we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro and tech data until they sell the product to their customers  at which time their right of return expires 
evidence of an arrangement is manifested by a master distribution or oem agreement  an individual binding purchase order  or a signed license agreement 
in most cases  sales through our distributors and oem partners are governed by a master agreement against which individual binding purchase orders are placed on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon of the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with  and credit worthiness of  the distributor or reseller 
the company does not request collateral from our distributors or resellers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  the sale of an appliance which includes a year of free maintenance or a subscription based product  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this allocation process means that the company defers revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
the company s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  recognition of revenue occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes revenue for subscriptions and services  such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
the company s training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns and price changes related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments 
table of contents and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  deterioration in customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of inventory we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make since they are based  in part  on estimates of current and future economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence  current inventory levels  and purchase commitments 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december  based upon our determination that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses 
the net operating losses and research and development tax carryovers that make the vast majority of the deferred tax asset will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer installed base relationships  customer backlog and other intangibles 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from months to six years 
amortization of intangible assets was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company periodically evaluates its intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  the company makes an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  the company reduces the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by the company 
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment charge is recognized if a reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with sfas using one or more of the following fair value measures including present value techniques of estimated future cash flows  or valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue  or a similar performance measure 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial statements 
based on the impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in   or the goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes 
the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  the company records an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
significant transactions acquisitions on november   the company purchased lasso logic  inc lasso for approximately million in purchase consideration  consisting of cash  assumed stock options in the amount of  and  in direct transactions costs incurred in connection with the acquisition 
lasso provides continuous data protection for backup and recovery solutions for the small and medium business market 
the company believes that lasso s data backup solutions will provide a strong entry point to the growing data protection segment 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
the former shareholders of lasso made certain representations and warranties to the company and agreed to indemnify the company against damages which might arise from a breach of those undertakings 
as security for the indemnification obligation s sonicwall retained approximately million of the cash consideration  which is scheduled to be released to the former lasso shareholders on the month anniversary of the acquisition date 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  the company has agreed to pay million over the next to months to certain former shareholders of lasso contingent upon continued employment with the company 
amounts paid under these arrangements are recorded as compensation expense when earned 
the company allocated the purchase price based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to the identified intangible assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas and 
table of contents sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the following is the allocation of the purchase consideration in thousands net tangible assets intangible assets total purchase consideration the acquired intangible assets of million consists of the following million that was assigned to purchased technology and will be amortized over its estimated useful life of five years  million that was assigned to customer relationships and customer backlog which will be amortized over a period of months to one year  and million that was assigned to goodwill 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  the purchase consideration consisted of cash and stock options assumed 
the total calculated purchase consideration includes deferred stock based compensation representing unearned stock based compensation  equal to the fair value of assumed options  less the intrinsic value of such unvested options 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized ratably as stock based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
the unamortized balance for deferred stock based compensation is reflected as a reduction to additional paid in capital in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
on november   the company acquired certain assets from enkoo for approximately million in consideration  consisting of cash and transaction costs 
the company acquired the enkoo assets for its secure remote access technology and plans to integrate the key features of enkoo s technology into its ssl vpn products 
the assets acquired from enkoo included certain intangible assets 
in addition  certain employees of enkoo became employees of the company 
of the total purchase price of million  million was allocated to purchased technology and will be amortized over its estimated useful life of five years  and less than  was allocated to customer relationship and will be amortized over three months 
the remaining million was allocated to goodwill 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
pro forma results of operations have not been presented because these were not significant acquisitions as defined under the sec s s x rule commercialization of the technologies acquired as a result of these transactions carries a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results on february   the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire privately held mailfrontier  inc the aggregate announced purchase price for this acquisition was approximately million in cash

product of total revenue license and service of total revenue total revenue product revenue the decrease in product revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the mix of sales in all regions shifting to lower price point products  and a decline in the average sales price per unit of tz and pro product families 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in the number of tz units sold and bundled product offerings  sonicpoint g wireless access points  and the csm the reduction in the tz family average sales price per unit was in large part due to the extension of the low end of our product line with the

during  we continued to introduce new products including the ssl vpn  a product that provides organizations of all sizes with a secure clientless remote network and application access solution  and the pro  a port  gigabit class security solution 
we also extended our suite of secure wireless solutions with the sonicpoint g wireless access point and also launched the csm  the latest version of our utm enabled content security management solution 
the increase in product revenue in compared to was across all geographies  and across both our tz series and pro series products 
the increase in as compared to was mainly due to an increase in the volume of units shipped 
during  product revenue growth was fueled by the introduction and market acceptance of our new generation products  including the continued expansion of our tz access security appliance which we believe provides a compelling blend of ease of use for basic networks and flexibility for more complex networks 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the tz as part of our tz series product offering which we believe provides a feature rich total security platform combining ease of use with the flexibility to meet the changing needs of small and medium sized networks 
in addition  we augmented our pro series product family with new product introductions in during the first quarter of we introduced the pro comprehensive network security  mobility and productivity solution 
during the second quarter of we introduced the pro  a gigabit class appliance that extended the upward range of our pro series product offering 
license and service revenue license and service revenue is derived primarily from licensing of software products  such as our global management system and node upgrades and sales of subscription services such as content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention 
in addition  we generate license and service revenue from the sale of extended service contracts and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services 
we have experienced significant growth in license and services revenue and expect the market opportunity for our license and subscription service offerings  in particular  to grow as customer awareness around the dynamic requirements of unified network threat prevention management becomes more pervasive 
in addition  there is an opportunity to sell new subscription service offerings as well as renewals of existing contracts to our installed base of customers 
during  revenue from our subscription service offerings  including content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention  increased to million from approximately million in during  revenue from our subscription service offerings  including content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus and intrusion prevention  increased to million from approximately million in during  revenue from extended service contracts increased to approximately million from approximately million in during  revenue from extended service contracts increased to approximately million from approximately million in the increase in subscription services and other service contracts was primarily due to the increase in our installed base  increased marketing efforts  higher sales of software applications  and higher sales of subscription services sold in conjunction with our products

additionally  warranty costs and inventory provisions or write downs are included in cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue decreased by on a per unit basis despite the increase in shipments of 
the decrease in cost on a per unit basis is primarily the result of lower production cost associated with the expansion of our product offerings to include lower cost products  certain favorable reserve adjustments and a slight decrease in product cost across all product offerings due to lower component cost

we expected product gross profits to erode to the extent that we experience downward pressure on product pricing or upward pressure on production costs 
a change in the mix of product sold could also change gross profits 
gross profit from product sales increased in compared the increase in product gross profit was primarily the result of increased sales of our new product offerings  such as the tz access security appliance and the pro series product family  which generate higher gross profits 
gross profit in was impacted by the write downs of inventory related to obsolete products  the proceeds from the subsequent sale of these obsolete products were less than  we expected gross profits to continue to be challenged by continued price competition

revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in the first quarter of sfas r will result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans espp 
the company currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for a majority of its stock based awards to its employees and accounted for subsequently modified stock based awards under the variable accounting method 
under the intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recorded related to stock option grants issued under stock option plans when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to or greater than the fair market value on the date of grant 
in addition  discounts provided under espp do not currently require the recording of a corresponding compensation expense 
under sfas r  the company is required to adopt a fair value based method to measure and record the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method under sfas to determine the compensation expense for employee stock awards during  and stock based compensation expense in is comprised of two elements   related to a stock option grant  which was modified in fiscal year and is subject to variable accounting treatment  resulting in expense or contra expense recognition each period  using the cumulative expense method and  related the amortization of deferred stock based compensation for options assumed in the november acquisition of lasso

interest income and other expense  net 
interest income and other expense net were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively and primarily consists of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the fluctuations in the short term interest rates directly influence the interest income we recognize 
for the year ended december   the increase was primarily due to higher effective interest rates earned in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates offset by the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 

table of contents benefit from provision for income taxes 
year ended december  in thousands benefit provision percentage of total revenue period over period variance in dollars period over period variance in percent in all periods  the provision or benefit for income taxes is based on an estimated effective rate for each of the respective calendar years 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  due primarily to the effect of amortization of stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences and the utilization of  of the deferred tax assets derived from previously acquired companies 
the cumulative effect of these factors resulted in a reduction in goodwill 
at december   we continue to have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our determination that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets may not be realized in the foreseeable future given historical operating losses 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryovers that comprise the vast majority of the deferred tax assets will expire at various dates through the year our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal years ended december  and due primarily to the effect of amortization of stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences 
in addition  in  we determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to historical operating losses and therefore set up a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the impact of the change in the valuation allowance contributed also to the difference to the statutory rates 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryovers that comprise the vast majority of the deferred tax assets will expire at various dates through the year going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have demonstrated profitability for a period of time and begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  likely resulting in a significant benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate when this reversal might occur  if at all 
in addition  we expect a significant increase in our effective tax rate well above the statutory federal and state tax rates primarily caused by following factors 
at december   we have completely utilized the regular net operating losses that were generated by sonicwall  the remaining net operating losses consist of stock option and acquired net operating losses in tax free transactions and we further expect that the stock based compensation expense will create permanent and or temporary differences

liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  market acceptance of our products  and pursuit of corporate opportunities 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be our then current cash balances  funds from operations and whatever long term credit facilities we can arrange 
we have no other agreements or arrangements with third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources beyond twelve months 
we believe that future liquidity and capital resources will not be materially affected in the event we are not able to prevail in litigation for which we have been named a defendant as described in note to the consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements the information contained in note to the consolidated financial statements under the heading recent accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and further the goal of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our short term investments maturing in more than one year are readily tradable in to days 
due to this and the short duration of the balance of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents the amounts of our short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  maturing in less than more than one year one year total in thousands  except percentage data short term investments weighted average interest rate 
table of contents foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
because our sales are denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
