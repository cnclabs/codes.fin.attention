xi backlog because the time between order and shipment is usually less than three weeks  the company believes that backlog as of a particular date is not indicative of annual sales 
xii operating hazards and uninsured risks the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of product contamination or spoilage  including the presence of foreign objects  substances  chemicals  aflatoxin and other agents  or residues introduced during the growing  storage  handling or transportation phases 
although the company maintains rigid quality control standards  inspects its products by visual examination  metal detectors or electronic monitors at various stages of its shelling and processing operations for all of its nut and other food products  permits the usda to inspect all lots of peanuts shipped to and from the company s peanut shelling facilities  and complies with the nutrition labeling and education act by labeling each product that it sells with labels that disclose the nutritional value and content of each of the company s products  no assurance can be given that some nut or other food products sold by the company may not contain or develop harmful substances 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance of million per occurrence and umbrella coverage of up to million 
the company has begun to move its raw material storage facility to the current site and expects to complete the move during the first quarter of fiscal the cooling system at the current site utilizes ammonia 
if a leak in the system were to occur  there is a possibility all of the company s inventory could be destroyed 
at this time  the company s insurance policy would not reimburse the company for such a loss 
the company is currently evaluating the risk of an ammonia leak and the cost of additional insurance 

table of contents item a risk factors the company faces a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with its operations 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below 
while each risk is described separately  some of these risks are interrelated and it is possible that certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below 
also  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company  or that are currently deemed immaterial  could also potentially impair the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sustained losses would have a material adverse affect on the company in fiscal  the company incurred operating losses of million 
if the company continues to experience net operating losses due to  among other things  losses on various nut types such as almonds  such losses would have a material adverse affect on the company and its financial condition 
for example  the terms of the note agreement  as amended  include certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  require the company to attain minimum quarterly adjusted ebitda levels million  million  million and million for the four quarters of fiscal 
if the company continues to experience net operating losses  among other things  the company will not be able to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the note agreement and the bank credit facility 
availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations the availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the company s products  including peanuts  pecans  almonds  walnuts and other nuts are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  such as weather conditions  plant diseases and changes in government programs 
additionally  the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials used in the company s products could be reduced upon any determination by the united states department of agriculture usda or other government agencies that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
the company purchases some of its nut supply directly from growers using fixed price contracts  some of which are entered into before harvest 
accordingly  there is a possibility that after the company enters into the fixed price contracts market conditions may change  and the company will be forced to sell the nuts at a loss 
in addition  the company is not able to hedge against changes in commodity prices because no market to do so exists  and thus  shortages in the supply of and increases in the prices of nuts and other raw materials used by the company in its products to the extent that cost increases cannot be passed on to customers could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
furthermore  fluctuations in the market prices of nuts may affect the value of the company s inventories and profitability 
the company has significant inventories of nuts that would be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction 
fixed price commitments the great majority of the company s industrial sales customers  and certain other customers  require the company to enter into fixed price commitments with its customers 
such commitments represented approximately of the company s annual net sales in fiscal  and in many cases are entered into after the company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price commitment is substantially fixed 
the commitments are for a fixed period of time  typically one year  but may be extended if remaining balances exist 
the company expects to continue to enter into fixed price commitments with respect to certain of its nut products after fixing its acquisition cost in order to maintain customer relationships or when  in management s judgment  market or crop harvest conditions so warrant 
to the extent the company does so  however  these fixed price commitments may result in reduced gross profit margins that have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
for example  the company s results of operations were adversely affected during fiscal due to losses on fixed price almond contracts 
the market prices for almonds declined significantly after the company entered into fixed price purchase contracts  but before fixed price sales 
table of contents contracts with customers were entered into 
in order to retain customers and remain competitive  the company was forced to sell the almonds at a loss 
in order to help decrease the company s exposure to the effects of a possible recurrence of a declining almond market in fiscal  the company is changing its method of purchasing almonds 
although the company is modifying its method for procuring almonds  there can be no assurance that this method will reduce the company s losses or the risks associated with buying almonds 
furthermore  the risks associated with vertical integration that contributed to the company s negative margins for almond sales also exist  to varying degrees  for other nut types that the company shells 
accordingly  since the company is a vertically integrated sheller  processor and seller of nuts and nut products  the effects of changing market prices can never be eliminated 
competitive environment the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s principal products compete against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies  some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company  such as planters and ralcorp holdings  inc the company s retail competitors buy their nuts on the open market and are thus not exposed to the risks of purchasing raw materials at fixed prices that later  due to altered market conditions  prove to be above market prices 
the company also competes with other shellers in the industrial market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets 
in order to maintain or increase its market share  the company must continue to price its products competitively  which may lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin  if the company is unable to increase unit volumes as well as reduce its costs 
dependence upon customers the company is dependent on a few significant customers for a large portion of its total sales  particularly in the consumer channel 
sales to the company s five largest customers represented approximately  and of gross sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
wal mart alone accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the loss of one of the company s largest customers  or a material decrease in purchases by one or more of its largest customers  would result in decreased sales and adversely impact the company s income and cash flow 
pricing pressures as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and the company s retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated  the company s retail customers are demanding lower pricing and increased promotional programs 
further  these customers may begin to place a greater emphasis on the lowest cost supplier in making purchasing decisions  particularly if buying techniques such as reverse internet auctions increase in popularity 
an increased focus on the lowest cost supplier could reduce the benefits of some of the company s competitive advantages 
the company s sales volume growth could suffer  and it may become necessary to lower the company s prices and increase promotional support of the company s products  any of which would adversely affect its gross profit and gross profit margin 
production limitations the company typically operates at or near its production capacity at certain times of the year 
if the company experiences an increase in customer demand  particularly prior to the completion of the company s facility consolidation project  it may be unable to fully satisfy its customers supply needs 
if the company becomes unable to supply sufficient quantities of products  it may lose sales and market share to its competitors 
food safety and product contamination the company could be adversely affected if consumers in the company s principal markets lose confidence in the safety of nut products  particularly with respect to peanut and tree nut allergies 
individuals with nut allergies may be at risk of serious illness or death resulting from the consumption of the company s nut products  including consumption of other companies products containing the company s products as an ingredient 
notwithstanding existing food safety controls  the company 
table of contents processes peanuts and tree nuts on the same equipment  and there is no guarantee that the company s products will not be cross contaminated 
concerns generated by risks of peanut and tree nut cross contamination and other food safety matters may discourage consumers from buying the company s products  cause production and delivery disruptions  or result in product recalls 
product liability and product recalls the company faces risks associated with product liability claims and product recalls in the event its food safety and quality control procedures fail and its products cause injury or become adulterated or misbranded 
in addition  the company does not control the labeling of other companies products containing the company s products as an ingredient 
a product recall of a sufficient quantity  or a significant product liability judgment against the company  could cause the company s products to be unavailable for a period of time and could result in a loss of consumer confidence in the company s food products 
these kinds of events  were they to occur  would have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and  consequently  the company s income and liquidity 
retention of key personnel the company s future success will be largely dependent on the personal efforts of its senior operating management team  including michael j 
valentine  the company s executive vice president finance  chief financial officer and secretary  jeffrey t 
sanfilippo  the company s executive vice president sales and marketing  and jasper b 
sanfilippo  jr  the company s executive vice president of operations  who have assumed management of the day to day operation of the company s business over the past two years 
in addition  the company s success depends on the talents of everardo soria  senior vice president pecan operations and procurement  walter r 
tankersley  jr  senior vice president industrial sales  charles m 
nicketta  senior vice president of manufacturing and michael g 
cannon  senior vice president of corporate operations 
the company believes that the expertise and knowledge of these individuals in the industry  and in their respective fields  is a critical factor to the company s continued growth and success 
the company has not entered into an employment agreement with any of these individuals  nor does the company have key officer insurance coverage policies in effect 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects if the company were unable to identify a suitable candidate to replace any such individual 
the company s success is also dependent upon its ability to attract and retain additional qualified marketing  technical and other personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
risks and uncertainties regarding facility consolidation project the facility consolidation project may not result in significant cost savings or increases in efficiency  or allow the company to increase its production capabilities to meet any future increases in customer demand 
moreover  the company s expectations with respect to the financial impact of the facility consolidation project are based on numerous estimates and assumptions  any or all of which may differ from actual results 
such differences could substantially reduce the anticipated benefit of the project 
the total projected cost of the facility consolidation project is now estimated at approximately million  which is million higher than original estimates 
more specifically  the following risks  among others  may limit the financial benefits of the facility consolidation project delays and further cost overruns in the construction of and equipment for the new facility are possible and could offset other cost savings expected from the consolidation  the facility consolidation project is likely to have a negative impact on the company s earnings during the construction period and the time during which operations are transitioned to the current site  the facility consolidation project may not eliminate as many redundant processes as the company presently anticipates  the company may not realize any future increase in demand for its products necessary to justify additional production capacity created by the facility consolidation  
table of contents the company may have problems or unexpected costs in transferring equipment or obtaining new equipment  the company may not be able to transfer production from its existing facilities to the new facility without a significant interruption in its business  moving the company s facilities to a new location may cause attrition in its personnel at levels that result in a significant interruption in its operations  and the company expects to incur additional annual compensation costs of approximately  to facilitate the retention of certain of its key personnel while the facility consolidation project is in process  the company may be unable to obtain amendments or waivers for any future non compliance with restrictive financial covenants under its credit facilities  the company may not receive the anticipated rental income for the unused portion of the current site  and the company may not be able to recover its investment in the original site 
if for any reason the company were to realize less than the expected benefits from the facility consolidation project  its future income stream  cash flows and debt levels could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the facility consolidation project is a long term project and unanticipated risks may develop as the project proceeds 
government regulation the company is subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  the united states environmental protection agency and other state and local authorities in jurisdictions where its products are manufactured  processed or sold 
among other things  these regulations govern the manufacturing  importation  processing  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products 
the company s manufacturing and processing facilities and products are subject to periodic compliance inspections by federal  state and local authorities 
the company is also subject to environmental regulations governing the discharge of air emissions  water and food waste  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
amendments to existing statutes and regulations  adoption of new statutes and regulations  increased production at the company s existing facilities as well as its expansion into new operations and jurisdictions  may require the company to obtain additional licenses and permits and could require it to adapt or alter methods of operations at costs that could be substantial 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect the company s business 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as possible criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
economic  political and social risks of doing business in emerging markets the company purchases a substantial portion of its cashew inventories from india  brazil and vietnam  which are in many respects emerging markets 
to this extent  the company is exposed to risks inherent in emerging markets  including increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy  greater likelihood of inflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  potential for contractual defaults or forced renegotiations on purchase contracts with limited legal recourse  tariffs and other barriers to trade that may reduce the company s profitability  and civil unrest and significant political instability 

table of contents the existence of these risks in these and other foreign countries that are the origins of the company s raw materials could jeopardize or limit its ability to purchase sufficient supplies of cashews and other imported raw materials and may adversely affect the company s income by increasing the costs of doing business overseas 
inventory measurement the company acquires its nut inventories from growers and farmers in large quantities at harvest times  which are primarily during the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year  and receives nut shipments in bulk truckloads 
the weights of these nuts are measured using truck scales at the time of receipt  and inventories are recorded on the basis of those measurements 
the nuts are then stored in bulk in large warehouses to be shelled or processed throughout the year 
bulk stored nut inventories are relieved on the basis of continuous high speed bulk weighing systems as the nuts are shelled or processed or on the basis of calculations derived from the weight of the shelled nuts that are produced 
while the company performs various procedures to periodically confirm the accuracy of its bulk stored nut inventories  these inventories are estimates that must be periodically adjusted to account for positive or negative variations in quantities and yields  and such adjustments directly affect earnings 
the precise amount of the company s bulk stored nut inventories is not known until the entire quantity of the particular nut is depleted  which may not necessarily occur every year 
prior crop year inventories may still be on hand as the new crop year inventories are purchased 
there can be no assurance that such inventory quantity adjustments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
farm bill the farm security and rural investment act of the farm bill terminated the federal peanut quota program beginning with the crop year 
the farm bill replaced the federal peanut quota program with a fixed payment system through the crop year that can be either coupled or decoupled 
a coupled system is tied to the actual amount of production  while a decoupled system is not 
the series of loans and subsidies established by the farm bill is similar to the systems used for other crops such as grains and cotton 
to compensate farmers for the elimination of the peanut quota  the farm bill provides a buy out at a specified rate for each pound of peanuts that had been in that farmer s quota under the prior program 
additionally  among other provisions  the secretary of agriculture may make certain counter cyclical payments whenever the secretary believes that the effective price for peanuts is less than the target price 
the termination of the federal peanut quota program has reduced the company s costs for peanuts  beginning in fiscal  and has resulted in a higher gross margin than the company has historically achieved 
the company may be unable to maintain these higher gross profit margins on the sale of peanuts  and the company s business  financial position and results of operations would thus be materially adversely affected 
the farm bill expires at the end of the crop year and will be replaced with new legislation 
at this time  the final contents of such legislation are unknown 
while there is no indication that the peanut quota program will be reestablished  there can be no assurance such a program  or one like it  will not be passed 
accordingly  the new legislation could alter the fixed payment system currently in place pursuant to the farm bill in a manner that could result in a material adverse affect on the company s operations 
public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of the company is subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of the bioterrorism act 
the bioterrorism act includes a number of provisions to help guard against the threat of bioterrorism  including new authority for the secretary of health and human services hhs to take action to protect the nation s food supply against the threat of international contamination 
the food and drug administration fda  as the food regulatory arm of hhs  is responsible for developing and implementing these food safety measures  which fall into four broad categories i registration of food facilities  ii establishment and maintenance of records regarding the sources and recipients of foods  iii prior notice to fda of imported food shipments and iv administrative detention of potentially affected foods 
there can be no assurances that the effects of the bioterrorism act and the rules enacted there under by the fda  including any potential disruption in the company s supply of imported nuts  which represented approximately of the company s total nut purchases in fiscal  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position or results of operations in the future

valentine the valentine group own or control common stock one vote per share and class a common stock ten votes per share representing approximately a voting interest in the company 
as a result  the sanfilippo group and the valentine group together are able to direct the election of a majority of the members to the board of directors 
in addition  the sanfilippo group is able to exert influence on the company s business that cannot be counteracted by another shareholder or group of shareholders 
the sanfilippo group is able to determine the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote of the company s stockholders  including any amendments to the company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
the sanfilippo group has the power to prevent a change in control or sale of the company  which may be beneficial to the public stockholders  or cause a change in control which may not be beneficial to the public stockholders  and can take other actions that might be less favorable to the company s stockholders and more favorable to the sanfilippo group  subject to applicable legal limitations 
in addition  several members of the sanfilippo group that beneficially own a significant interest in the company have pledged a substantial portion of the company s class a stock that they own to secure loans made to them by commercial banks 
if a stockholder defaults on any of its obligations under these pledge agreements or the related loan documents  these banks may have the right to sell the pledged shares 
such a sale could cause the company s stock price to decline 
many of the occurrences that could result in a foreclosure of the pledged shares are out of the company s control and are unrelated to the company s operations 
because these shares are pledged to secure loans  the occurrence of an event of default could result in a sale of pledged shares that could cause a change of control of the company  even when such a change may not be in the best interests of the company s stockholders  and it would also result in a default under the company s note agreement and bank credit facility

for example  by purchasing nuts directly from growers  processing the nuts and then marketing the end products to customers  the company is able to capture profit margins on the original purchase of the nuts 
in the past  the company s vertically integrated business model has worked to its advantage 
vertical integration  however  can under certain circumstances result in poor earnings or losses 
for example  during fiscal i the company bought too many nuts  such as almonds  directly from growers  ii subsequent to the company s purchases from growers  the market for certain nuts  such as almonds  declined  which impaired the company s ability to profit from its purchases and iii as a result of an overall increase in the price of nuts  consumption of nuts and nut products decreased 
the combination of these three factors  among others  contributed to the company s losses in fiscal and limited the company s ability to profit from its vertically integrated business model 

table of contents the risks associated with vertical integration that contributed to the company s negative margins for almond sales also exist  to varying degrees  for other nut types that the company shells 
accordingly  since the company is a vertically integrated sheller  processor and seller of nuts and nut products  the effects of changing market prices can never be eliminated 
the company s results for fiscal were disappointing in terms of both sales and earnings 
net sales decreased by to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  and sales volume measured in pounds decreased by  approximately of which was caused by fiscal containing fifty three rather than fifty two weeks 
the primary factor causing the decline in sales volume was the higher costs and related selling prices of tree nuts in fiscal when compared to fiscal  which led to decreased demand for nut products 
the company s decline in unit volume is consistent with trends throughout the entire nut category 
the company realized a net loss of million for fiscal compared to net income of million for fiscal in addition to the decline in sales volume  the effects of a declining market price of almonds  after the crop was procured at fixed prices  negatively affected the company s operating results for fiscal almonds in inventory at june  have been adjusted to the lower of cost or market 
it is anticipated that the almonds in inventory at june  will be sufficient to meet demand into the second quarter of fiscal consequently  the company expects zero gross profit on almond sales through this time period 
in order to help decrease the company s exposure to the effects of a possible recurrence of a declining almond market in fiscal  the company is changing its method of purchasing almonds 
to the extent practicable  the procurement will occur as industrial sales contracts are entered into  thus helping to reduce the company s exposure to the effects of changing market prices 
although the company is modifying its method for procuring almonds  there can be no assurance that this method will reduce the company s losses or the risks associated with buying almonds 
the company expects that the demand for nuts will improve in fiscal as lower prices are anticipated for most major nut types 
private label sales in the consumer distribution channel were negatively impacted by the high nut costs in fiscal the price differential between private label products and major branded products was very narrow in fiscal which hampered sales promotions of the private label products 
the anticipated lower nut prices for fiscal are expected to stimulate promotional activity in the private label market as lower prices increase consumer demand and the gap between private label and branded products returns to normal historical levels 
the high price of tree nuts also had a negative impact in the industrial distribution channel 
food processors decreased the usage of nuts in their products as a result of the higher price of tree nuts 
the company s unfavorable operating results have caused non compliance with certain restrictive covenants under its financing facilities throughout fiscal specifically  the company failed to achieve the minimum trailing fiscal four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda requirement  the maximum allowable funded debt to twelve month ebitda ratio  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the monthly minimum working capital requirement under its unsecured bank credit facility effective during fiscal the prior bank credit facility and the note agreement for the second and third quarters of fiscal and at june  in july  the company amended its prior bank credit facility into a secured bank credit facility the bank credit facility that also waived all non compliance with financial covenants through june  the note agreement was also amended to  among other things  waive all non compliance with financial covenants through june   increase the interest rate to from per annum  secure the company s obligations and modify future financial covenants 
on april   the company closed on the million purchase of a site in elgin  illinois the current site 
the current site includes both an office building and a warehouse 
the company is leasing of the office building back to the seller for a three year period  with options for an additional seven years 
the remaining portion of the office building may be leased to third parties  however  further capital expenditures  such as for increased parking availability  will be necessary to lease a substantial portion of the remaining space 
the  square foot warehouse was expanded to slightly over  square feet during fiscal and is being modified to serve as the company s principal processing and distribution facility and the company s headquarters 
the company transferred its primary chicago area distribution facility from a leased location to the current site in july processing operations are scheduled to begin at the current site in the second 
table of contents quarter of fiscal  with operations moving from the existing chicago area locations  and new equipment installed  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal and continuing on a gradual basis through the end of calendar in fiscal  in order to facilitate the facility consolidation project  the company s board of directors appointed an independent board committee to explore alternatives with respect to the company s existing leases for the properties owned by two related party partnerships 
after negotiations with the partnerships  the independent committee approved a proposed transaction and  subsequently  the company entered into various agreements with the partnerships 
the agreements provided for an overall transaction whereby i the current related party leases were terminated without penalty to the company  ii the company sold the portion of the busse road property that it owned to the partnerships for million  and iii the company sold its selma  texas properties to the partnerships for million an estimate of fair value which also slightly exceeds its carrying value and leased the properties back 
the sale price and rental rate for the selma  texas properties were determined by an independent appraiser to be at fair market value 
the lease for the selma  texas properties has a ten year term at a fair market value rent  with three five year renewal options 
in addition  the company has an option to repurchase the selma property from the partnerships after five years at in certain circumstances of the then fair market value  but not to be less than the million purchase price 
the sale of the selma  texas properties at fair market value to the related party partnerships was consummated during the first quarter of fiscal in march  the company and the related party partnership that owned a facility located in des plaines  illinois entered in to an agreement whereby the lease was terminated at no cost to the company upon the sale of the facility by the partnership 
the facility was sold by the partnership to a third party in march a gain of thousand was recorded as a reduction to administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal for the termination of this capital lease 
the portion of the busse road property that the company owned was sold to the related party partnership in july and the related lease obligation was terminated without penalty to the company 
the related party partnership then sold the busse road property to a third party  which is leasing back the property to the company for the time period necessary to transition operations to the new elgin facility 
proceeds received from the sales exceeded the company s carrying value of these assets by million 
in july  the company also sold its arlington heights and arthur avenue facilities to a third party for a total of million and is leasing back the facilities at fair market value for the time period necessary to transition operations to the current site 
proceeds received from the sales exceeded the carrying value of the assets by million 
the company faces a number of challenges in the future 
the company s chicago area processing facilities operate at full capacity at certain times during the year 
if the company experiences growth in unit volume sales  it could exceed its capacity to meet the demand for its products  especially prior to the completion of the facility consolidation project 
the company faces potential disruptive effects on its business  such as cost overruns for the construction of the new facility or business interruptions that may result from the transfer of production to the new facility 
for example  the total projected cost of the facility consolidation project is now estimated at approximately million  which is million higher than original estimates 
in addition  the company will continue to face the ongoing challenges of its business such as fluctuating commodity costs  food safety and regulatory issues and the maintenance and growth of its customer base 
see item a risk factors 
the company performed an analysis of its existing assets at its chicago locations  and based on this analysis identified those assets which will be transferred to the current site and those that will not 
for those assets which are not expected to be transferred to the current site  the remaining depreciation period has been reduced to reflect the company s estimate of the useful lives of these assets 
in addition to the assets being transferred  new machinery and equipment will also be installed at the current site 
the company currently anticipates that operations will be fully integrated into the current site by december total remaining capital expenditures for the facility consolidation project are estimated to be approximately million  which the company expects to finance through the 
table of contents bank credit facility  available cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of existing facilities and rental income from the office building at the current site 
several uncertainties exist  such as those described under item a risk factors 
prior to acquiring the current site  the company and certain related party partnerships entered into a development agreement with the city of elgin  illinois the development agreement for the development and purchase of the land where a new facility could be constructed the original site 
the development agreement provided for certain conditions  including but not limited to the completion of environmental and asbestos remediation procedures  the inclusion of the property in the elgin enterprise zone and the establishment of a tax incremental financing district covering the property 
the company fulfilled its remediation obligations under the development agreement during fiscal on february   the company and the related party partnerships entered into a termination agreement with the city of elgin whereby the development agreement was terminated and the company and the city of elgin the city became obligated to convey the property to the company and the partnerships within thirty days 
the partnerships subsequently agreed to convey their respective interests in the original site to the company by quitclaim deed without consideration 
on march   jbss properties  llc jbss llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired title to the original site by quitclaim deed  and jbss llc entered into an assignment and assumption agreement the agreement with the city 
under the terms of the agreement  the city assigned to the company all the city s remaining rights and obligations under the development agreement 
the company is currently marketing the original site to potential buyers 
the company s costs under the development agreement totaling million are recorded as other assets at june  and june  the company has reviewed the asset under the development agreement for realization  and concluded that no adjustment of the carrying value is required 
total inventories were approximately million at june   a decrease of million  or  from the balance at june  the decrease is due primarily to decreases in finished goods  almonds  cashews and peanuts 
the decreases in finished goods and cashews are due to management emphasis on inventory reduction in order to capitalize on anticipated market price declines in virtually all nuts in fiscal the decrease in almonds was due to lower purchases in fiscal than in fiscal overall volume of nut inventory  as measured by pounds on hand  decreased by at june  when compared to june  net accounts receivable were million at june   a decrease of approximately million  or  from the balance at june  the company s business is seasonal 
demand for peanut and other nut products is highest during the months of october  november and december 
peanuts  pecans  walnuts and almonds  the company s principal raw materials  are primarily purchased between august and february and are processed throughout the year until the following harvest 
as a result of this seasonality  the company s personnel requirements rise during the last four months of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at the company s chicago area facilities  with these facilities routinely operating at full capacity during the last four months of the calendar year 
the company s working capital requirements generally peak during the third quarter of the company s fiscal year

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or 
net sales would have increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  except that fiscal contained fifty three weeks rather than fifty two weeks 
unit volume  measured in terms of pounds shipped  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal unit volume sales decreases of in the consumer distribution channel and in the industrial distribution channel were primarily responsible for the overall decrease in unit volume sales 
the decrease in consumer sales volume was due primarily to lower sales of private label products 
sales volume of the company s fisher brand decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the private label decrease was caused in large part by the loss of private label business in the latter part of fiscal with customers that would not accept price increases 
also  market studies have shown a shift in consumer preference to branded snack nuts away from private label as the price differential between branded and private label products has narrowed 
market studies have also shown a decrease in overall nut category volume sales during fiscal the decrease in unit volume sales in the industrial distribution channel was caused primarily by reduced demand due to the higher costs of tree nuts 
unit volume sales decreased by and in the food service and contract packaging distribution channels  respectively  and increased by in the export distribution channel

product type fiscal fiscal peanuts pecans cashews mixed nuts walnuts almonds other total gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal decreased to million from approximately million for fiscal gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the two major factors for the significant decline in gross profit and gross profit margin were i a decline in production volume in fiscal compared to fiscal  and ii losses on almond sales due 
table of contents to a substantial decline in market costs after the procurement costs of almonds were fixed 
the major components contributing to the decrease in gross profit of million may be summarized as follows amount in millions impact of production volume decline decrease in gross profit on almond sales industrial almond contract loss reserve bulk stored inventory adjustments disposal and reserve for walnut and almond by products and packaging materials increase in workers compensation expense other the decreases in sales volume led to a corresponding decrease in production 
also  production further decreased due to a concerted effort to reduce finished goods inventory levels 
manufacturing expenses of a fixed nature do not decrease with the decrease in production 
accordingly  the production volume decline reduced the company s gross profit by million 
almonds also severely affected the company s profitability 
almond sales generated a decrease in gross profit of million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant decrease in the market price for almonds occurred after the company s costs to procure almonds were fixed 
the majority of the company s almond sales are to industrial customers on fixed price contracts 
for competitive reasons  the company entered into fixed price almond sales contracts at unfavorable prices with major customers in order to maintain good relationships 
a million reserve remained at june  for losses expected on the fulfillment of fixed price almond sales contracts during the first half of fiscal the company maintains significant quantities of bulk stored inshell inventories 
million in adjustments to increase the estimated quantities of bulk stored inventories were recorded during fiscal  while a million adjustment was recorded to decrease the estimated quantities of bulk stored inventories as of june   resulting in a million change in gross profit between fiscal and fiscal an increase in the processing of almonds and walnuts led to an increase in the production of by products 
the processes of slicing and slivering almonds inevitably result in the production of by products 
the walnut by products were caused by poor quality inshell walnuts that required additional reprocessing 
along with the identification of obsolete packaging materials  the generation of by products affected gross profit by million in fiscal workers compensation expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to a change in estimate in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal selling expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase of million in general advertising expenses 
administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal this increase was due primarily to million of expenses related to a supplemental retirement plan adopted in august and to a million increase in legal expenses relating primarily to the facility consolidation project and new financing arrangements  offset partially by the million gain from the termination of a related party capital lease 
loss income from operations 
due to the factors discussed above  the loss from operations was million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared to income from operations of million  or of net sales  for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal additionally  million of interest was capitalized pertaining to the company s facility consolidation project during fiscal this increase was caused primarily by higher average levels of borrowings and a higher interest rate on the company s revolving bank credit facility 

table of contents rental and miscellaneous expense income  net 
net rental and miscellaneous expense income was an expense of million for fiscal compared to income of million for fiscal the decrease of million was caused by expenses at the office building at the current site  including depreciation  exceeding rental income 
this net expense is expected to continue until a larger portion of the office building at the current site is rented 
income taxes 
income tax benefit was approximately million  or of loss before income taxes  for fiscal  compared to income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes  for fiscal net loss income 
net loss was million  or basic and diluted per common share  for fiscal  compared to net income of million  or basic per common share diluted  for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to higher prices related to higher commodity costs  especially for almonds and pecans 
also  fiscal contained fifty three weeks whereas fiscal contained fifty two weeks 
unit volume  measured in terms of pounds shipped  was virtually the same in fiscal and fiscal  and would have decreased slightly if not for the extra week in fiscal unit volume sales increased by in the food service distribution channel and by in the contract packaging distribution channel  but decreased by in the consumer distribution channel and by in the industrial distribution channel 
unit volume sales in the export distribution channel were virtually unchanged in fiscal when compared to fiscal food service volume increased due primarily to i higher airline sales  ii sales to new customers  and iii expanded sales to existing customers 
contract packaging volume increased significantly due to the introduction of new products and the expansion of business with a major customer 
consumer distribution channel volume decreased  due primarily to lower promotional activity for fisher peanut products at a major customer during the first half of fiscal and lost business with private label customers that would not accept price increases 
sales volume in the industrial distribution channel decreased due primarily to lower peanut sales as fiscal contained non recurring significant sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers

table of contents product type fiscal fiscal peanuts pecans cashews mixed nuts walnuts almonds other total gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal several factors led to the decrease in gross profit margin 
industrial sales are typically sold under calendar year fixed price contracts 
thus  industrial sales in the first half of fiscal that were priced based on prior year crop costs were fulfilled with current crop costs that were significantly higher  especially for pecans and almonds 
also  price increases in the consumer distribution channel due to the higher commodity costs were not fully instituted until the third quarter of fiscal other contributing factors leading to the decrease in gross profit margin include i contract packaging sales  which generally carry lower gross margins than the company s overall gross margins  accounting for a greater percentage of sales in fiscal than fiscal  ii unfavorable almond processing variances generated from the use of low quality almonds that were required to be purchased during the first quarter of fiscal to fulfill contracts  iii a higher than anticipated final settlement of million with almond growers for the crop year  and iv the scrapping of million of certain obsolete packaging materials in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses relative to a larger revenue base 
the approximately million increase in selling expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher freight and advertising costs of million and million  respectively  offset partially by a million decrease in incentive compensation 
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal the million decrease in administrative expenses was due primarily to lower incentive compensation expenses of million 
no bonuses were paid for fiscal under the company s incentive compensation program since the minimum earnings per share level was not attained 
partially offsetting the decrease in incentive compensation costs was an increase in professional expenses of million related primarily to corporate governance expenses 
income from operations 
due to the factors discussed above  income from operations decreased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the company s issuance on december   of million of ten year notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of under the note agreement to fund a portion of the company s facility consolidation project and for general working capital purposes 
average borrowings under the prior bank credit facility also increased to finance the increased purchase of inventories 
also  the interest rate on the prior bank credit facility increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to an increase in short term interest rates 
rental and miscellaneous income  net 
net rental and miscellaneous income increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase is due to rental income received from the lease back of the current site to the seller 
the office building at the current site is being leased for a minimum three year period  with options for an additional seven years 
the current monthly rental rate for the office building lease is thousand per month 
the warehouse building was leased back to the seller from april  to may  for thousand per month

net income was million  or basic per common share diluted  for fiscal  compared to million  or basic per common share diluted  for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources general the primary uses of cash are to fund the company s current operations  including its facility consolidation project  fulfill contractual obligations and repay indebtedness 
also  various uncertainties could result in additional uses of cash  such as those described under item a risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by net income but are also significantly influenced by inventory requirements  which can change based upon fluctuations in both quantities and market prices of the various nuts the company sells 
current market trends in nut prices and crop estimates also impact nut procurement 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal the increase is due primarily to a million decrease in inventory purchases  primarily in pecans  peanuts  cashews and almonds 
inshell pecan purchases decreased due to a decrease in the average cost of inshell pecans  with the quantity purchased relatively unchanged 
peanut purchases decreased due to higher quantities on hand at the beginning of fiscal compared to fiscal and to lower peanut sales in fiscal compared to fiscal cashew purchases decreased due to sufficient quantities already on hand in inventories at the beginning of the fiscal year 
almond purchases decreased due to a reduction in the demand for almonds in the industrial market 
overall nut purchases for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by in terms of pounds  and in terms of dollars 
the company focused on inventory reduction during fiscal in order to capitalize on anticipated market declines in virtually all nuts  except for pecans  during fiscal the company expects improved gross margins in fiscal  as the lower costs of nuts will not be offset by corresponding decreases in sales prices 
the company repaid million of long term debt during fiscal compared to million during fiscal financing arrangements on july   the company amended its prior bank credit facility into a secured facility the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility provides for million in secured borrowings and is comprised of i a working capital revolving loan which provides working capital financing of up to million in the aggregate  and matures on july   and ii million for the idb letter of credit maturing on june  to secure the industrial development bonds which finances the construction of a peanut shelling plant in the bank credit facility also allows for an amendment to increase the total amount of secured borrowings to million at the election of the company  the agent under the facility and one or more of the lenders under the facility 
borrowings under the bank credit facility accrue interest at a rate determined pursuant to a formula based on the agent bank s reference rate  the prime rate and the eurodollar rate 
the interest rate varies depending upon the company s quarterly financial performance  as measured by the available borrowing base 
the bank credit facility also waived all non compliance with financial covenants under the previous bank credit facility the prior bank credit facility that existed through june  as of june  the company had million of available credit under the prior bank credit facility 
the terms of the bank credit facility include certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  
table of contents require the company to maintain certain specified financial ratios if the borrowing base is below a designated level  restrict certain investments  indebtedness and capital expenditures and restrict certain cash dividends  redemptions of capital stock and prepayment of certain indebtedness of the company 
the lenders are entitled to require immediate repayment of the company s obligations under the bank credit facility in the event the company defaults on payments required under the bank credit facility  non compliance with the financial covenants  or upon the occurrence of certain other defaults by the company under the bank credit facility including a default under the note agreement 
the company is required to pay termination fees of and million if it terminates the bank credit facility in the first and second years of the agreement  respectively 
in order to finance a portion of the company s facility consolidation project and to provide for the company s general working capital needs  the company received million pursuant to a note purchase agreement the note agreement entered into on december  with various lenders 
the note agreement requires semi annual principal payments of million plus interest through december  as of june   the outstanding balance on the note agreement was million 
the company has the option to prepay amounts outstanding under the note agreement 
any such prepayment must be for at least of the outstanding amount at the time of prepayment up to
