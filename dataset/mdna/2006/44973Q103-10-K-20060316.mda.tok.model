item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
in  we determined that our method of classifying our investments in certain auction rate securities as cash and cash equivalents in our prior year financial statements was in error 
auction rate securities  for which interest rates reset in less than days  but for which the underlying maturity dates are longer than days  should have been classified as short term investments and available for sale securities 
we have restated our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and to correct this error 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their contract based  business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
we operate our business in two segments health and life sciences and industry solutions 
the health and life sciences line of business markets and sells our products and services to companies in the life sciences industries  including pharmaceutical and medical product companies  wholesale distributors and managed care organizations 
the industry solutions line of business targets all other industries  with an emphasis on consumer products  foodservice  disposables  oil gas energy  consumer durables  industrial products  chemicals  apparel  and telecommunications 
our primary products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest world wide pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual pharma revenues 
as the depth and breadth of our product suites have expanded  we have added companies in the industry solutions markets to our customer base 
we have generated revenues from both products and services 
product revenues which through mid had been principally comprised of software license fees generated from sales of i many cars and now include licensing of other products in our enterprise contract management software suite accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in service revenues include maintenance and support fees directly related to our licensed software products  professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software products and hosting fees 
service revenues accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in from june through march  we implemented a number of employee headcount reductions  which have been partially offset by employee additions through acquisitions and selective hiring  and we have taken other measures to better align our cost structure with projected revenues 
our aggregate spending on sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses has been reduced from million in the quarter ended june  to million in the quarter ended december  during and the first quarter of  actions taken to reduce our operating expenses included the closing of our chicago  illinois office  the significant downsizing of our london  england and portland  maine operations and selective other headcount reductions 
our total employee headcount has decreased from employees at december  to employees at december  and employees at december  on march   the shareholders of the company voted to reject a proposed merger among the company  selectica  inc and a subsidiary of selectica 
as a result  the merger agreement among the parties 
table of contents terminated 
under the terms of the merger agreement  selectica would have paid per share in cash for all outstanding shares of our common stock  for a total transaction value of approximately million 
in august  the company announced the departure of its chief executive officer  a 
leigh powell  and its chief operating officer  terrence m 
nicholson 
in connection with the resignation of these executives  we incurred  in future severance and benefit costs in also  yorgen edholm was appointed acting president and chief executive officer  and john a 
rade was appointed chairman of the board of directors with certain executive powers 
in february  mr 
edholm resigned as acting president and chief executive officer while remaining on the board of directors  and mr 
rade assumed his role as acting president and chief executive officer on an interim basis 
each of our acting chief executive officers was a member of the board of directors prior to his appointment and remains a member 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers and the expansion or renewal of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
in cases where significant production or customization is required prior to attaining technological feasibility of the software  license fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis and are credited to research and development expenses as a funded development arrangement 
after the software attains technological feasibility  recognizable license fees are reported as product revenue 
during the third quarter of  we became aware of certain defects in the current version of one of our software products  which was first shipped to customers in the fourth quarter of these defects  which were not identified in our pre release product testing  affected the performance of the software for a portion of our customers depending on each customer s particular implementation environment and its intended use of the software 
as of december   we have corrected all but one of the known performance defects  and are working to resolve the remaining defect 
because certain concessions have been made to customers in connection with these defects  we have generally not recognized revenue from sales of this software product and related implementation services in the third and fourth quarters of  except in those cases in which we determined that the customer was not likely to be affected by the known  unresolved software defects 
as of december   we have reversed and deferred million of otherwise recognizable license and professional service revenue  based in part on our estimate of the fair value of concessions to be made until the remaining defect is resolved  and partly on our determination that license fees were not fixed and determinable because of the possibility of future concessions 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our off site user training conferences 

table of contents maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer when sold separately  generally as renewals in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
in  we began offering current and prospective customers the option to enter into a subscription agreement as an alternative to our standard license contract model 
the standard subscription arrangement is presently a fixed fee agreement over three or more years  covering license fees  unspecified new product releases and maintenance and support  generally payable in equal quarterly installments commencing upon execution of the agreement 
most of the subscription arrangements entered into with customers have included one of a variety of conversion options that take effect after expiration of the contractual subscription term  such as i automatic conversion to a perpetual license  ii conversion to a perpetual license after two years of additional subscription payments  or iii payment of a perpetual option fee 
we recognize all revenue from subscription based arrangements ratably over the term of the subscription agreement commencing upon delivery of the initial product 
subscription arrangements constitute a growing proportion of our new licenses  and we anticipate that this growth will continue in during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and  respectively  in product revenue related to such agreements 
see the reconciliation table that follows under results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues in this item we account for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of our products as a reduction of revenue in certain circumstances 
to the extent that cumulative consideration earned by a customer or reseller during a reporting period exceeds revenue earned by the company from the customer or reseller  such excess is reported as sales and marketing expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
short term investments and available for sale securities investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than days and less than one year at time of purchase are classified as held to maturity investments and are recorded at amortized cost 
investments in auction rate debt securities  with maturities which can be greater than one year but for which interest rates reset in less than days  are classified as available for sale securities and are stated at fair market value 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the 
table of contents asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized until their lives are determined to be definite 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary items are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
product indemnification our agreements with customers generally include certain provisions obligating us to indemnify the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our products are found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right of a third party 
the agreements generally seek to limit the scope of remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no claims were outstanding as of december  we do not expect that any significant impact on financial position or the results of operations will result from these indemnification provisions 
research and development costs research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs incurred by the company between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have not been material 
as such  all software development costs incurred to date have been expensed as incurred 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or 
table of contents  to million for the year ended december  from the prior year  while service revenues decreased by  or  to million 
as indicated in the table below  the gross value of license contracts sold during increased by versus  due primarily to an increase in the average selling price as the number of license transactions minimum value of  decreased from to however  much of the revenue from the license transactions executed in was deferred to future reporting periods 
as we work to increase our sales in both of our reportable segments  we believe that a significant proportion of future license contracts will likewise be subscription arrangements or will have conditions  for example  software acceptance testing  resulting in deferral of license revenue recognition to later reporting periods 
as a result  in future reporting periods we expect recognized revenues to exclude much of the license revenue generated from contracts entered into in those periods but also to include larger proportions of revenues from contracts entered into in prior reporting periods 
reconciliation of value of license transactions to reportable product revenue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  amounts in thousands gross value of license contracts sold health and life sciences industry solutions add product revenue recorded in current period from contracts sold in prior periods health and life sciences subscriptions health and life sciences other deferrals industry solutions subscriptions industry solutions other deferrals less value of license contracts sold in current period and not currently recognizable health and life sciences industry solutions product revenue recorded health and life sciences industry solutions the above financial information is provided as additional information and is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we believe its inclusion can enhance an overall understanding of the our past operational performance and also our prospects for the future 
this reconciliation of product revenues is made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of our revenue performance  as opposed to gaap revenue results  which do not include the impact of newly executed subscription agreements and other deferred revenue arrangements that are material to the ongoing performance of our business 
this information quantifies the various components comprising current revenue  which in each period consists of revenues from licenses sold in current periods plus product revenue recorded in the current period from contracts sold in prior periods  less the value of license contracts sold in the current period that is not yet recognizable 
included in the gross value of license contracts sold amounts are license and non cancelable subscription fee obligations that are not currently recognizable as product revenue upon execution of the license 
table of contents agreement because all the requirements for revenue recognition see critical accounting policies above are not present  such as the presence of extended payment terms  future software deliverables  or customer acceptance provisions 
the gross value of license contracts sold also includes amounts that are not yet contractually billable to the customer and any such unbilled amounts are not yet reflected in deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet 
management uses this information as a basis for planning and forecasting core business activity in future periods and believes it is useful in understanding our results of operations 
the presentation of this additional revenue information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues reported in accordance with gaap in the united states 
total net revenues derived from the industry solutions segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  nearly all of this decrease is attributable to a reduction in license revenue as service revenues in this segment decreased by only  or  relative to as indicated in the above table  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during decreased by  or  relative to we believe this decrease in license sales is primarily attributable to a significant drop off in sales execution in the fourth quarter of relative to the three prior quarters of and does not indicate a market trend 
the fourth quarter sales results notwithstanding  we believe there is evidence of increasing demand for our new products in the enterprise contract management product suite  which are targeted primarily to customers in the industry solutions segment but are also gaining acceptance in the health and life sciences segment 
however  these new products are still in early stage releases  which continues to limit our ability to derive consistent revenues from them and to increase revenues in general 
in  we also deferred license and service revenues from certain customers with especially complex implementations of these new products 
until these new products have demonstrated a consistent record of performance in those installations  we intend to continue deferring revenue as appropriate 
total net revenues derived from the health and life sciences segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
decreases in this segment s product revenues and professional services revenues of million and million  respectively  were partially offset by a  increase in maintenance and support revenues 
as indicated in the table above  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during increased by million  or  relative to  although this increase was not reflected in revenues because of the deferral of much of the current year s transactions license revenue to future periods 
subscription arrangements constitute a growing proportion of our new license arrangements  and the proportion of revenue from new licenses that must be deferred to future periods is thus increasing  which in the short term has a negative impact on current quarter gaap revenue 
overall service revenues decreased by  or to million in the year ended december  versus million in this decrease was attributable to a million  or  decrease in professional services revenues  caused by reduced demand for consulting services  primarily in the health and life sciences segment  partially offset by a  or  increase in maintenance and support revenues  which was attributable to continued growth in our maintenance paying  installed customer base across both segments 
operating expenses cost of third party technology 
cost of third party technology  which consists of amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology  has not been significant historically 
cost of third party technology increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase is attributable to higher sales of contractmanager and compliancemanager  which incorporate third party technology 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor costs for providing professional services and maintenance and support services 
cost of services decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended 
table of contents december  a decrease in non cash stock compensation costs of  was partially offset by a  increases in salaries and related costs 
the decrease in non cash compensation costs resulted from non qualified option grants  which had an exercise price that was below market value at the time of grant  becoming fully vested during the fourth quarter of the increase in salaries and related costs was attributable to annual merit increases and an increase in aggregate technical support and professional services headcount from an average of during to an average of during as a percentage of service revenues  cost of services increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions amounted to million in the year ended december   which represents a  or  decrease in amortization from the year earlier period 
the decrease in amortization is attributable to the acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of vintage software  inc becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of  partially offset by an increase attributable to the acquisition of pricing analytics  inc in april sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
sales and marketing expense decreased by  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  a  decrease in salaries  commissions and related costs  attributable to a person reduction in average sales and marketing headcount during  and a  reduction in noncash compensation costs  attributable to non qualified option grants becoming fully vested during the fourth quarter of  was partially offset by increases in consulting and marketing promotion costs of  and  respectively 
as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expense increased to in versus in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a million reduction in noncash compensation costs  attributable to non qualified option grants becoming fully vested during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  and a  decrease in recruiting and miscellaneous office expenses was partially offset by an  increase in consulting expenses  reflecting an increase in the level of outsourcing of development work to cheaper offshore resources 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our administrative  finance  legal and human resources departments  insurance costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses consists principally of a  reduction in noncash compensation costs  attributable to non qualified stock option grants to employees becoming fully vested during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  and a  reduction in costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger with selectica  partially offset by  in severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with the august resignation of our former chief executive officer 
as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease is principally attributable to a significant drop off in the level of furniture  equipment and software additions from the years 
table of contents million and  to the years  and  the majority of these asset additions being depreciated over a three year life 
restructuring and other charges 
in the year ended december   we recorded  in credits related to efforts in prior years to streamline operations 
these credits resulted from reductions in the provisions for future lease costs for the chicago and london offices 
during the year ended december   in connection with the reduction of our leased space in london  england and the significant reduction in our portland  maine operation  as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate operations  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges 
also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort and incurred  in ongoing restructuring charges related to the chicago  illinois office that was closed in other income  net other income  net  increased by  or  from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  a  increase in interest income  attributable to significantly higher average yields  and  decrease in interest expense was partially offset by increases in state franchise taxes and foreign currency losses of  and  respectively 
we have not  in the past  hedged against risks related to foreign currency changes  and do not currently do so 
income taxes in  we recorded an  benefit arising from a refund related to the carry back of an operating loss to a pre acquisition fiscal period for our subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
other than this carry back benefit  we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards 
no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   while service revenues increased by million or

since the annual property and equipment additions during and million and million  respectively were significantly higher than the software and equipment additions in  and  this reduction in annual depreciation expense is expected to continue into 
table of contents amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of other acquired intangibles related to our acquisitions amounted to million in the year ended december   which represents a decrease of  or  from the amortization of million in this decrease is attributable to the discontinued amortization of acquired intangibles for chi cor information management  inc and bcl vision ltd  pursuant to full impairment asset write offs in june in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of pricing analytics  inc in april  we allocated  of the total purchase price to in process research and development  which was expensed upon consummation of the acquisition 
this allocation was based on an independent appraisal conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation was attributable to one in process research and development project  which consisted of the development of significant new features and functionality to an existing software product 
pricing analytics had achieved significant technological milestones on the project as of the acquisition date  but the project had not reached technological feasibility 
at the time of the acquisition  the project was approximately to complete 
we invested approximately  in the project following the acquisition 
the project s development progressed  in all material respects  consistently with the assumptions that we had used for estimating its fair value 
the project was completed in october impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in  we incurred impairment charges of million with respect to acquired intangible assets and million with respect to goodwill  in connection with our acquisitions of chicor and bcl 
no such charges were incurred during terminated deal transaction costs 
in  we incurred million in deal related transaction costs in connection with the proposed sale of our health and life sciences business to neoforma  inc no such charges were incurred during restructuring and other charges 
in connection with the reduction of our leased space in london  england and the significant reduction in our portland  maine operation  as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate operations  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges during the year ended december  also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort and incurred  in ongoing restructuring charges related to the chicago  illinois office that was closed in in  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges in connection with the closing of our offices in chicago and india and the downsizing of our london operation 
also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort  and we recorded a  charge representing the write down in value of various property and equipment assets 
other income  net other income  net  increased by  or  from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to an increase in interest income  which resulted from higher interest rates during income taxes in  we recorded an  benefit arising from a refund related to the carry back of an operating loss to a pre acquisition fiscal period for our subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
other than this carry back benefit  we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards 
no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources in and  we entered into several capital lease financing arrangements with a financial institution 
under the terms of the financings  the aggregate proceeds of million were deposited in a restricted bank account 
at december   these capital lease obligations had been paid in full and the corresponding restricted cash balance was redeemed 
the non current restricted cash balance of  at december  represents cash amounts held on deposit as security on two long term real property lease obligations 
in  we determined that the method of classifying our investments in certain auction rate securities as cash and cash equivalents in our prior year financial statements was in error 
auction rate securities  for which interest rates reset in less than days  but for which the underlying maturity dates are longer than days  should have been classified as short term investments and available for sale securities 
we have restated the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and to correct this error 
the effects of the restatement are disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k at december   we had net working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
also on december   we had no long term or short term debt  other than obligations under capital lease financings 
the million decrease in net working capital as compared to the million balance at december  was primarily attributable to a million decrease in combined cash and short term investments 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted principally of i the net loss of million  as offset by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million and noncash stock based compensation of  ii a decrease in accounts payable of  and iii an increase in prepaid expenses of  partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts payable was largely the result of the timing of payments  with the balance at december  being unusually high relative to prior and subsequent quarters 
the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily attributable to  in advance royalty payments to third party software developers during  a portion of which has since been amortized into expense 
the million increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to the net increase in the cumulative value of deferred license transactions  as documented in the table entitled reconciliation of value of license transactions to reportable product revenue included in the discussion of net revenues in this item for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  as offset by the following non cash items which total million depreciation and amortization of million  restructuring and other charges of million  in process research and development of  and non cash warrant  option and stock charges of million 
other uses of cash included a million decrease in accrued expenses  which was principally comprised of i million in lease and severance payments related to downsized facilities and employee severances  ii  reduction in the accrual related to discontinued self funded employee insurance programs  and iii  decrease in accrued consulting and professional service fees 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used of  for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million in net redemptions of short term investments and available for sale securities  partially offset by  in property and equipment additions and  in merger consideration paid in connection with the pricing analytics acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of  in merger consideration paid in connection with the pricing analytics acquisition and  in property and equipment additions  partially offset by  in net redemptions of short term investments and available for sale securities and a  decrease in restricted cash 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   consisting primarily of  in proceeds from warrant exercises and  in proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december   comprised of  of stock option and warrant exercises and stock purchase plan proceeds  partially offset by payments of  on existing capital leases 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  our profitability  possible acquisitions  the timing of expanded product offerings and the success of these offerings if and when they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with a sale of stock  our stockholders would experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
our current stock price may make it difficult for us to raise additional equity financing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without assuming significant risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting primarily of short term investment grade securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe there is no material risk exposure 
a change in interest rates  either positive or negative  would not have had a significant effect on interest income in the years ended december   and as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted entirely of money market investments with remaining maturities of days or less when purchased and non interest bearing checking accounts 
investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than days and less than one year are classified as held to maturity short term investments and are recorded at amortized cost 
under current investment guidelines  maturities on short term investments are restricted to one year or less 
investments in auction rate securities  with maturities which can be greater than one year but for which interest rates reset in less than days  are classified as available for sale securities and have been stated at fair market value 
at december   we held no auction rate certificates  having disposed of all our holdings in such investments during foreign currency exchange risk we operate in certain foreign locations  where the currency used is not the us dollar 
however  these locations have not been  and are not currently expected to be  significant to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates have not had a material effect on our business
