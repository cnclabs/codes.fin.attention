designing shapes with proportions unique to moissanite jewels 
maximizing the light reflected from a faceted moissanite jewel requires the design of shapes with unique proportions and angles 
we create proprietary designs  using computer modeling  to display the maximum light reflection based on the optical properties ie  refractive index  dispersion and luster of moissanite jewels 
the first shape we developed applying these computer models was a moissanite version unique facet angles and proportions of the standard round brilliant cut 
most recently  we have designed castle  square brilliant and baguette shapes 
we believe these proprietary designs are the basis for the superior optical performance quality observed in faceted moissanite jewels 
preforms 
we divide all sic crystals through slicing and dicing processes into preforms in sizes suitable for faceting into predetermined calibrated size moissanite jewels 
we use readily available automated and computerized equipment along with proprietary technology developed in house to slice and dice crystals into preforms 
we believe that this equipment will enable us to maximize the number of preforms we can obtain from each sic crystal 
faceting moissanite jewels 
the faceting of preforms is a critical stage in obtaining quality jewels 
the techniques and skills used in faceting moissanite jewels differ somewhat from those used in faceting diamonds and other gemstones 
we currently outsource the faceting of our moissanite jewels  other than faceting for research and product development purposes  which we conduct internally 
during  we intend to continue to outsource faceting services to our existing suppliers  and we will depend on their ability to provide an adequate quantity of quality faceted moissanite jewels 
we cannot be sure that they 
table of contents will be able to continue to produce our quality specifications for faceting and meet our quantity and time requirements 
currently  we have two suppliers of volume faceting services  both of which are located in asia  and we have been satisfied with the capabilities and performance of each of these suppliers 
we are currently seeking a third supplier of faceting services and it is our goal to have a third supplier in place during the majority of our faceting services currently are provided by john m 
bachman  inc jmb  as discussed below 
we do not have a long term agreement in place with our other supplier of volume faceting services 
in  we entered into a multi year agreement with jmb 
we have a right of first refusal to acquire any excess gemstone cutting capacity from jmb s affiliate and any equity securities offered by jmb or its affiliate 
our agreement with jmb expires march   however  we have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon days written notice 
under this agreement  jmb has agreed to grant  and to cause its affiliates to grant  to us a perpetual  non exclusive  royalty free license to use any inventions or proprietary information developed by or for jmb or its affiliates that is useful in the faceting of moissanite jewels 
the company presently intends to negotiate an extension of its agreement with jmb 
if no extension is agreed upon  management believes that alternative suppliers of faceting services would be available 
in april  we purchased from jmb used custom faceting machines for  in order to ensure that the machines were available in the event we had increased faceting requirements 
jmb agreed to store and maintain these machines and to repurchase the machines from us if higher faceting levels are required 
during we reached these increased monthly faceting levels and jmb repurchased the machines 
in may  we entered into an eighth amendment to our agreement with jmb 
pursuant to the terms of the amendment  the company has agreed to provide jmb with a cash advance of  to be used by jmb to expand its affiliate s production facility and procure additional equipment and labor as needed to enable jmb and its affiliate to satisfy the requested increase in production volumes 
the cash advance will be repaid to the company through reduced charges for future faceting services provided to the company 
as of december   the balance due to us on this advance is  we expect the advance to be completely repaid by the end of in march  we entered into a ninth amendment to our agreement with jmb 
pursuant to the terms of the amendment  the company has agreed with jmb on increased production levels and a new price schedule 
in addition  the term of our agreement with jmb was extended to march  inspection  sorting and grading 
once faceted moissanite jewels are returned to us  we inspect  sort and grade them 
during this stage  specially trained personnel individually examine and grade each moissanite jewel against certain quality parameters 
in addition  we process a sample of each batch through an image analyzer for exacting quality control 
this phase of manufacturing is relatively labor intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force 
in the future  we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to an independent third party 
we will require third parties to which we outsource these processes to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards 
we have no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain sufficient numbers of appropriately skilled personnel for this phase of manufacturing or find and enter into acceptable agreements with third party vendors or that such vendors will be able to provide accurate inspection  sorting and grading services on a timely basis 

table of contents marketing and distribution marketing domestic 
our primary market consists of self purchasing  women between the ages of and  with an annual income of at least  if married  combined household income of 
in through  we focused our message to be delivered to this market through consumer print advertising tagged to specific retailers  placed in fashion  lifestyle and women s consumer magazines 
we plan to continue delivering these consumer ads in we believe our marketing and advertising has continued to strengthen the image and reputation of our brand  charles colvard  and our product  moissanite jewels 
in late fourth quarter through our advertising message to the jewelry trade focused on moissanite jewelry being a new product category and a profitable business opportunity new customer base the self purchasing woman  higher average retail sales per item  product differentiation  higher profit margins  and a new source of revenue for both retailers and manufacturers 
we believe that no other gem material occupies the marketing niche called reward for achievement jewelry specifically focused on women self purchasers 
diamond occupies the market of jewelry symbolizing romance and a gift of love 
charles colvard will continue positioning moissanite as the perfect reward or indulgence for a woman celebrating her achievements large or small  personal or professional to its primary market  the self purchasing woman 
we continued to support our existing customers and moissanite retailers with marketing collateral  advertising  and public relations efforts 
we believe that this retailer marketing support program resulted in a consistent and positive message for moissanite 
it also set the stage for our future public relations and marketing efforts positioning moissanite as both a new product category in the jewelry industry  and a unique and desirable jewel for consumers 
in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of we participated with a major retailer  jcpenney  in supporting the introduction of moissanite jewelry into of its stores 
this support consisted of advertising in local and national newspapers  fashion  lifestyle  and women s magazines  and outdoor billboard advertising 
in addition  in we supported the rollout of moissanite jewelry in department stores with jewelry counters leased by finlay enterprises 
we plan to continue supporting our retailers with newspaper advertising  tagging them in our consumer publication ads  and supplying them with marketing materials designed to increase their moissanite jewelry sales 
public relations activities are an important component of our marketing strategy and are integral to supporting the launch of new moissanite retailers 
our key public relations activities in included the following generating coverage in fashion  jewelry industry trade  and general national press 
developing news stories to be carried on local television news programs and local newspaper markets throughout the us capitalizing on public relations activities that promote both charles colvard as a brand  and moissanite as product  including but not limited to sponsorships 
our sales and marketing efforts in will include  but not be limited to  increasing moissanite awareness and desire for ownership at the consumer level  through increased consumer advertising  a new and expanded public relations effort  headed by a new public relations firm recently engaged for the task  continuous sales training for the sales associates at the retail level  and individually tailored efforts for specific retailers 
our domestic marketing and public relations goal for is to increase consumer awareness for charles colvard created moissanite and thereby increase demand for moissanite jewels in our primary market 

table of contents we will focus primarily on public relations programs specifically designed to reach our primary market the self purchasing  independent decision making  woman  between the ages of and  with an annual income of at least  who takes pride in her achievements  is fashion conscious  influenced by style  and aspires to enrich her lifestyle 
we launched a new consumer lifestyle advertising campaign entitled moissanite is me which debuted in the fourth quarter of the campaign appeared in various publications that included elle  house beautiful  instyle  ladies home journal  oprah and vogue 
in  charles colvard will continue to advertise in jewelry trade publications such as jck and national jeweler 
we will continue positioning moissanite as a new product category with a unique business opportunity new customer base the self purchasing woman  higher average retail sales per item  higher profit margins  and a new source of revenue to the retailer 
international 
internationally  we work with our distributors to develop advertising and marketing campaigns targeting specific geographic regions  building on the marketing images  strategies  and themes developed in the united states 
pursuant to our international distribution agreements  we provide incentives to our customers to use advertising that supports the brand image for moissanite created by charles colvard 
we may provide other advertising and promotion incentives in international markets to increase jewelry trade and consumer awareness 
trade shows 
charles colvard will continue to participate in jewelry trade shows as an exhibitor 
in  we exhibited in the jck phoenix  baselworld in switzerland  hong kong jewellery show and the jck las vegas show 
also in  we participated in the vicenzaoro italy  and attended the jewelers of america shows in new york 
in  we plan to exhibit at jck invitational in new york  baselworld  jck las vegas  the hong kong jewellery shows and certain other international jewelry trade expositions 
distribution domestic 
we believe that moissanite is best sold through retail channels in which the retailer has an adequate opportunity to effectively educate the consumer on moissanite s unique qualities 
we began shipping moissanite to our authorized retail jewelers in atlanta and miami ft 
lauderdale during the second quarter of  and in july we launched limited consumer focused advertising and promotion activities in those areas 
during the second half of  and through the first half of  we limited our efforts to expand the distribution of moissanite jewels as a result of insufficient product availability and our lack of confidence in the quality of the sic crystals we were receiving 
as our confidence in our supply of moissanite increased  we attempted to expand the number of retailers carrying moissanite during the second half of however  we were not able to increase the number of these jewelers necessary to achieve our business objectives in by the end of  domestic independent jewelers were carrying charles colvard created moissanite 
sales in to our independent jewelers totaled approximately million 
in order to more rapidly expand the distribution of moissanite  in may we transitioned from selling moissanite jewels directly to independent retail jewelers to allowing independent retail jewelers to access loose moissanite jewels and moissanite jewelry through two established jewelry distributors  stuller settings  inc and rio grande 
additionally  we have entered into arrangements with several jewelry manufacturers  most notably k g creations and reeves park  that design and manufacture lines of jewelry containing moissanite jewels 
jewelry retailers have access to loose moissanite jewels from stuller and rio grande and to jewelry containing moissanite jewels from stuller  k g creations  reeves park and other jewelry manufacturers 

table of contents we believe that moissanite jewels provide retailers with an opportunity to earn a profit margin that compares favorably to other jewelry products and allow retailers to distinguish our product line from other jewelry in the highly competitive retail jewelry market 
we also believe these margins create incentives for retailers to maximize their sales and promotional efforts  resulting in additional consumer demand for our moissanite jewels 
we believe that distributing moissanite jewels through distributors as well as certain jewelry manufacturers and designers provides retail jewelers with maximum flexibility to develop their businesses with moissanite 
those jewelers that prefer to create their own jewelry to meet the needs of their individual market areas will be able to purchase the loose jewels through distributors  with which many of them already have relationships 
those jewelers that wish to purchase finished jewelry for sale in their stores may do so either through distributors or any of the jewelry manufacturers working with moissanite 
the quality  design and workmanship of the settings chosen by distributors  manufacturers  designers and retailers affects consumer perception and acceptance of our jewel  and our control over these elements is limited to our pricing and licensing policies 
beyond that  we believe that the success of charles colvard created moissanite will be determined by the power and the precision of our brand building program 
we continue to evaluate the most appropriate structure for distribution in north america and may  in certain circumstances  enter into additional distribution arrangements  including arrangements with selected department stores and distribution channels such as moissanite retail stores  catalog sales or internet sales 
as our retail customer base has grown and we have gained distribution with prominent regional and national outlets  we believe we are beginning to see the benefit of our distribution model 
by combining the manufacturers strength of jewelry design and program execution with our beautiful jewel  our distribution message is that we can provide a compelling revenue pipeline to retailers 
several manufacturers have successfully introduced moissanite with multi door chains 
in  we supported our manufacturing customer s efforts in expanding and developing distribution with several notable retailers 
these include but are not limited to shopnbc  shop at home  landau  army air force exchange system aafes  and morgan jewelers 
in  we supported additional traditional retailer test distributions at kings jewelers and carlyle company  as well as a number of other retailers 
in  new distribution occurred at boscov s  daniel s  migerobe  alvin s and jcpenney became the first national retail chain to carry moissanite jewelry in of its stores 
expansion occurred at aafes  kings jewelers and landau  as well as a number of other retailers 
in  moissanite jewelry became available at finlay leased department store jewelry counters by april with an expansion into of the finlay counters as of december  finlay enterprises operates leased department store jewelry locations in chains such as boston store  macy s  dillard s  bloomingdale s  belks and marshall fields 
during  we have also seen expanded distribution into rhomberg jewelers  a store chain in switzerland  harry ritchie  an upscale rd generation regional jewelry chain with locations in the northwest  expanded from to boscov s department stores  expanded from to all of the migerobe operated leased jewelry departments within saks inc department stores and increased the number of jcpenney stores offering moissanite jewelry to stores 
our two largest customers  k g creations and reeves park  each accounted for in the aggregate of our sales during our third largest customer  stuller settings  inc accounted for of our sales during and is our biggest supplier to independent retail jewelers 
through our efforts with reeves park  jcpenney was the first national retail chain to carry moissanite jewelry 
through our efforts with k g creations moissanite jewelry was rolled out to a portion of the department stores whose jewelry counters are leased to finlay enterprises 
in addition  we have collaborated with our customers to expand distribution with other retailers 
while we believe our current relationship with these customers is good  and alternate manufacturers and distributors are available to serve their customer base  a loss of these customers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of 
table of contents operations in a particular period 
we expect that  at least over the short term  we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our manufacturing customers to maintain and enhance the jcpenney and finlay enterprises programs 
during  we conducted test distribution at two national fine jewelry stores via one day trunk show events 
helzberg jewelers  a store fine jewelry chain  began testing moissanite jewelry in september and gordon s jewelers  a store fine jewelry division of zale corporation  began testing in october based on the results of the test distribution  helzberg has decided to begin an in case program of fine moissanite jewelry at approximately locations in the first quarter of the tests at gordon s will continue in the first quarter of additionally  other divisions of the zale corporation that are scheduling trunk shows in are the store zale outlet chain in the us and peoples jewelers  a store chain owned by zale canada 
we believe that we have developed a testing template that can enable us to gain distribution 
generally  we seek to participate with the retailers in training their sales and marketing personnel in moissanite sales positioning and strategies and in working with them to create focused advertising and promotional efforts to publicize trunk shows and other special sales events at the test store locations 
in addition  to facilitate new distribution  we have allowed inventory to be taken on a consignment basis 
charles colvard recognizes revenue on consignment shipments on the earlier of the sale of the jewelry by the retailer or the retailer or manufacturer agreeing to take ownership of the jewels without recourse 
the  of inventory on consignment at december  represents potential revenue of approximately  and potential gross profit of approximately  based on the average cost per carat of inventory at december  we believe that our sales on television shopping channels demonstrated that the consumer understands the value and beauty of our jewel and has resulted in increased interest from key traditional jewelry retailers such as those described above 
we will also continue to seek other non traditional channels such as catalog  showrooms  mail order  tv shopping channels  internet  department store  specialty stores and mass retail 
we believe that the growing consumer acceptance of moissanite will allow charles colvard to expand into these various channels 
as we expand  we will manage the issues surrounding the multiple channel distribution method with the need for a consistent brand building program 
aggregate us sales were approximately million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
we plan to add additional sales professionals in to focus on new retailer training 
the additional personnel will enable us to increase our presence at trade shows and other important sales opportunities 
international 
we currently distribute moissanite jewels in substantially all of western europe  australia  india and certain countries in southeast asia and the middle east 
we have approximately international distributors and intend to increase this number 
all sales to international customers are denominated in us dollars 
generally  we require full payment before merchandise is shipped to these customers 
however  once a customer has established a purchase history  we may grant payment terms to our international customers 
export sales aggregated approximately million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
similar to the us  we have begun distributing through tv retailers internationally 
specifically  we have developed partnerships with our manufacturing customers at ideal world shopping in the uk  viva tv network in taiwan  jupiter shop channel in japan  and m boutique la chaine in france 
we believe that we are positioned for future growth in this distribution channel 
we have also continued our investment in the asian market 
our hong kong office is working on obtaining business relationships that will expand our distribution through southeast asia 
one of those manufacturing customers  aaron shum jewelry  ltd  is supplying the test distribution at gordon s jewelers in the us 
table of contents competition gemstone materials can be grouped into three types natural gemstone  which is found in nature  synthetic gemstone  which has the same chemical composition and characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab  and simulated or substitute material  which is similar in appearance to natural gemstone but does not have the same chemical composition 
our moissanite jewel  which is positioned as a unique new jewel  may compete with fine gemstones such as ruby  sapphire  emerald and tanzanite as well as with natural  synthetic  and treated diamonds and existing synthetic gemstones such as synthetic cubic zirconia 
we may also face competition from additional gemstones such as synthetic diamonds  synthetic diamond films and other sources of synthetic moissanite not presently available in qualities  sizes and volumes suitable for use as gemstones 
many of the suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones  as well as the suppliers of synthetic gemstones  have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do 
the worldwide market for large  uncut high quality diamonds is significantly consolidated through the diamond trading company  a company controlled by debeers 
this company has a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of these diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels 
although we believe that our jewels appeal primarily to the consumer who would not otherwise purchase comparable diamond jewelry  diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels 
we may also face competition from treated diamonds 
treated diamonds  which are natural diamonds with imperfections or flaws that have been altered in some manner to enhance their appearance  are presently available in the jewelry industry and are generally less expensive than diamonds of similar size  cut and color which have not been altered 
synthetic diamonds are available in the marketplace and may compete with our jewels 
synthetic diamonds are regularly produced for industrial applications  but we believe that gemstone quality synthetic diamonds presently cannot be produced at prices competitive with those currently offered for our near colorless moissanite jewels 
the primary producers of these synthetic diamonds are debeers  sumitomo and ge 
there are also a number of russian producers of synthetic diamonds for industrial uses 
in addition  companies such as the gemesis corporation and apollo diamonds are working to develop cost effective means of producing gem quality synthetic diamonds 
synthetic diamond films can be grown at commercially viable prices in thicknesses that can be applied to other surfaces 
although we believe that our products have a proprietary position  we could face competition from other companies that develop competing sic technologies 
some of these technologies could be developed by producers of sic used for other industrial applications 
manufacturers of industrial sic products include the carborundum corporation  for abrasive uses  and cree  siemens ag  norstel ab  bridgestone abb  dow chemical  intrinsic semiconductor and northrup grumman corporation  for semiconductor uses 
we believe that cree  norstel ab and intrinsic semiconductor  are currently the only suppliers of sic crystals in colors  sizes and volumes suitable for gemstone applications 
it is possible  however  that these or other producers of sic could develop sic crystals suitable for gemstone applications and produce moissanite jewels until we could obtain judicial enforcement of our patent rights 

table of contents we may also face competition from synthetic cubic zirconia  the principal existing diamond simulant and  to a lesser degree  other synthetic gemstones 
the largest producer of synthetic cubic zirconia gemstones is signity 
in addition  there are a significant number of other producers of jewelry containing synthetic gemstones 
three of the largest retailers of synthetic cubic zirconia jewelry in the united states are qvc  home shopping network and wal mart 
some of the major retailers of synthetic cubic zirconia  including qvc  have captive manufacturing divisions that produce synthetic cubic zirconia jewelry 
these producers and sellers may see their markets being eroded by the introduction of our moissanite jewels 
we believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels 
we intend to compete primarily on the basis that the unique qualities of our moissanite jewels are distinct from all other jewels based on their fire  brilliance  luster and durability 
in addition  we believe that the charles colvard created moissanite brand  which is being developed pursuant to our marketing program  can create a long term competitive advantage for our products 
additionally  we believe that moissanite jewels have a significant cost advantage over other fine gemstones  especially in the one carat size and larger 
our competitive success depends  in part  on the following the willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers  manufacturers and designers to market and promote moissanite jewels to the retail jewelry trade  the willingness of distributors  retailers and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose moissanite jewels and the willingness of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels  the ability of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our jewels  the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in jewelry with high quality workmanship  and the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell moissanite jewelry to consumers 
government regulation our products are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission ftc 
the ftc has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials 
while we intend to comply fully with all ftc regulations  we cannot be sure that the ftc or a competitor will not challenge our promotional or marketing activities 
such a challenge could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management  whether or not such challenge is resolved in our favor 
if our actions were found to be in violation of ftc regulations  we could be forced to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate ftc regulations 
employees at february   we had employees 
we believe that our future prospects will depend  in part  on our ability to retain our current employees and to obtain additional management  marketing  sales  manufacturing  scientific and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is substantial  and the number of persons with relevant experience in the jewelry industry is limited 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union

risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  you should carefully consider the following important factors that in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual performance and results and could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
our business operations could be adversely affected if we do not manage our growth effectively 
our strategy will require us to achieve rapid growth while limiting expenditures and motivating our employee base 
periods of rapid growth may place a significant strain on our personnel and other resources 
we will continue to be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties 
our strategy is to rapidly commercialize moissanite jewels by building consumer brand awareness and growing distribution channels for our jewels 
the timing of or potential for a significant increase in revenues is dependent on increasing market acceptance of moissanite jewels and increasing distribution and sales 
our business may also be subject to risks inherent in rapid increases in sales and production levels 
likewise  our products are subject to risks inherent in the development and marketing of new products  including unforeseen design  manufacturing or other problems or failure to develop market acceptance 
failure by us to expand distribution and achieve market acceptance of our products or to develop the ability to produce our products in higher quantities  while maintaining quality  would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
accordingly  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in a growth stage of development  particularly operating in the early stages of manufacturing and distributing unproven products 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
our future financial performance depends upon continued growth and consumer acceptance of our products 
we believe that many retail jewelers and most consumers are not generally aware of the existence and attributes of moissanite jewels 
the market for moissanite jewels among retail jewelers and consumers is in the early stages of development  as we shipped approximately  carats during the year ended december  the degree of future market acceptance and demand are subject to a significant amount of uncertainty 
our future financial performance will depend upon greater consumer acceptance of the company s moissanite jewels as distinct from all other jewels based on their fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
in addition  consumer acceptance may be impacted by retail jewelers and jewelry manufacturers acceptance of moissanite jewels 
we market loose jewels which jewelry distributors  manufacturers and retailers set in jewelry and in turn distribute or sell to consumers 
the quality  design and workmanship of the jewelry settings selected by retail jewelers  which is not within our control  could impact our consumers perception and acceptance of our jewels 
thus  our future financial performance may be impacted by the willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers  manufacturers and designers to market and promote moissanite jewels to the retail jewelry trade  the willingness of distributors  retailers and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose moissanite jewels and the willingness of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels  the ability of manufacturers  designers and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our jewels  the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in jewelry with high quality workmanship  and the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell moissanite jewelry to consumers 

table of contents if our products do not receive greater market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we are substantially dependent on the sale of our jewels in north america through k g creations a jewelry manufacturer and distributor  reeves park a jewelry manufacturer and stuller settings  inc a jewelry distributor and manufacturer as well as a limited number of other distributors and jewelry manufacturers 
we anticipate that the majority of the moissanite jewels that we sell in north america will be distributed through k g creations  reeves park and stuller as well as a limited number of other manufacturers and distributors  and therefore  we are substantially dependent upon these companies for distribution of moissanite jewels in north america 
through our efforts with reeves park  jcpenney was the first national retail chain to carry moissanite jewelry 
through our efforts with k g creations moissanite jewelry was rolled out to a portion of the department stores whose jewelry counters are leased to finlay enterprises 
we expect that  at least over the short term  we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our manufacturing customers to maintain and enhance the jcpenney and finlay programs 
a prolonged economic downturn and the uncertainties caused by war or terrorism could adversely affect our operations 
purchases of jewelry  including purchases of our products  may be affected by any prolonged  negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending 
any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income may adversely affect jewelry companies  in general  and our company  in particular  more significantly than companies that rely less on discretionary consumer spending 
further  the affect that war and possible additional terrorist attacks may have on consumers and the economies of the united states  as well as other countries in which our products are sold  is unpredictable and uncertain 
any significant reduction in demand for our products would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and could  if it continued  have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
we are subject to certain risks due to our international distribution channels and vendors 
charles colvard created moissanite jewels are currently being distributed in substantially all of western europe  australia  india  and certain countries in southeast asia and the middle east 
we currently have a total of approximately international distributors 
our long term strategy is to expand the number of international markets for our products 
in addition  we expect to continue to use certain companies based outside the united states to facet our moissanite jewels 
due to our reliance on development of foreign markets and use of foreign vendors  we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include the following the adverse effects on united states based companies operating in foreign markets that might result from war  terrorism  changes in diplomatic  trade or business relationships or other political  social  religious or economic instability  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  while all foreign transactions are denominated in us dollars  foreign currency fluctuations could impact demand for our products or the ability of our foreign suppliers to continue to perform 
further  some of these distributors operate relatively small businesses and may not have the financial stability to assure their continuing presence in their markets 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our anticipated business practices 
we currently depend upon cree for the supply of a substantial majority of our sic crystals 
we currently depend on cree for the supply of a substantial majority of sic crystals that we use in our 
table of contents business 
cree has certain proprietary rights relating to its process for growing large single crystals of sic and its process for growing colorless sic crystals 
under our exclusive supply agreement with cree  we are obligated to buy from cree  and cree is obligated to sell to us  at least  by dollar volume  of our requirements for sic material for the production of gemstones in each calendar quarter 
in february  we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel ab  however  norstel ab has only demonstrated that it can produce suitable raw material in limited quantities and is not expected to produce significant amounts of moissanite at least until after mid when its new plant which is currently under construction is scheduled to become operational 
in november  we signed an agreement with intrinsic semiconductor who has not as yet proven that they can produce significant amounts of moissanite at a quality acceptable to us 
therefore  we remain dependant on cree for a substantial majority of our principal raw material 
while cree has improved its production processes and is currently producing sic crystals sufficient to meet our requirements  we experienced difficulties in the past in obtaining crystals from cree in the quality  sizes and volumes that we desired 
we from time to time enter into purchase agreements with cree with respect to our purchase commitments and the specific timing  pricing and other terms of future delivery of sic crystals 
there can be no assurance that cree will be able to continue to produce and supply us with raw materials of sufficient quality  sizes and volumes that we desire nor that we will successfully negotiate purchase commitments that enable us to manage our inventories and raw material costs effectively 
in addition  although norstel ab and intrinsic semiconductor represent potential additional sources of supply  norstel ab and intrinsic semiconductor do not presently have the capacity to produce significant quantities of sic of suitable quality and sizes  and there can be no assurance that they will ever develop these capabilities 
we rely upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we have united states product and method patents for moissanite jewels under which we believe that we have broad  exclusive rights to manufacture  use and sell moissanite jewels in the united states 
we have these same patents in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
we believe that these patents create substantial technological barriers to our potential competitors 
we also have other patents and patent applications pending related to certain methods of producing moissanite jewels and related technologies 
there can be no assurance that any other patents will be granted or that any issued patent will have any commercial or competitive value 
at the present time  we are also dependent on cree s technology for the production of sic crystals 
cree is exclusively licensed to use a patent concerning a process for growing large single crystals of sic  has certain patents of its own relating to growth of large single crystals of sic and has a patent for a process for growing colorless sic crystals 
if norstel ab and intrinsic semiconductor become significant additional sources of supply  we will also become dependent on their technology 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by or to us  cree  norstel ab  or intrinsic semiconductor will provide any significant commercial protection  that we  cree  norstel ab  or intrinsic semiconductor will have sufficient resources to prosecute our respective patents or that any patents will be upheld by a court should we  or our suppliers seek to enforce our respective rights against an infringer 
the existence of valid patents does not prevent other companies from independently developing competing technologies as evidenced by our agreements with norstel ab and intrinsic semiconductor 
existing producers of sic or others may refine existing processes for growing sic crystals or develop new technologies for growing large single crystals of sic or colorless sic crystals in a manner that does not infringe patents owned or licensed by us or cree 
in addition  existing producers of sic  existing producers of other synthetic or natural gemstones or other parties may develop new technologies for producing moissanite jewels in a manner that does not infringe patents owned or licensed by us or cree 
as a result of the foregoing factors  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with or superior to our products  and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our success depends upon our ability to identify  reach agreements with and work successfully with third parties 
in addition to our current dependence on cree and on third party distribution channels  our prospects depend upon our ability to identify  reach agreements with and work successfully with other third parties 
in particular  we rely on third parties to facet our jewels 
faceting moissanite jewels requires different techniques than faceting diamond and other gemstones 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain our relationships with our faceting vendors on terms satisfactory to us or that faceting vendors will continue to be able to provide faceting services in the quality and quantities required by us or that we will be able to find suitable replacements if we are unable to maintain such relationships 
our failure to achieve any of the above would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
governmental regulation and oversight might adversely impact our operations 
we are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels 
in particular  the federal trade commission has the power to restrict the offer and sale of products that could deceive or have the tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers with regard to its type  kind  quality  character  origin or other characteristics 
we may be under close scrutiny both by governmental agencies and by competitors in the gemstone industry  any of which may challenge our promotion and marketing of our moissanite jewel products 
if our production or marketing of moissanite jewels is challenged by governmental agencies or competitors  or if regulations are issued that restrict our ability to market our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our reputation amongst jewelers and consumers could be damaged if low quality gemstones or synthetics are marketed as moissanite 
it is possible that low quality gemstones or other synthetics could be marketed as moissanite 
the sale of low quality products as moissanite could damage our ability to foster the perception of moissanite as a unique jewel that compares favorably to other fine gemstones like diamond  ruby and emerald 
this could damage our reputation among retail jewelers and consumers and result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products 
the introduction of low quality imitation moissanite jewels and our inability to limit the adverse effects thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
some anti takeover provisions of our charter documents  agreements and plans may delay or prevent a takeover of our company 
a number of provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws impact matters of corporate governance and the rights of shareholders 
certain of these provisions have an anti takeover effect and may delay or prevent takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors including takeovers that certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions also could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by shareholders 
we believe that these provisions are appropriate to protect our interests and all of our shareholders 
under the terms of the exclusive supply agreement  we are prohibited from entering into an exclusive marketing or distribution agreement with debeers or its affiliates or any party whose primary business is the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of diamond gemstones or any non gemstone and non jewelry industry competitor of cree 
the agreement also prohibits us from entering into certain merger  acquisition  sale of assets or similar transactions with a prohibited party 
these provisions of the exclusive supply agreement with cree could limit the price that third parties might be willing to pay in the future for some or all of the shares of our common stock 
in addition  this agreement could prevent us from entering into certain potentially profitable transactions with such prohibited parties 
on february   we adopted a shareholder rights plan under which all shareholders of record as of march   received rights to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock 
each share of common stock issued after march  has received the same rights 

table of contents the rights plan is designed to enable all of our shareholders to realize the full value of their investment and to provide for fair and equal treatment for all shareholders in the event that an unsolicited attempt is made to acquire us 
the adoption of the rights plan is intended as a means to guard against abusive takeover tactics and is not in response to any particular proposal 
the rights  which expire in  will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  all shareholders except the purchaser will be entitled to acquire our common stock at a discount 
the effect will be to discourage acquisitions of more than of our common stock without negotiations with the board of directors of the company 
the rights will trade with our common stock  unless and until they are separated upon the occurrence of certain future events 
our board of directors may redeem the rights prior to the expiration of a specified period following the acquisition of more than of our common stock

the following discussion and the section in item a of this report entitled risk factors describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteors 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to establish charles colvard as a reputable  high quality and sophisticated brand and position moissanite as a unique jewel  distinct from all others based on its exceptional fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
moissanite is marketed to its primary target market  the self purchasing woman  as the perfect reward or indulgence for a woman celebrating her achievements  whether personal or professional  big or small 
moissanite is also marketed to the trade as a new jewelry category with a unique business opportunity 
we began shipping moissanite to us retail jewelers and international distributors during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we changed our us distribution model to sell through jewel distributors and jewelry manufacturers rather than directly to retail stores 
in march  we entered into distribution agreements with stuller settings  inc and rio grande  two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  for the north american distribution of moissanite 
we have also entered into several agreements with us jewelry manufacturers  including k g creations and reeves park  which are currently our two largest customers 
through these agreements with distributors and jewelry manufacturers and the brand awareness created by our marketing program  we have sought to rapidly increase the introduction of moissanite into the us jewelry market while maintaining average selling prices 
although these distribution and marketing strategies enabled us to achieve profitability in each of the last five fiscal years  we have no assurance that these strategies will be successful in the long term 
in october  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong  charles colvard hk ltd  for the purpose of gaining better access to the important far eastern markets 
the importance of having a presence in this market is twofold  hong kong is the headquarters city for a very large number of jewelry manufacturing companies with sales and distribution worldwide  and hong kong is the gateway to the markets of mainland china 
to enhance our presence in this market  we established a charles colvard controlled company in china in august during  we increased our sales and marketing expenses to expand product awareness and provide support to retailers to continue our sales growth 
the majority of the increased expenses were focused on the us market however we also increased our marketing and sales investment in hong kong and china 
our sales were higher in over during  we continued our increased investment in sales and marketing expenses to accelerate our growth rate 
our sales in were higher than and we remained profitable 
during  our goal continued to be to increase revenue through an increased investment in sales and marketing expenses  while maintaining profitability 
our sales during were higher than sales 
table of contents in  while our sales marketing expenses were higher than our sales in were favorably impacted by our expanding relationships with two major jewelry retailers  jcpenney and finlay enterprises  inc in a joint effort with our manufacturing customer  reeves park  we launched a charles colvard moissanite jewelry category at jcpenney retail locations in october in march  jcpenney began offering moissanite in additional stores 
while the majority of the distribution at jcpenney is through asset purchase  current distribution consists of a mixture of asset purchase and consignment 
finlay  supplied by our manufacturing customer k g creations  operates leased department store jewelry locations in chains such as boston store  macy s  dillard s  bloomingdale s  belks and marshall fields 
finlay initially offered moissanite jewelry in stores on february  as of december   moissanite jewelry is available at approximately finlay leased department store jewelry counters 
while the distribution at finlay is through asset purchase  consignment is being used for special promotions  such as trunk shows 
during  we conducted test distribution at two national fine jewelry stores via one day trunk show events 
helzberg jewelers  a store fine jewelry chain  began testing moissanite jewelry in september and gordon s jewelers  a store fine jewelry division of zale corporation  began testing in october based on the results of the test distribution  helzberg has decided to begin an in case program of fine moissanite jewelry at approximately locations in the first quarter of the tests at gordon s will continue in the first quarter of additionally  other divisions of the zale corporation that are scheduling trunk shows in are the store zale outlet chain in the us and peoples jewelers  a store chain owned by zale canada 
our goal for is to grow revenue while remaining profitable by increasing awareness and demand for our jewel  moissanite 
our domestic sales and marketing efforts will include  but not be limited to  increasing moissanite awareness and desire for ownership at the consumer level  through increased consumer advertising  a new and expanded public relations effort  headed by a new public relations firm recently engaged for the task  continuous sales training for the sales associates at the retail level  and individually tailored efforts for specific retailers 
internationally  in we will maintain our commitment to asia and commit additional resources in the united kingdom and continental europe 
we understand and accept that our growth in those markets will likely continue to be slow  but by insisting that our distribution partners understand and support our marketing positioning we believe that they will start to gain a meaningful presence for moissanite jewelry in their markets 
results of operations the following table is intended to illustrate a tabular analysis of certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of sales for all periods presented 
a detailed explanation of our results of operations follows this table 
year ended december  sales gross profit marketing sales expenses g a expenses operating income net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  increased to approximately  carats from  carats 
the average selling price per carat decreased by due to a product mix in which a greater percentage of smaller size jewels  which have a lower price per carat  were sold 
us sales accounted for approximately and of sales during the years ended december  and  respectively 
us net sales and carat shipments  excluding consigned jewels  increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased us shipments are due primarily to the fourth quarter jcpenney launch as well as the rollout into additional jcpenney stores on march  and the rollout to a portion of the jewelry departments leased by finlay enterprises 
as a result  our two largest customers  k g creations the supplier of finlay and reeves park the supplier of jcpenney  each accounted for of our sales during the year ended december  as compared to and  respectively  during our third largest customer  stuller  accounted for of our sales during as compared to during we expect that  at least in the short term  we will remain dependent on our ability and that of our manufacturing customers to maintain and enhance the jcpenney and finlay programs 
while we believe our current relationships with these customers and retailers are good  a loss of any of these customer or retailer relationships could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
international net sales and carat shipments increased by and  respectively for the year ended december  as compared to the increase resulted primarily from increased sales into taiwan  indonesia  and the united kingdom  partially offset by decreased sales into singapore and korea 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross profit margin percentage was primarily caused by lower production costs in the fifo period relieved from inventory  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per carat caused by a product mix in which a greater percentage of smaller size jewels  which have a lower price per carat  were sold 
future gross profit margins will fluctuate based upon the costs being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy and our average selling price per carat 
we expect that the costs being relieved from inventory in should trend lower than the costs relieved in  with variations quarter to quarter  as on average we have achieved declining production costs over the past few years 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses decreased to from in the primary reasons for the increase in expenses are  of increased co op advertising expense   of increased print advertising  and  of increased stock option compensation expense on options previously issued to sales consultants for new business development 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us  and is subject to the customer providing us documentation of all advertising copy that includes the company s products 
the increase in co op advertising is due to increased sales and the program being offered to a major customer in  who was not in the program in we intend to manage our marketing and sales expenses in to approximate the same percentage of sales as experienced in general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses decreased to from in the increase in expenses is primarily due 
table of contents to  of increased compensation costs and a  increase in professional and accounting services 
the increased compensation costs are primarily due to  of increased costs associated with our executive compensation plan 
the increased professional and accounting fees primarily relate to costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the costs incurred in relate to our efforts in developing alternate sources of raw material 
we expect research and development costs during to be less than the amount incurred in interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from a higher interest rate earned on our cash balances  as well as larger cash balances 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our statutory tax rate consists of the federal income tax rate of and north carolina income tax rate of  net of the federal benefit 
our effective income tax rate is higher than our statutory rate primarily due to our inability to currently recognize an income tax benefit for our operating losses in hong kong and china 
we cannot recognize this income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in these tax jurisdictions to offset the existing losses 
the decreased effective tax rate in compared to is primarily due to foreign operating losses being a smaller percentage of pre tax income 
our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by an increase in the research tax credits expected to be realized and our effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a reduction in state income tax expense caused by a change in the apportionment of taxable income among state jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels  excluding consigned jewels  also increased to approximately  carats from  carats in the average selling price per carat was the same in both years as we sold a comparable product mix 
domestic sales accounted for approximately and of sales during and  respectively 
domestic net sales and carat shipments increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased domestic shipments were due primarily to the launch of moissanite at jcpenney  as well as higher volume of sales to stuller following their first release of a twenty page moissanite jewelry catalog for retailers 
our three largest customers  k g creations  reeves park  and stuller  accounted for   and  respectively  of our sales during the year ended december  international net sales and carat shipments increased by and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from sales increases in singapore  dubai  and korea  resulting from increased promotions in these areas 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross margin percentage was primarily caused by lower cost inventory items being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased to from in the primary reasons for the increase are  of increased advertising expenses to promote customer sales opportunities at new and existing retailers 
this increase was partially offset by  of advertising production costs in  not incurred in  associated with the redesign of our advertising message 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
although there was an increase in these expenses  as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased to from in the increase in expenses is primarily due to  of increased professional fees and  of increased compensation costs 
the primary reason for the increase in compensation costs was  of accrued compensation cost in under our executive compensation plan 
there were no costs recorded in under the executive compensation plan as the company did not meet its internal sales and profit goals 
the net increase in general and administrative expenses was reduced by  in non recurring legal fees incurred in relating to settled litigation 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from a higher interest rate earned on our cash balances 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our statutory tax rate consists of the federal income tax rate of and north carolina income tax rate of  net of the federal benefit 
our effective income tax rate was higher than our statutory rate primarily due to our inability to currently recognize an income tax benefit for our operating losses in hong kong and china 
we cannot recognize this income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in these countries to offset the existing losses 
our effective income tax rate was lower in than primarily due to the benefit of certain research tax credits 
after a detailed review of the company s research activities  the amount of the research credits expected to be realized was increased in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash and inventory account for of our current assets 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
during the year ended december    of cash was provided by operations 
the primary reasons for the increase in cash provided by operating activities were pretax income of  and an increase in current liabilities of  partially offset by a  increase in trade receivables 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued co op advertising 
the increase in accrued co op advertising is due to our customers not yet receiving reimbursement from us for a portion of their advertising activities during due to delays in receiving the required documentation from our customers 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us  and is subject to the customer providing us documentation of all advertising copy that includes the company s products 
we have estimated the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers based on our history with each customer 
when the appropriate materials are submitted to us  we issue a credit memo to the customer which will reduce our receivables 
the increase in trade receivables is primarily due to higher sales 
there was  of cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  due to  of cash proceeds from the exercise of  stock options  partially offset by  in dividend payments 
income tax payments for the year ended december  were limited to  due to the utilization of a portion of the company s net operating loss nol carryforwards to offset the taxable income generated during that period by our us operations 
as of december   we had a us nol carryforward of approximately million and a north carolina nol carryforward of 
table of contents approximately million  which expire between and federal and state income tax payments will be limited in future periods to primarily alternative minimum tax payments until the nol carryforwards have been completely utilized 
periodically  the company sells jewels to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
the company does not recognize revenue on these transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that it will keep the jewels or the expiration of the memo period 
any jewels shipped to our customers on memo terms are classified as inventory on consignment on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the  of inventory on consignment at december  represents potential revenue of approximately  and potential gross profit of approximately  based on the average cost per carat of inventory at december  management considers its investment in inventory essential to be able to meet the orders of its expanding customer base and to fulfill requests from our customers for consigned inventory 
it is management s opinion that while total inventory should remain consistent with current levels  inventory turnover should increase due to forecasted sales increases  thereby not requiring a significant use of working capital 
on june   the company entered into an amended and restated exclusive supply agreement exclusive supply agreement with cree  inc cree 
the exclusive supply agreement had an initial term of ten years which in was extended for an additional ten years to july in connection with the exclusive supply agreement  the company has committed to purchase a minimum of by dollar volume of its requirements for sic crystals from cree 
if the company s orders require cree to expand beyond specified production levels  the company must commit to purchase certain minimum quantities 
in february  we agreed with cree on a framework for purchases for the company is obligated to purchase a minimum quantity of usable material on a quarterly basis if cree meets certain minimum quality levels 
for each quarter during  the company has committed to purchase approximately  of raw material  assuming the quality of material is consistent with that received in in february  we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with norstel ab formerly jesperator ab for the supply of sic for use in the manufacturing of moissanite jewels 
the initial term of the contract is for three years  and includes minimum purchase commitments of usable material of approximately million  of which approximately  will be expensed as research and development when the material is received 
in addition  the company advanced  to norstel ab in february towards the purchase of certain equipment 
this advance is scheduled to be repaid starting july through a reduction on invoices for subsequent purchases of sic  over the initial term of the agreement 
the minimum purchase commitment during is relatively small at approximately  of which approximately  will be expensed as research and development 
in november  we entered into and exclusive supply agreement with intrinsic semiconductor  inc for the supply of sic for use in the manufacturing of moissanite jewels 
the initial term of the contract is for two years  and includes minimum purchase commitments of usable material of approximately million  subject to intrinsic semiconductor  inc meeting minimum quality standards 
in may  we entered into an eighth amendment to our agreement with john m 
bachman  inc jmb  the supplier of the majority of the faceting services used by the company 
pursuant to the terms of the amendment  the company provided jmb with a cash advance of  which was used by jmb to expand its affiliate s production facility and procure additional equipment and labor as needed to enable jmb and its affiliate to satisfy the requested increase in production volumes 
the cash advance is being repaid to the company through reduced charges for faceting services provided to the company 
as of december   the balance due to us on this advance is  we expect the advance to be completely repaid by the end of 
table of contents on may   the company declared a per share cash dividend and a stock dividend both distributed on july  pursuant to these dividends  total cash of  and  shares of our common stock were distributed to shareholders on july  the stock dividend provided shareholders one share for every shares owned and cash in lieu of fractional shares 
on december   the company declared a one share for every four shares owned stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on january  the stock split provided shareholders cash in lieu of fractional shares 
pursuant to this dividend   shares of our common stock and  were distributed to shareholders on january  all share and per share amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock dividends 
the company expects to review the dividend policy on an annual basis and payment of future dividends will be dependent on the facts and circumstances at the time of that review 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and other working capital  management believes that our existing capital resources are adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations consist of our purchase commitments with cree  norstel ab  and intrinsic semiconductor  the operating lease on our manufacturing and administrative facility in morrisville  nc and the operating leases for our companies in hong kong and china 
below are the amounts of these commitments in tabular form 
payments due by period contractual obligations total beyond purchase commitments cree operating leases purchase commitments norstel purchase commitments intrinsic total during  we are committed to purchase approximately  of raw material each quarter assuming the quality of material is consistent with that received in these amounts are the minimum purchase amounts 
if norstel ab has capacity to manufacture additional sic  our total commitment could reach million contingent on norstel ab meeting our quality standards 
our remaining purchase commitment to intrinsic semiconductor is through october  there is not a minimum purchase commitment amount in a given year 
this chart assumes the total commitment is spread evenly over the remaining term of the supply agreement 
under our exclusive supply agreement with cree  we are obligated to buy from cree  and cree is obligated to sell to us  at least  by dollar volume  of our requirements for sic material for the production of gemstones in each calendar quarter 
net operating loss carryforward at december   the company has a us nol tax carryforward of approximately million and a north carolina tax nol carryforward of approximately million  expiring through for federal income tax and for state income tax purposes  which can be offset against future federal and state taxable income 
in accordance with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a change in equity ownership of greater than of the company within a three year period results in an annual limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nol carryforwards that were created during tax periods prior to the change in ownership 
as a result of various equity offerings and certain shareholder transactions  the utilization of a portion of the company s nol carryforwards has become limited  however  the company does not believe this limitation will have a material effect on the company s ability to utilize the nol carryforward 

table of contents as of december   there was approximately million in nol carryforwards in hong kong 
in accordance with the hong kong tax code these amounts can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in hong kong 
due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in hong kong to utilize this nol  we have established a valuation allowance against this deferred income tax asset 
as of december   there was approximately  in nol carryforwards in china 
in accordance with the china tax code these amounts can be carried forward years to offset future taxable income in china 
the nol carryforwards begin expiring in due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient future taxable income in china to utilize this nol  we have established a valuation allowance against this deferred income tax asset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to costing of inventories  revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  and co op advertising 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our inventories consist primarily of colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
moissanite jewels that do not meet our grading criteria and therefore are not deemed to be saleable are not included in inventories 
we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
as a result  our inventories do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
our distribution channels include two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  jewelry manufacturers  traditional retail stores  home shopping channels and catalogs 
consequently  significant amounts of inventories must be maintained at all times 
during  we established a lower of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain shapes and sizes of jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
the reserve is necessary to allow for the carat weight loss during the re cutting process 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
since the establishment of this reserve  we have not yet re cut any jewels 
at december   the reserve remained at  revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped 
our standard payment terms for jewel distributors are generally between and days and for jewelry manufacturers are generally between to days 
some customers are required to prepay prior to shipment 
for all jewels shipped title passes upon shipment of the jewels from our facility ie  fob shipping point 
periodically  the company sells product to customers on memo terms 
for shipments on memo terms  the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period 
our customers are generally required to make payments on memo shipments within days upon the customer informing the company that it will keep the product 
accordingly  the company does not recognize revenue on these memo transactions until the earlier of the customer informing the company that it will keep the product or the expiration of the right of return period 
all memo shipments are shown on our balance sheets as inventory on consignment 
estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
first  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the 
table of contents receivable that we deem collectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the second reserve against accounts receivable is the allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve in is primarily due to the lower return rate experienced in than we offer a co op advertising program to many of our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
these amounts were  and  at december  and  respectively 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer  and the related contractual arrangements to provide certain levels of co op advertising for our customers 
the amount increased in due to higher sales and because the coop advertising program was offered to a major customer in  who was not in the program in newly issued accounting pronouncements in december  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r  share based payments  was issued  as a revision to fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under fas statement r must be adopted no later than the first annual period beginning after june  the company adopted statement r on january  as permitted by fas  the company accounted for share based payments to employees during the three years ended december   using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and other factors 
however  had the company adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the stock compensation section of note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective december   the company accelerated the vesting of certain outstanding stock options held by current employees and non employee directors in order to reduce the impact of new accounting regulations that became effective in as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately  shares of company common stock that would otherwise have vested at various times within the next three years became fully vested 
the decision to accelerate these unvested options  which management believes is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders  was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would be recorded in future periods subsequent to december  the company recorded approximately  of expense in the year ended december  as the result of the accelerated vesting 
the acceleration of the vesting of these stock options will reduce future compensation expense by approximately  of which  would have occurred in 
table of contents in november  fas no 
 inventory costs  was issued 
this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  fas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have an effect on its consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant because our investments are limited to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less 
at december   the majority of our cash was in short term investments classified as cash and equivalents 
all of our transactions with international customers and suppliers are denominated in us dollars
