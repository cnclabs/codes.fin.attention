we operate in four business segments 
the first three  machinery technologies north america  machinery technologies europe and mold technologies  serve the plastics processing industries 
our fourth segment  industrial fluids  serves the metalworking sector 
both of our machinery technologies segments provide leading edge capital equipment  related tooling and replacement parts for the three most common methods of processing plastics injection molding  blow molding and extrusion 
our mold technologies segment supplies mold bases  mold components  hot runner systems and numerous other components for injection molding  as well as mro maintenance  repair and operating supplies for all plastics processing operations 
our industrial fluids segment develops and sells premium fluids for metalworking applications such as machining  grinding  forming and process cleaning 
in all our businesses  we focus on leading edge technology with superior aftermarket service and support 
we entered the plastics machinery business with the introduction of our first line of injection molding machines in the late s 
by the mid s  we had become the number one us producer of plastics machinery 
our major customers are producers of automobiles  packaging  building materials  consumer goods  electrical products  appliances and housewares  industrial components and machinery  and medical devices 
milacron pioneered the development and introduction of synthetic water based industrial fluids in the late s 
our largest customer for fluids is the automotive industry  followed by makers of industrial components and machinery  aircraft  appliances and housewares  and energy extraction 

table of contents plastics markets background and recent history since the end of world war ii  plastics and plastic composites have increasingly replaced traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper throughout manufacturing 
since  global consumption of plastics resins has grown at a compounded annual rate of  compared to for steel and for aluminum sources basf ag  association of plastics manufacturers in europe  international iron steel institute  us geological survey 
plastic part production  like industrial production in general  has historically shown sustained growth 
in every year from to  plastic part production in the us increased over the prior year  averaging compounded annual growth source us federal reserve board 
growth in plastics consumption and production has generally created increasing demand for our plastics machinery and related supplies 
between and  our sales of plastics equipment and supplies in north america grew at compounded annually excluding acquisitions including acquisitions 
in the s  milacron  like many other us companies  benefited from a strong  growing economy 
our plastics technologies sales were approaching billion with good profitability 
at the end of the decade  however  the us manufacturing sector fell into its most severe and prolonged downturn since the s 
from june to june  for example  us industrial production  a key indicator of demand for our products  declined source us federal reserve board 
the plastics processing portion of the manufacturing sector was very severely impacted 
as production slowed  capacity utilization rates of us plastics processors dropped from the previous peaks in excess of to record lows around source us federal reserve board  and shipments of injection molding machines in north america fell from a billion month moving total in to under million by the end of it stayed at very low levels through  experiencing only a partial recovery in source the society of plastics industry 
during this deep recession in north america  with european markets stagnant  demand for many of our plastics machinery lines declined by or more  and our total global plastics technologies sales fell 
despite a series of responsive actions  including a number of plant closings  head count reductions and other measures resulting in cumulative annual cost savings of million  severely depressed sales volumes led to consolidated losses from continuing operations in through in early  the manufacturing sector of the north american economy began to show some signs of recovery 
in the plastics sector  part production and us capacity utilization were increasing gradually 
in mid  however  the industry was hit by a steep  unexpected jump in oil prices  resulting in rapid rises in material and resin costs 
many of our plastics processing customers were negatively impacted  and we saw a slower recovery in plastics machinery orders in the second half of the year 
by the end of  energy and material costs appeared to have stabilized and there were signs that the recovery had resumed 
industrial fluids recent history during the severe manufacturing recession of  overall demand for our metalworking fluids declined by  as our largest customer group  automakers  maintained high levels of production both in north america and worldwide 
profitability in the fluids business  although impacted  held up fairly well throughout this period  with operating earnings in the range of to of sales 
in and  sales of our metalworking fluids grew modestly  but profitability in this segment declined due to significant increases in product liability insurance and related expenses  as well as higher material costs and pension expense 
consolidated results sales and new orders in were up slightly compared to  as good growth in north america and asia and favorable currency translation effects were tempered by weakness in western europe 
our net loss for the year was million  and included million in after tax restructuring charges 
this compared to a net loss of million  which included  with no tax benefit  million of refinancing costs and million of restructuring costs 
savings from restructuring and other cost reduction measures were offset by increased costs for materials  pension  insurance and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents opportunities and challenges during the first half of  the recovery in machinery orders in north america was strong  growing at over the prior year 
in mid year  however  oil and related energy costs rose suddenly and unexpectedly  which had the effect of slowing the order rate improvement to about in the second half 
also during the year  we faced increased pension and insurance expense  higher costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and ongoing weakness in western european markets 
as we enter  it appears that energy and material prices have stabilized and capacity utilization rates by us plastics processors are rising again to historically high levels 
this bodes well for continued recovery in our north american machinery businesses  and we are projecting an overall global sales growth of to for the year 
profitability  however  remains under pressure from high material  pension and insurance expenses 
in  we will continue to develop new and better products and services  especially in the aftermarket sectors of our businesses 
we will also strengthen our performance and customer focus in our home markets of north america and western europe  while expanding our presence outside the united states  canada and western europe 
critical to our long term success  during the year we will be executing the restructuring of our european plastics businesses  however the bulk of the benefits will not be realized until overall  with further sales growth and improved pricing  as well as some cost reductions  we have the opportunity to improve operating performance in each of our segments as the year progresses 
consolidated results presence outside the us since  milacron has significantly expanded its presence outside the us and become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was stronger in relation to the us dollar than in despite the progressive weakening that occurred during the year 
as a result  milacron experienced favorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the effect on earnings was not material 
during  the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately which caused the majority of a million unfavorable adjustment to consolidated shareholders equity 
if the euro should weaken further against the dollar in future periods  we could experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that we believe are significant to our reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note captioned summary of significant accounting policies on pages through of this form k  which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
we regularly review our estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while we believe that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had significant deferred tax assets related to us and non us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and related to charges that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax purposes 
these charges include the write down of goodwill and a 
table of contents charge to equity related to minimum pension funding 
at december   we have provided valuation allowances against all net deferred tax assets except million in the us that are offset by million of qualified tax planning strategies and million of available carrybacks and million of non us assets to be realized through future income expectations and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized in the future 
the establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because expectations as to the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards are generally contingent on the generation of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies 
tax planning strategies represent prudent and feasible actions that management would take to create taxable income to keep a tax attribute from expiring during the carryforward period 
determinations of the amounts related to tax planning strategies assume hypothetical transactions  some of which involve the disposal of substantial business assets  and certain variables which are judgmental and subjective 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider our short term and long range internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic conditions in the markets and countries in which we operate  and the effect of potential economic changes on our various operations 
at december   we had non us net operating loss carryforwards principally in the netherlands  germany and italy totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million had been provided with respect to these assets 
we believe that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in these jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  there is currently insufficient positive evidence in some non us jurisdictions primarily germany and italy to conclude that no valuation allowances are required 
at december   we had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of million  which will expire between and deferred tax assets related to this loss carryforward  as well as to federal tax credit carryforward million and additional state and local loss carryforwards million  totaled million 
additional deferred tax assets totaling approximately million had also been provided for book deductions not currently deductible for tax purposes  including the writedown of goodwill  postretirement health care benefit costs and accrued pension liabilities 
the deductions for financial reporting purposes are expected to be deducted for income tax purposes in future periods  at which time they will have the effect of decreasing taxable income or increasing the net operating loss carryforward 
the latter will have the effect of extending the ultimate expiration of the net operating loss carryforward beyond due to a change in ohio income franchise tax law signed by the governor on june   the corporate income franchise tax will be phased out ratably over the years through as a result of the legislative change  the benefit of our ohio net operating loss carryforward will also be phased out 
the transaction entered into with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc on june  see liquidity and sources of capital caused an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue code and regulations and will substantially delay the timing of the utilization of certain of the pre change us loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
the company has calculated an annual limitation of approximately million that can be used to offset post change taxable income 
this limitation is for each year and is cumulative for years in which the limitation is not fully utilized 
therefore  the cumulative limitation at the end of amounts to approximately million which consisted of million from and million from this delay will increase tax expense and decrease available cash in future years 
at june   we concluded that a recovery in the plastics industry and our return to profitability in the us would be delayed longer than originally expected 
as a result of these delays and the incremental costs of the restructuring initiatives announced in the third quarter of  we expected to incur a cumulative operating loss in the us for the three year period ending december  in such situations  us generally accepted accounting principles include a presumption that expectations of earnings in the future cannot be considered in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
accordingly  a charge to the tax provision of approximately million was recorded in the second quarter of to establish valuation allowances with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets for which future income was previously assumed 

table of contents during the second half of and during the year  we increased us deferred tax assets by a total of million 
valuation allowances were increased by million during this period 
as of december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 
we continued to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies to conclude that valuation allowances were not required with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
at december   valuation allowances had not been recorded with respect to million of us deferred tax assets based on qualified tax planning strategies of million and tax carrybacks of million 
due to better market information and refined estimates  the million of tax planning strategies at the end of represented a net million increase over the tax planning strategies at december  which resulted in a million non cash credit to the provision for income taxes in for the year  us deferred tax assets increased by million 
valuation allowances were increased by million during this period 
at december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 
we continue to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies to conclude that valuation allowances are not required with respect to a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
at december   valuation allowances had not been recorded with respect to million of us deferred tax assets based on qualified tax planning strategies 
due to continuous monitoring of the factors used to determine the value of our tax planning strategies  the million of tax planning strategies at december  represented a net million decrease from the value of tax planning strategies at december  we will continue to reassess our conclusions regarding qualified tax planning strategies and their effect on the amount of valuation allowances that are required on a quarterly basis 
this could result in a further increase in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in shareholders equity in the period of the change 
accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves our internal accounting policies require that each of our operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables  inventory obsolescence and warranty costs in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of our customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but in all cases must conform to company guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivable amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
because of the product line and customer diversity noted above  each business unit is required to base the percentages it applies to its aged receivables on its unique history of collection problems 
the percentages used are reviewed for continued reasonableness on a quarterly basis 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable for our continuing operations have averaged million during the last three years 
while we believe that our reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of our major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
as is the case for allowances for doubtful accounts  each business unit selects the percentages it applies based on its i unique history of inventory usage and obsolescence problems and ii forecasted usage 
the preliminary calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  our operations recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
we believe that our reserves are appropriate in light of our historical results and our assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
our warranty reserves are of two types normal and extraordinary 
normal warranty reserves are intended to cover routine costs associated with the repair or replacement of products sold in the ordinary course of 
table of contents business during the warranty period 
these reserves are accrued using a percentage of sales approach based on the ratio of actual warranty costs over a representative number of years to sales revenues from products sold with warranties over the same period 
the percentages are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary at least annually 
extraordinary warranty reserves are intended to cover major problems related to a single machine or customer order or to problems related to a large number of machines or other type of product 
these reserves are intended to cover the estimated costs of resolving the problems based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
in recent years  costs related to extraordinary warranty problems have not been significant 
in  our operations accrued warranty reserves totaling million and incurred warranty related costs totaling million 
while we believe that our warranty reserves are adequate in the circumstances  unforeseen problems related to unexpired warranty obligations could result in a requirement for additional reserves in the future 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in years prior to  we reviewed the carrying value of goodwill annually using estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 under which we test goodwill for impairment using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
the change from undiscounted to discounted cash flows resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax that was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method as of january  sfas no 
requires that the first phase of testing goodwill for impairment be based on a business unit s fair value  which is generally best determined through market prices 
due to the absence of market prices for our businesses and as permitted by sfas no 
 we have elected to base our testing on discounted cash flows as discussed above 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we complete in the third quarter of each year 
in this process  each business unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
each business unit s plan is reviewed by corporate management and the entire plan is reviewed with our board of directors 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels  general economic trends and other factors 
the discount rates are obtained from an outside source based on the standard industrial classification codes in which our businesses operate 
these discount rates are then judgmentally adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results  country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the non us countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate and other factors 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industries in which we operate 
in recent years  many of our cash flow forecasts have not been achieved due in large part to the unprecedented length and depth of the recession  particularly in the market for capital equipment in the plastics processing industry 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable in the circumstances  various economic factors could cause the results of our testing to vary significantly 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever certain indicators of impairment are determined to be present 
in the third quarter of  we tested the goodwill of the mold base and components and maintenance  repair and operating supplies mro businesses that are included in the mold technologies segment for impairment due to the presence of certain indicators of impairment 
although these businesses failed to achieve the cash flow forecasts included in their annual business plans during the first half of the year  at the end of the second quarter of it was believed that a further economic recovery in both north america and europe would result in improved cash flows for these businesses for the remainder of the year and for subsequent years 
it was also anticipated that the restructuring actions undertaken in europe in the years through would significantly improve the overall cash flow of the mold base and components business 
during the third quarter of  we completed our annual long range planning process that focused on the years 
table of contents through this process revealed that the future cash flows expected to be generated by the two businesses would continue to be lower than the amounts anticipated a year earlier 
the biggest decrease in expected cash flow related to the european mold base and components business due to the anticipation of continued softness in the markets it serves 
because of the change in expectations  we tested the goodwill of both businesses for impairment during the third quarter of rather than waiting for the annual review that is conducted during the fourth quarter 
this review resulted in a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million that was recorded in the third quarter and subsequently adjusted to million in the fourth quarter after the completion of the independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets that were required to determine their fair values 
our annual reviews of goodwill impairment as of october  and did not result in additional impairment charges 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets other than goodwill annually under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these reviews are conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in our long range internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
to be conservative  no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  we reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of our long lived assets 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in self insurance reserves through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  we are primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and worker s compensation for certain us employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to us 
exposure for general and product liability claims is supplemented by reinsurance coverage in some cases and by excess liability coverage in all policy years 
worker s compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal and the company had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all coverages totaling approximately million and expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties of million 
expected recoveries represent the excess of total reserves for known exposures and incurred but not reported claims over the limits on the policies mal issues to us 
of the million in reserves at december   million is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
the remaining million is included in accrued and other current liabilities 
the expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties are included in other current assets million and other noncurrent assets million 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims  including those arising from litigation  and our best estimates of the ultimate liabilities thereunder after consideration of excess carriers liabilities and claims against third parties and on estimates of the cost of incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted at least quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates or as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that the recorded reserves are appropriate based on current information 
it is possible that our ultimate liability could substantially exceed our recorded reserves as of december   but the amount of any such excess cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
were we to have significant adverse judgments or determine  as cases progress  that significant additional reserves should be recorded  our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

table of contents pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for certain us employees and retirees  which is also the only defined benefit plan that is funded 
excluding charges of million for temporary supplemental retirement benefits that were offered in connection with restructuring actions  we recorded pension income of million related to this plan in in  however  pension income decreased to 
million  once again excluding charges for supplemental benefits of million 
we recorded pension expense related to this plan of approximately million in and million in pension expense for is currently expected to be approximately million to million 
expense for and beyond is dependent on a number of factors  including returns on plan assets  changes in the plan s discount rate and potential legislative changes  and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension income or expense and the reasons for the changes identified above 
a significant factor in determining the amount of income or expense to be recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
in and in several preceding years  we used an expected long term rate of return of 
however  we began using a rate of return of beginning in and continued to do so in and the expected rate will be further reduced to beginning in we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in evaluating future returns on equity securities  the existing portfolio is stratified to separately consider large and small capitalization investments  as well as international securities 
the change from the rate of return assumption to the lower rate had the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense that would otherwise be reportable in by more than million 
in determining the amount of pension income or expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension income or expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on the long term rate of return assumption 
at december   the market value of the plan s assets was million whereas the calculated value of these assets was million 
the difference arises principally because only one third of the loss incurred in in relation to the expected rate of return is included in the latter amount 
if significant asset related losses are incurred in  it will have the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense to be recognized in future years beginning in in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension income or expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at december   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was reduced from to 
the rate was further lowered to at december   at december  and at december  the combined effects of these changes and the variances in relation to the long term rate of return assumption discussed above have resulted in cumulative losses in excess of the corridor 
pension expense for includes almost million for the amortization of previously unrecognized losses 
expense for amortization of previously unrecognized losses is expected to be between and million in additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent increase in the rate of return on plan assets assumption would have the effect of decreasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable decrease in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one quarter 
table of contents percent increase in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately million 
conversely  a one quarter percent decrease in the discount rate would have the effect of increasing pension expense by million 
because of the significant decrease in the value of the assets of the funded plan for us employees and retirees during and and the decreases in the plan s discount rate  we recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of million effective december  and significantly reduced the carrying value of the pension asset related to the plan 
this resulted in a million after tax reduction in shareholders equity 
at december   the reduction in shareholders equity was decreased by million with no tax effect due to an increase in plan assets in that was partially offset by an increase in liabilities that resulted from a lower discount rate 
during  the amount of the adjustment to shareholder s equity was increased by million with no related tax effect to million 
the change was due to an increase in the assets of the funded plan that was more than offset by an increase in its liabilities due to the change in the discount rate and to the recording of a similar adjustment related to an unfunded plan 
during  the adjustment was further increased by million with no tax effect due principally to a million decrease in plan assets 
all of these adjustments were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and therefore did not affect our net losses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
however  they resulted in after tax reductions of shareholders equity at december  and december  of million and million  respectively 
results of operations in an effort to help readers better understand the composition of our operating results  certain of the discussions that follow include references to restructuring costs 
accordingly  those discussions should be read in connection with i the tables on pages and of this form k under the caption comparative operating results and ii the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included herein on pages through basis of presentation as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned summary of significant accounting policies change in method of accounting  in the fourth quarter of  we elected to change our method of accounting for certain us plastics machinery inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
certain of the amounts discussed herein for the year have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation 
earnings per common share as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned earnings per common share  the numbers of shares used to compute earnings loss per common share data for all years prior to were increased by a factor of to include the effect of a bonus element inherent in a rights offering that was completed in the fourth quarter of discontinued operations as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned discontinued operations  in the third quarter of we began to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of our round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses 
the round metalcutting tools business was sold in two separate transactions in the third quarter of and the grinding wheels business was sold in the second quarter of both of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
the comparisons of results of operations that follow exclude these businesses and relate solely to our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
pension expense and pension funding in and prior years  we recorded significant amounts of income related to our defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees and retirees 
however  because of the significant decrease in the value of the plan s assets and changes in the rate of return on assets and discount rate assumptions see significant accounting policies and judgments pensions  pension income in was reduced to 
million  of which 
million is included in 
table of contents continuing operations 
for  we recorded pension expense of million  substantially all of which was charged to continuing operations 
pension expense increased to million in the entire amount is included in continuing operations 
as discussed further below  the fluctuations between years have negatively affected margins  selling and administrative expense and earnings 
additional increases in non cash pension expense are expected in because of the funded status of the plan  we will be required to make cash contributions to the plan s trust for the next several years in addition to the million that was contributed in a discussion of the amounts that may be required in future years is included in footnote b to the table in the section of this form k titled contractual obligations 
compared to new orders and sales consolidated new orders were million in  an increase of million  or  in relation to new orders of million in consolidated sales were million in  an increase of million  or  in relation to a large majority of both increases related to the north american injection molding machine business 
new orders and sales benefited from million and million  respectively  of favorable foreign currency effects 
export orders were million in compared to million in reduced export orders for us built injection molding machines more than accounted for the decrease as order levels for all other plastics product lines increased 
export sales decreased modestly from million in to million in export sales of injection molding machines decreased while volume for all other product lines was relatively flat with the exception of mold bases and components which experienced a increase 
the reduction in export business for injection molding machines was due principally to the recent formation of a joint venture to manufacture these products in china 
sales of all segments to non us markets were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in products manufactured outside of the us represented of total sales in and of sales in the backlog of unfilled orders was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase relates principally to higher order levels for injection molding machines and blow molding systems 
margins  costs and expenses the consolidated manufacturing margin was in including million of restructuring costs related to product line discontinuation  the manufacturing margin was 
excluding these costs  the margin was 
in  margins were negatively affected by rising raw material costs 
while we implemented selective price increases over the course of the year  these actions were not always sufficient to overcome the cost increases we experienced 
however  we expect that further cost reduction measures combined with additional selective price increases will result in improved margins in in addition to material cost increases  pension expense related to cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in however  margins benefited from more than million of incremental cost savings from the restructuring actions that were initiated in and we expect to realize additional savings related to certain of these actions in as discussed further below  we plan to implement additional actions in that are expected to result in annualized savings of up to million 
a majority of these savings will benefit cost of products sold and manufacturing margins 
total selling and administrative expense increased from million in to million in selling expense was virtually flat in relation to but decreased from of sales to of sales in pension cost included in selling expense was million in compared to million in administrative expense increased by million due principally to a million increase in costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
for  sox costs are expected to decrease by more than million from the million of expense recorded in 
table of contents other expense net decreased from million in to

no refinancing costs were incurred in restructuring costs the paragraphs that follow discuss certain of the restructuring actions that have been initiated in recent years 
these actions are discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned restructuring costs which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
in  we announced plans to relocate the manufacture of container blow molding and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our more modern and efficient facility near cincinnati  ohio 
the relocation was substantially completed in and the mold making operation was relocated to a smaller location near manchester 
in  we also announced that the manufacture of special mold bases at the monterey park  california facility would be phased out and transferred to other locations in north america 
early in  we initiated a plan for the further restructuring of our european blow molding machinery operations and the discontinuation of certain product lines 
in  we also initiated the closure of the special mold base machining plant at mahlberg  germany and the relocation of a portion of its manufacturing to another location 
certain other production was outsourced 
in the second half of  we announced additional restructuring initiatives that focused on further overhead cost reductions in each of our plastics technologies segments and at the corporate office 
these actions involved the relocation of production and warehousing  closures of sales offices  voluntary early retirement programs and general overhead reductions in both north america and europe 
in  we initiated actions to further enhance customer service while reducing the overhead cost structure of the machinery technologies north america segment 
we also elected to discontinue the sale of certain lines of blow molding systems in north america 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a plan to reduce employment levels at a mold technologies facility in germany due to sluggish demand 
we also initiated additional headcount reductions in our european mold base and components business that represented a continuation of the actions that had been implemented beginning in in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we plan to further reduce our cost structure by consolidating certain operations in north america and europe 
one of these actions the consolidation of sales offices in 
table of contents europe began in and will continue in in  we also initiated the closure of a small metalworking fluids blending plant in germany 
in total  the actions described above as well as costs to integrate two subsidiaries acquired in resulted in restructuring costs of million in and million in net cash costs for all restructuring actions were 
million in and million in the amount for is net of million of proceeds from the sale of two previously idled manufacturing facilities in germany and a surplus warehouse in denmark 
as discussed more fully below  additional restructuring actions will be initiated in the costs and related cash effects of the actions described above as well as certain other actions that were initiated in and are summarized in the table that follows

implementation of the consolidation actions  including the actions initiated in  is expected to result in restructuring charges in of at least million and cash costs of approximately million 
the annualized cost savings generated by the consolidations are expected to be approximately million  of which approximately million will be realized in substantially  all of the million benefit is expected to be realized in results by segment machinery technologies north america the machinery technologies north america segment had new orders of million and sales of million 
in  the segment s new orders were million while sales totaled million 
a large majority of the sales increase related to the segment s injection molding machine business but sales of blow molding systems also increased in relation to due in part to increased sales volume  the segment s operating profit excluding restructuring costs increased from million in to million in however  the segment s results were penalized by significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials and by a million increase in pension expense 
in addition  sox costs increased from 
million to million 
in  the segment s restructuring costs were million and related to actions announced in to enhance customer service and further reduce overhead costs and to the completion of the relocation of the manufacturing of molds for blow molding 
the segment s restructuring costs in were million which includes a portion of the cost of the initiatives  costs for the mold making relocation and a non cash adjustment of the carrying value of the former blow molding systems and mold manufacturing facility to reflect a revised estimate of its ultimate selling price 
the segment realized over million of incremental savings arising from the recent restructuring actions in machinery technologies europe in  the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million compared to orders of million in however  the segment s sales decreased from million to million due to lower shipments of both injection molding machines and blow molding systems 
foreign currency translation effects did not significantly affect the comparisons between years 
due to sluggish demand  higher materials costs and the inability to fully recover these cost increases  the segment had an operating loss excluding restructuring costs of million in compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
expense related to sox compliance increased from 
million in to million in the segment s restructuring costs were 
million and related to the first phase of the previously discussed consolidation of sales offices in europe 
in  restructuring costs were 
million 
mold technologies the mold technologies segment s new orders were million in and million in the increase was due principally to improved order levels in north america 
due to higher shipment levels in north america  sales increased from million to million 
both new orders and sales benefited modestly from foreign currency translation effects 
despite higher sales volume  the segment s operating profit excluding restructuring effects decreased from million in to million in higher raw materials costs  sluggish business conditions in europe and a million increase in sox expense adversely affected the segment s profitability in relation to the prior year 
in  the segment had restructuring expense of million related principally to adjustments to the carrying values of two previously closed facilities in germany 
table of contents to reflect revised estimates of their future selling prices and to costs to downsize another facility in germany 
additional overhead reductions in europe were also initiated in the fourth quarter of in  both of the closed facilities were sold which resulted in income from restructuring of 
million 
the restructuring actions initiated in recent years resulted in incremental cost savings in of approximately 
million in relation to industrial fluids the industrial fluids segment had new orders and sales of million each in in the prior year  new orders and sales were both million 
orders and sales increased in both north america and europe  the latter being due principally to favorable currency effects 
orders and sales also increased in asia 
due to higher energy  transportation and material costs especially for chemicals and steel the segment s operating profit before restructuring costs decreased from million in to million in profitability was also adversely affected by a 
million increase in pension expense and 
million of incremental costs for sox compliance 
however  insurance costs for product liability decreased by million due to favorable settlements of product liability claims in the fourth quarter 
in  the segment had restructuring costs of 
million related to the closure of a small fluids blending facility in mississippi and a blending facility in germany 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes in  our pretax loss from continuing operations was million compared to a loss of million in the amount for includes million of restructuring costs  million for sox compliance and million of expense related to the principal defined benefit pension plan for us employees and retirees 
the amount includes million of restructuring costs and million of refinancing costs 
costs for sox compliance were million in while pension expense for the principal us plan totaled million  including million that relates to continuing operations 
income taxes in  the company recorded a net us tax expense of 
million comprised of benefits related to a special ten year carryback of million  additional valuation allowances of million related to a decrease in the value of tax planning strategies and state income taxes of 
million 
except for the benefits related to special carrybacks and due to the lack of sufficient positive evidence  the company was precluded from recognizing tax benefits related to the remaining operating loss incurred 
the company s non us operations recorded a net tax benefit of million for the year a benefit of million resulted from a waiver of intercompany notes receivable by our dutch subsidiary 
the benefit was partially offset by additional tax expense of 
million in the netherlands relating to a tax rate reduction applicable to our net operating loss carryforward 
the benefits were also reduced by income tax expense of million from profitable non us operations 
tax benefits relating to non profitable operations with a three year cumulative loss history were fully offset by valuation allowances 
in the aggregate  these factors resulted in a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million 
in  we recorded a net us tax benefit of million related primarily to a million increase in the value of our tax planning strategies and benefits relating to a special carryback provision of million 
however  we were precluded from recognizing tax benefits related to the remainder of our us operating loss and to losses in certain non us jurisdictions due to insufficient positive evidence regarding their probable realization 
profitable non us operations primarily in the netherlands  canada and india recorded income tax expense of million in additional valuation allowances totaling million were recorded against deferred tax assets in italy  france and denmark

compared to new orders and sales consolidated new orders were million in compared to million in consolidated sales totaled million in  which represents a million  or  increase over sales of million 
new orders and sales benefited from million and million  respectively  of favorable currency effects that resulted principally from the strength of the euro in relation to the us dollar 
export orders increased from million in to million in and export sales increased from million to million 
the increases were due principally to higher export business for us built injection molding machines that was offset to some degree by lower volume for blow molding systems 
total sales to non us markets  including exports  were million in compared to million in with the increase being due principally to currency effects

excluding restructuring costs  the manufacturing margin was 
including million of restructuring costs  the manufacturing margin was in excluding this amount  the margin was 
the improvement in the margin excluding restructuring costs was achieved despite higher raw material costs and a million increase in insurance expense 
pension expense also increased to million in compared to income of 
million in incremental cost savings from the restructuring actions that are discussed below were approximately million in approximately two thirds of savings in both years relate to cost of products sold 
while precise quantification is impossible  we believe that our results for also benefited from the process improvements initiated in recent years 
total selling and administrative expense decreased modestly from million in to million in despite adverse currency effects and a million increase in pension expense 
selling expense decreased by million due in part to the benefits of our restructuring actions 
lower bad debt expense and trade show costs 
table of contents also contributed to the decrease 
as a percent of sales  selling expense decreased from in to in administrative expense increased modestly due to currency effects and million of costs associated with implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act of these increases more than offset the benefits of our cost cutting initiatives 
other expense net was expense of million in compared to income of 
million in the latter amount includes million of income from the settlement of warranty claims against a supplier and 
million of income from the licensing of patented technology 
income from technology licensing was 
million in interest expense net of interest income increased from million in to million in due to higher borrowing costs including amortization of deferred financing fees related to the new financing arrangements entered into on march  and june  see liquidity and sources of capital 
the amount for also includes a one time  non cash charge of million for the write off of a financial asset related to the series a notes that were issued on march  the asset resulted from a beneficial conversion feature that allowed the holders of series a notes to acquire shares of common stock at approximately per share compared to a market value of per share on march  the interest rate swap that was entered into on july  see liquidity and sources of capital had the effect of lowering interest expense by 
million in refinancing costs during  we charged to expense million of refinancing costs  including million incurred in pursuing various alternatives to the march  refinancing of approximately million in debt and other obligations see liquidity and sources of capital

in the third and fourth quarters of  we expensed a total of million of costs incurred in that year in pursuing alternatives to the refinancing transactions 
restructuring costs the following paragraphs discuss the restructuring actions undertaken in recent years 
these actions are discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned restructuring costs which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
in november  we announced restructuring initiatives intended to improve operating efficiency and customer service 
one of these actions involved the transfer of all manufacturing of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our more modern and efficient facility near cincinnati  ohio 
in addition  the mold making operation has been moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near manchester 
in another action  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant was discontinued and transferred to other facilities in north america 
early in  we initiated a plan for the further restructuring of our european blow molding machinery operations  including the discontinuation of the manufacture of certain product lines at the magenta  italy plant 
we also initiated a plan to close our special mold base machining operation in mahlberg  germany and relocate a portion of its manufacturing to another location 
certain other production was outsourced 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement additional restructuring initiatives that focused on further overhead cost reductions in each of our plastics technologies segments and at the corporate office 
these actions involved the relocation of production  closure of sales offices  voluntary early retirement programs and general overhead reductions 
in the second quarter of  we initiated additional actions to further enhance customer service while reducing the total overhead cost structure of our north american plastics machinery operations 
in the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue the sale of certain lines of blow molding systems in north america 
this decision 
table of contents resulted in a charge of million to adjust the carrying values of the related inventory to net realizable value 
finally  in response to soft market conditions in western europe  we implemented further headcount reductions in our mold technologies business in that region during the fourth quarter 
in addition to the actions that are discussed above  restructuring costs in both and include costs to integrate the operations of two businesses acquired in with our existing mold base and components business in europe 
a majority of the costs relate to adjustments of the carrying values of two closed manufacturing facilities to reflect revised estimates of their ultimate selling prices 
in total  the actions described above resulted in restructuring costs of million in and million in the amount for includes non cash charges totaling million to adjust the carrying values of surplus machinery and three closed manufacturing facilities  including one located in the us  to expected realizable values 
cash costs related to the restructuring actions totaled million and million in and  respectively 
cash costs for certain other restructuring actions that were initiated in and were million in goodwill impairment charge in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million with no tax benefit to adjust the carrying value of the goodwill of two businesses included in the mold technologies segment 
the charge was calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows and resulted from a downward adjustment of the cash flows expected to be generated by these businesses due to the delay in the general economic recovery in both north america and europe 
the largest decrease in cash flow expectations related to our european mold base and components business due to continued weakness in the markets it serves 
results by segment machinery technologies north america new orders in the machinery technologies north america segment increased from million in to million in the segment s sales increased by million from million to million 
the increases were due principally to improved demand for injection molding machines  especially in the fourth quarter 
despite higher raw materials costs  the absence of million of income from the settlement of warranty claims against a supplier and a million increase in pension expense  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to earnings of million in  in both cases excluding restructuring costs which were million in and million in in  these costs related principally to actions intended to enhance customer service while further reducing overhead costs and to a non cash adjustment of the carrying value of our former blow molding systems facility to reflect revised estimates of its ultimate selling price 
the relocation of the blow molding machinery business and supplemental early retirement benefits intended to reduce the segment s cost structure accounted for a majority of the expense 
the segment s improved operating results in were due principally to increased sales volume  improved price realization and incremental benefits of approximately million related to the restructuring and cost cutting initiatives that were implemented in through machinery technologies europe the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million and sales of million in in  orders were million while sales totaled million 
currency effects contributed million of incremental orders and million of sales in demand was primarily export driven as orders in western europe slowed  particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
despite rising material costs  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to a loss of million in these amounts exclude restructuring costs of 
million in and million in in both years  these costs related to the restructuring of the segment s blow molding machinery business including the discontinuation of certain product lines that was undertaken in and to overhead reductions in the segment s injection molding machinery business 
the incremental savings related to these actions totaled approximately million in mold technologies the mold technologies segment s new orders of million were virtually unchanged from the prior year despite favorable currency effects of million 
the segment s sales of million were also flat despite million of favorable currency effects 
orders and sales improved modestly in north 
table of contents america but decreased in europe due to weak economic conditions in that region 
despite higher insurance costs in north america and raw material cost increases worldwide  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to a profit of million in  in both cases excluding restructuring costs 
the improvement in profitability was primarily the result of cost savings from recent restructuring actions in europe 
weak price realization and reduced sales volume in europe tempered the extent of the improvement 
the segment s restructuring costs totaled million in and million in the costs related principally to overhead reductions in north america and the further consolidation of the segment s european operations  including the closure of a manufacturing plant and the reorganization of its marketing and sales structure 
the amount for was due to adjustments to the carrying values of two closed facilities to reflect revised estimates of their future selling prices  costs to downsize another facility and additional overhead reductions implemented in the fourth quarter 
cost savings related to the and actions and to actions implemented in totaled approximately million 
industrial fluids the industrial fluids segment had new orders and sales of million each in compared to orders and sales of million in favorable currency effects accounted for a majority of the increases as manufacturing activity slowed in the second half of the year 
the segment s operating profit decreased from million in to million in due principally to higher insurance costs  which increased by million  and higher raw material costs  especially for chemicals and steel 
transportation costs also increased in the segment s pension expense increased by 
million as did selling expense to expand distribution networks in both north america and eastern europe 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes our pretax loss from continuing operations was million in compared to a loss of million in the amount for includes refinancing costs of million and restructuring costs of million 
the loss for includes the previously discussed million goodwill impairment charge as well as restructuring and refinancing costs of million and million  respectively 
the comparison between years benefited from incremental savings of million arising from the restructuring actions initiated in through but was adversely affected by a million increase in pension expense as well as higher insurance and raw material costs 
income taxes in the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge in the provision for income taxes to establish valuation allowances against a portion of our us deferred tax assets see significant accounting policies and judgments deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
additional deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were recorded in the second half of and in in  we recorded a net us tax benefit of million primarily related to a million increase in the value of our tax planning strategies and benefits relating to a special ten year carryback of million 
however  due to insufficient positive evidence we were precluded from recognizing a tax benefit related to the remaining operating loss incurred for the year 
certain of our non us subsidiaries also lacked sufficient positive evidence to allow them to record any tax benefits with respect to their losses for the year 
however  profitable non us operations  primarily in the netherlands  canada and india  recorded net income tax expense of million in additional valuation allowances of million were recorded against deferred tax asset balances in italy  france and denmark 
in the aggregate  these factors resulted in a tax benefit of million on a pretax loss from continuing operations of million 
in  the provision for income taxes of million includes the previously discussed million second quarter charge as well as tax expense related to profitable non us operations 
the same factors that precluded the recognition of tax benefits with respect to us and certain non us losses were also applicable in loss from continuing operations our loss from continuing operations was million  or per share  compared to a loss of million  or per share  in the loss for includes refinancing costs of million and restructuring costs of million  in both cases with no tax benefit 
in  the loss from continuing operations 
table of contents includes the million goodwill impairment charge with no tax benefit as well as million in after tax restructuring costs 
discontinued operations in and  the loss from discontinued operations includes the operating results of our grinding wheels business which was sold on april  in  discontinued operations also includes the results of our round metalcutting tools business that was sold in two separate transactions in september of that year 
in  discontinued operations includes a net gain of 
million to adjust the previously recorded loss on the divestiture of the grinding wheels business to reflect the actual sale proceeds and transaction costs and to further adjust losses on divestitures completed in prior years 
in  discontinued operations includes net expense of 
million to adjust previously recorded gains and losses on divestitures to reflect revised estimates of reserve requirements and expected divestiture proceeds 
net loss including the previously discussed refinancing and restructuring costs and the results of discontinued operations  our net loss in was million  or per share 
in  our net loss was million  or per share  which includes the million tax charge as well as restructuring costs and the goodwill impairment charge 
comparative operating results due to the significant effects of restructuring costs in recent years  the following tables are provided to assist the reader in better understanding our operating earnings loss including these amounts 
in millions machinery technologies north america operating results segment operating earnings as reported restructuring costs adjusted operating earnings in millions machinery technologies europe operating results segment operating earnings loss as reported restructuring costs adjusted operating earnings loss in millions mold technologies operating results segment operating earnings as reported restructuring costs adjusted operating earnings loss

we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
forward contracts totaled million at december  at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
the annual potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on our foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk at december   we had fixed rate debt of million  including million face value of senior secured notes due  and floating rate debt of million 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of million and floating rate debt of million 
through march   we also had the ability to sell accounts receivable under our accounts receivable purchase agreement which resulted in financing fees that fluctuated based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result of these factors  a portion of annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuate based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
however  before consideration of any adverse effect of the interest rate swap that is discussed in the following paragraph  the potential annual loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not be significant at either of the aforementioned dates 
on july   we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap that effectively converts a portion of fixed rate interest debt into a floating rate obligation 
the swap  which was amended in the first quarter of to  among other things  extend its maturity from november  to november   is intended to achieve a better balance between fixed rate and floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap had the effect of increasing interest expense in by 
million and lowering interest expense by 
million in at december   the potential annual increase in interest expense from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have been approximately 
million 
in addition  the fair value of the swap can change dramatically based on a number of variables  including a significant change in the shape of the yield curve and the passage of time 
changes in the fair value of the swap are reported as non cash increases or decreases in interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements sales of accounts receivable as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned receivables  during several preceding years and through march   we maintained a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution 
under this arrangement  we sold  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of accounts receivable 
as existing receivables were collected  undivided interests in new eligible receivables were sold 
accounts that became days past due were no longer eligible to be sold and we were at risk for any related credit losses 
credit losses were not significant and we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover our estimated exposures 
on march   this facility was repaid see liquidity and sources of capital 

table of contents during the third quarter of  one of our non us subsidiaries entered into a factoring agreement with a third party financial institution under which it is able to sell without recourse up to million of accounts receivable 
the agreement  which expires on august   replaces a million arrangement with another institution under which sales of accounts receivable were made with recourse 
at december  and december   the gross amounts of accounts receivable that had been sold under these arrangements totaled million and million  respectively 
financing fees related to these arrangements are not material 
sales of notes and guarantees certain of our us operations sell with recourse notes from customers for the purchase of plastics processing machinery 
in certain other cases  we guarantee the repayment of all or a portion of notes payable from our customers to third party lenders 
these arrangements are entered into for the purpose of facilitating sales of machinery 
in the event a customer fails to repay a note  we generally regain title to the machinery 
at december  and december   our maximum exposure under these us guarantees  as well as guarantees by certain of our non us subsidiaries  totaled million and million  respectively 
losses related to sales of notes and guarantees have not been material in the past 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations for and beyond are shown as of december  in the table that follows 
beyond total in millions contractual obligations asset based facility due senior secured notes due other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations a other long term liabilities pension plan contributions b b b unfunded pension benefits c d postretirement medical benefits d e insurance reserves d total a we did not have any significant purchase obligations as of december  b we will be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees and retirees in and beyond 
the amount shown above for is based on the current provisions of the plan  its current funded status and the discount rate required to be used for minimum funding purposes by the pension funding act of this amount is not expected to change significantly  if all 
the amount shown in the column is an estimate of the minimum required contribution in as discussed below 
however  actual contributions for years after cannot be reasonably determined at this time because of the potential effects of new legislation pending in the us congress 
if enacted  this legislation is expected to have the effect of increasing the total required contribution amounts but allowing them to be made over a longer period of time than under current law 
enactment of the legislation could significantly change the estimated minimum required contribution for that is presented above 
in addition  interest rate relief measures that had been in place under the pension funding act of expired on december  and have not yet been replaced 
these relief measures allowed plan sponsors to use higher interest rates based on corporate bond yields to establish funding requirements than would have otherwise been the case 
in this regard  current law would have required the yield on year treasury securities to be used if interest rate relief had not been in place 
in the absence of interest rate relief or new legislation  funding requirements beyond could increase 
table of contents substantially 
we are currently evaluating various alternatives  some of which have the potential of permitting us to satisfy our funding obligations over a longer period 
c represents liabilities related to unfunded pension plans in the us and germany 
d the amounts presented for unfunded pension benefits  other postretirement benefits and insurance reserves are estimates based on current assumptions and expectations 
actual annual payments related to these obligations can be expected to differ from the amounts shown 
the amounts shown for insurance reserves are net of expected recoveries from excess carriers and other third parties totaling million 
e as discussed more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements captioned retirement benefit plans  we have moved prescription drug coverage for retirees who are eligible for medicare from the self funded company plan to third party insurers effective january  this change is expected to result in cash savings in excess of million per year 
the amounts presented above include estimates of these benefits 
the above table excludes the contingent liabilities of up to million related to the loan guarantees that are discussed above 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from december  the december  amount includes million of proceeds that were received from a rights offering that was completed in the fourth quarter of that year 
early in  we used a portion of this cash to repay million of outstanding amounts borrowed under our asset based credit facility and other obligations 
approximately of the million of cash as of december  was held in foreign accounts in support of our non us operations 
were this non us cash to be repatriated  it could result in withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 
at december   approximately million of cash was used to collateralize sales of certain non us receivables 
operating activities provided million of cash in due principally to reductions in accounts receivable and in certain other current and non current assets 
the benefits of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in inventories that resulted from higher order levels 
operating activities used million of cash in due principally to a million payment related to the termination of our receivables purchase agreement on march  the usage of cash in also includes million for the final annual interest payment on the eurobonds  substantially all of which were repurchased on june   and million of cash spent in pursuing alternatives to the refinancing actions that are discussed below 
investing activities used million of cash in  including million for capital expenditures which was partially offset by million from the sale of idle plant facilities 
capital expenditures in included more than million related to the implementation of a new enterprise requirement planning erp system 
additional capital spending for this system will be required in but the amount has not yet been determined 
investing activities used a negligible amount of cash in as capital expenditures of million were substantially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the grinding wheels business

glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc converted the entire principal amount of the series a notes into million shares of common stock on april  the series a notes and series b notes initially bore a combination of cash and pay in kind interest at a total rate of per annum 
the rate was retroactively reset on june  to per annum from the date of issuance  payable in cash 
on march   we also reached a separate agreement with credit suisse first boston for a million senior secured credit facility having a term of approximately one year 
this senior secured credit facility consisted of a million revolving a facility and a million term loan b facility 
on march   we used extensions of credit under the revolving a facility and term loan b facility in an aggregate amount of million to repay and terminate our then existing revolving credit facility in addition to replacing or providing credit support for outstanding letters of credit and our then existing receivables purchase program 
all amounts borrowed under the credit suisse first boston facility were repaid on june   as described below 
on june   i the common stock into which the series a notes were converted and ii the series b notes were exchanged for  shares of series b preferred stock  a new series of convertible preferred stock with a cumulative cash dividend rate of 
on june   we also satisfied the conditions to release to us from escrow the proceeds from the offering of million of senior secured notes due and entered into an agreement for a new million asset based revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank as administrative agent and collateral agent 
on june   we applied the proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes due  together with million in borrowings under our asset based facility and approximately million of cash on hand  to purchase  of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of milacron capital holdings bv s guaranteed bonds due in april at the settlement of a tender offer therefor  terminate and repay million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  which included additional amounts borrowed subsequent to march  we also used million of availability under our asset based facility to replace or provide credit support for the outstanding letters of credit under the revolving a facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  repay the million term loan b facility of the credit suisse first boston facility  and pay transaction expenses 
the borrowings under the asset based facility entered into on june  are secured by a first priority security interest  subject to permitted liens  in  among other things  us and canadian accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and  in the us  certain related rights under contracts  licenses and other general intangibles  subject to certain exceptions 
our asset based facility is also secured by a second priority security interest on the assets that secure the senior secured notes due on a first priority basis 
the availability of loans under our asset based facility is limited to a borrowing base equal to specified percentages of eligible us and canadian accounts receivable and us inventory and is subject to other conditions to borrowing and limitations  including an excess availability reserve the minimum required availability of million and an additional million hedging reserve as a result of the interest rate swap that was entered into on july  
table of contents based on the assets included in the borrowing base as of december  and without giving effect to reserves  outstanding borrowings and issuances of letters of credit in all cases  as discussed below  we had approximately million of borrowing availability  subject to the customary ability of the administrative agent for the lenders to reduce rates  impose or change collateral value limitations  establish reserves and declare certain collateral ineligible from time to time in its reasonable credit judgment  any of which could reduce our borrowing availability at any time 
the terms of our asset based facility impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our us bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
this daily cash sweep is automatically applied to pay down any outstanding borrowings under our asset based facility 
the terms of our asset based facility also provide for the administrative agent  at its option and at any time  to impose a daily cash sweep on cash received in our canadian bank accounts from collections of our accounts receivable 
since the cash we receive from collection of receivables is subject to the automatic sweep to repay the borrowings under our asset based facility on a daily basis  we rely on borrowings under our asset based facility as our primary source of cash for use in our north american operations 
our liquidity could be materially affected if we have no additional availability or are unable to satisfy the borrowing conditions  including  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults including under financial covenants or any material adverse change in the company s business or financial condition 
our asset based facility contains customary conditions precedent to any borrowings  as well as customary covenants  including  but not limited to  maintenance of unused availability under the borrowing base based on reserves including the excess availability reserve and the hedging reserve established by the administrative agent 
as of december   after giving effect to then outstanding letters of credit and the million borrowed under the facility  our availability after deducting the million of reserves was approximately million 
our asset based facility originally contained  for the first five quarters  a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum level of cumulative consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility  to be tested quarterly 
the facility was amended on february  to modify these minimum requirements 
the february  amendment established a minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirement of million for the twelve consecutive calendar months ending december  and also reduced the minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements for periods ending march  june and september of as discussed more fully below  the facility was further amended on february  to add a minimum cumulative total north america ebitda requirement for that becomes effective if borrowing availability falls below specified levels for specified periods 
the facility also contains a limit on capital expenditures that was originally required to be complied with on a quarterly basis through september  but the facility was amended on february  to extend this test through december  and on february  to extend this test through as described below 
we will also have to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested quarterly 
this test was originally to have been effective for the fourth quarter of but was delayed by the february  amendment until the first quarter of under the february  amendment and limited waiver  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio will not apply until beginning with the quarter ending march   and for each quarter ending thereafter  we must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
in connection with delaying effectiveness of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  the february  amendment introduced a minimum cumulative total north america ebitda requirement for the four quarters of fiscal year of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the february  amendment also extended the capital expenditure limitation through december  these two covenants  however  will only apply during if our borrowing availability net of reserves falls below specified levels for specified periods and will not apply if our borrowing availability net of reserves remains above million 
if these two covenants become effective  they can subsequently cease to apply if our borrowing availability remains above specified levels for specified periods 
the february  amendment also corrected a minor technical violation related to an investment and allowed for a change in the method of accounting for certain us plastics machinery inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
concurrently with the february  
table of contents amendment  we made a million prepayment of the facility from the proceeds of our rights offering 
we subsequently used additional proceeds to repay the remaining amounts drawn under the facility 
subsequent to february   we identified adjustments that resulted in reducing fourth quarter ebitda to below the minimum level required under the facility 
however  we reached an agreement with the lenders on march  to waive any noncompliance in the fourth quarter resulting from certain of these adjustments 
accordingly  after giving effect to the waiver  we were in compliance with the ebitda requirements as of december  and march  we subsequently identified additional adjustments that resulted in reducing second quarter ebitda to below the minimum level required under the facility 
however  we reached an agreement with the lenders on june   to waive any noncompliance in the second quarter resulting from certain of these adjustments 
accordingly  after giving effect to this waiver  we were in compliance with the ebitda requirement as of june  the minimum ebitda levels were subsequently reduced by an amendment to the facility that we entered into with the lenders as of july  the february  amendment allowed for certain adjustments to ebitda for the twelve month period ended december  although we were in compliance with the ebitda requirement as of that date without these adjustments  the agreement and limited waiver we entered into with the lenders as of february  waived any potential noncompliance with this requirement that might have resulted without these adjustments 
our ability to continue to meet the cumulative total north america ebitda covenant  if it becomes effective  and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant when it becomes effective will be contingent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these include our need for a continued increase in capital spending in the plastics processing industry and the resulting increases in our sales revenues and operating margins  our need for no material decrease in price realization  our ability to absorb recent raw material price increases or pass such price increases through to customers  and our continued ability to realize the benefits of our cost reduction and process improvement initiatives 
if we are unable to meet or exceed the covenants of our asset based facility  we will attempt to further renegotiate this covenant with our lenders to assure compliance 
however  we cannot control our lenders actions and  if the negotiations are not successful  we could be forced to seek alternative sources of liquidity 
this may include  but is not necessarily limited to  seeking alternative lenders  sales of assets or business units and the issuance of additional indebtedness or equity 
failure to meet or exceed the covenants of our asset based facility would constitute an event of default under the facility  which would permit the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed thereunder if such indebtedness remained unpaid and terminate their commitments to lend 
the acceleration of indebtedness under the asset based facility would also create a cross default under our senior secured notes due if the principal amount of indebtedness accelerated  together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there was a payment default or the maturity had been so accelerated  aggregated million or more  and such cross default would permit the trustee under the indenture governing the senior secured notes due or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding notes to declare the notes to be due and payable immediately 
the acceleration of obligations under our outstanding indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our continued viability depends on realizing anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and continued improvement in demand levels in and beyond  the latter of which is largely beyond our control 
unless we realize anticipated cost savings and operating improvements on schedule and volume and pricing levels continue to improve  we may need to fund interest payments on the senior secured notes in part with the proceeds of borrowings under our asset based facility 
however  our ability to borrow under our asset based facility is subject to borrowing base limitations  including the excess availability reserve and the hedging reserve  which may be adjusted from time to time by the administrative agent for the lenders at its discretion  and our satisfaction of certain conditions to borrowing  including  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults including under financial covenants or any material adverse change in our business or financial condition 
in particular  our continued ability to borrow under our asset based facility is contingent on our ability to comply with financial covenants  including meeting the minimum cumulative total north america ebitda requirement  if effective  the fixed charge coverage 
table of contents ratio  when effective  and other conditions to borrowing as discussed above 
if we have no additional availability or are otherwise unable to borrow against the facility  our liquidity would be impaired and we would need to pursue the alternative sources of liquidity discussed above to service our debt and pay our expenses 
there is no assurance that we would be able to sell assets  refinance debt or raise equity on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations under our indebtedness  as discussed above 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or draw sufficient amounts under our asset based facility to satisfy our debt obligations and pay our other expenses could cause us to default on our obligations and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
borrowings under our asset based facility bear interest  at our option  at either i the libo rate plus the applicable margin as defined below or ii an abr plus the applicable margin as defined below 
the applicable margin  with respect to eurodollar loans  is between per annum and per annum and  with respect to abr loans  is between 
per annum and per annum  determined based on a calculation of the trailing average availability levels under our asset based facility 
libo rate means the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted 
we may elect eurodollar loan interest periods of one  two or three months 
abr means the higher of i the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in new york city or ii the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 
our asset based facility provides that we will pay a monthly unused line fee equal to 
per annum on the average daily unused portion of our credit commitment  as well as customary loan servicing and letter of credit issuance fees 
our asset based facility provides that upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under our asset based facility  upon demand by the agent  we will have to pay i in the case of revolving credit loans  a rate of interest per annum equal to the rate of interest otherwise in effect assuming the rate in effect is at the maximum applicable margin pursuant to the terms of our asset based facility plus and ii in the case of other amounts  a rate of interest per annum equal to the abr plus the maximum applicable margin plus 
at december   we had other lines of credit with various us and non us banks totaling approximately million  of which approximately million was available under certain circumstances 
our debt and credit are rated by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s 
on december   s p announced that it had lowered our corporate credit rating from b with a stable outlook to ccc with a negative outlook 
our senior secured debt rating was lowered from ccc to ccc 
on january   moody s reaffirmed the rating of our senior secured notes and our corporate family rating at caa and changed its outlook from positive to negative 
none of our debt instruments include rating triggers that would accelerate maturity or increase interest rates in the event of a ratings downgrade 
accordingly  any potential rating downgrades would have no significant short term effect  although they could potentially affect the types and cost of credit facilities and debt instruments available to us in the future 
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities during  which will be partially offset by approximately million for capital expenditures which includes amounts related to the previously discussed erp system 
we believe that our current cash position  cash flow from operations and available credit lines  including our asset based revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for cautionary statement we wish to caution readers about all of the forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis section and elsewhere 
these include all statements that speak about the future or are based on our interpretation of factors that might affect our businesses 
we believe the following important factors  among others  
table of contents could affect our actual results in and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements our ability to comply with financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness  including our senior secured notes and asset based credit facility  our ability to remediate or otherwise mitigate any material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or significant deficiencies that may be identified  global and regional economic conditions  consumer spending  capital spending levels and industrial production  particularly in segments related to the level of automotive production and spending in the plastics and construction industries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates of us and foreign countries  including countries in europe and asia where we have several principal manufacturing facilities and where many of our customers  competitors and suppliers are based  fluctuations in interest rates which affect the cost of borrowing  production and pricing levels of important raw materials  including plastic resins  which are a key material used by purchasers of our plastics technologies products  as well as steel  oil and chemicals  lower than anticipated levels of plant utilization resulting in production inefficiencies and higher costs  whether related to the delay of new product introductions  improved production processes or equipment  or labor relations issues  customer acceptance of new products introduced during and products expected to be introduced in  any major disruption in production at key customer or supplier facilities or at our facilities  disruptions in global or regional commerce due to wars  to social  civil or political unrest in the non us countries in which we operate and to acts of terrorism  continued threats of terrorism and military  political and economic responses including heightened security measures to terrorism  alterations in trade conditions in and between the us and us countries where we do business  including export duties  import controls  quotas and other trade barriers  changes in tax  environmental and other laws and regulations in the us and us countries where we do business  litigation  claims or assessments  including but not limited to claims or problems related to product liability  warranty or environmental issues  fluctuations in stock market valuations of pension plan assets or changes in interest rates that could result in increased pension expense and reduced shareholders equity and require us to make significant cash contributions in the future  and our ability to extend our pension funding obligations for and beyond over a longer period of time  or otherwise be able to fund our pension funding obligations when they become due
