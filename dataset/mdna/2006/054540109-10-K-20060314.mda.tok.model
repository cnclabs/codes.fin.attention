overview axcelis technologies  inc axcelis  we  us  or our  is a worldwide producer of ion implantation  dry strip  thermal processing and curing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services 
we own of the equity of a joint venture known as sumitomo eaton nova corporation  or sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
sen licenses technology from us relating to the manufacture of specified ion implantation products and has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products in the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry has in the past been subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenues and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  could fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
our gross margins are also affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
for example  our gross margins in  and were adversely affected in part as a result of the increased proportion of relatively new systems sold to process mm wafers 
we expect gross margins to decline in due to sales of our new single wafer implant products 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we could experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenues as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the substantial expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and joint venturing within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase competitive pricing as higher percentages of our total revenues are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
the years and are transition years in implant products and technology 
while customers continue to buy multi wafer tools  leading edge customers are shifting to single wafer tools 
we introduced our single wafer optima platform in and have development projects underway to produce and launch our next generation of single wafer products 
axcelis accesses the important japanese market for certain ion implant systems through a joint venture known as sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
that we do not control 
the joint venture agreement gives both owners veto rights  so that neither owner alone can effectively control sen 
sen s business is subject to the same risks as our business 
royalties and equity income from sen have made a substantial contribution to our earnings  and a substantial decline in sen s sales and net income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
as a result of this joint venture structure  we have less control over sen management than over our own management and may not have timely knowledge of factors affecting sen s business 
in addition  given the equal ownership  it is possible that the sen board may be unable to reach consensus on important matters from time to time which could delay important decisions 
the license agreement between sen and axcelis continues in its existing form on a year to year basis  subject to the right of either party to terminate 
under the sen bylaws  termination of the license agreement by sen would be an important matter requiring approval of a majority of the sen directors 
given axcelis representation on the sen board  the license agreement will be perpetual until such time as axcelis deems a termination to be in our interest 
axcelis has no present intent to terminate the sen license agreement 
during  axcelis and sen sought to agree on amendments to the license agreement to add additional licensed products and related royalty terms  but no agreement has been reached as of march  as a result the current license agreement between sen and axcelis continues in its existing form 
operating results for the future years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or for the year as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition axcelis revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described in detail below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
for revenue arrangements prior to july   axcelis generally recognized the full sale price at the time of shipment to the customer 
the costs of system installation at the customer s site were accrued at the time of shipment 
in addition  the estimated costs of standard and non standard warranties were accrued at the time of shipment 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements entered into in periods beginning after june  for revenue arrangements occurring on or after july   we have revised our revenue recognition policy to comply with the provisions of eitf and subsequently the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of systems under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to systems revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
system revenue is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
management continues to believe recognition of systems revenue at the time of shipment is appropriate because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that newer systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers of mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system or for initial shipments of systems with new technologies  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
services revenue includes revenue from spare parts  equipment upgrades and maintenance services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to time and material services is recognized when the services are performed 
revenue related to spare parts sales and equipment upgrades is recognized upon the later of shipment or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and are generally amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
impairment reviews may be performed more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the business unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our annual review conducted as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and a significant decrease in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty axcelis offers a one to three year product warranty  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue systems services royalties  primarily from sen cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges income loss from operations other income expense equity income of sen interest income interest expense other net income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue systems revenue was million  or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the decrease in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to weaker market demand resulting from lower levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
also  while the effect is not yet quantifiable  systems revenue has also declined because semiconductor manufacturers are shifting away from our multi wafer high current ion implant systems to single wafer high current ion implant systems 
the high current segment constitutes approximately fifty percent of the worldwide ion implant market 
our first shipment of our new single wafer high dose ion implant system is expected in we began shipping our new mid dose single wafer ion implant system in  but have not yet recognized revenue for any such shipments to date 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and were from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
this highlights the market trend towards mm products and the decrease in expansion of facilities using mm products 
services revenue  which includes spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for services revenue fluctuates with capacity utilization by our customers  and the decline in services revenue for is attributable to declining utilization by semiconductor manufacturers 
as described above in revenue recognition  a portion of our systems revenue is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
royalty revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
revenue changes are mainly attributed to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million  or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in worldwide revenues including revenues of sen  for the years ending december  and were million and million  respectively 
worldwide revenues decreased compared with due to the decline in demand for semiconductor equipment and the transition to single wafer  high dose ion implant systems  as discussed above  as well as the timing of shipments in japan 
axcelis believes that the information regarding the aggregate annual revenues of sen  a owned unconsolidated subsidiary of axcelis  combined with axcelis own revenues for the year  is useful to investors 
sen s ion implant products are covered by a license from axcelis and  therefore  the combined revenue of the two companies indicates the full market penetration of axcelis technology 
gross profit gross profit was of revenue in compared with of revenue in the gross profit decrease of 
percentage points was the result of unfavorable systems cost and product mix approximately percentage points  unfavorable systems volume approximately percentage points and margin sen royalties approximately 
percentage points  offset by an increased percentage of parts and service volume and margins approximately percentage points  and lower warranty costs approximately 
percentage points 
research and development research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by expenses associated with the timing of project material usage  supplies and contract labor million and increased amortization related to manufactured products used in research and development million 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with variable compensation million and lower payroll and payroll related expenses million 
increases in overall research and development expenses in compared with are attributable to development efforts related to our single wafer optima platform 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities in  for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared with million in this decrease was driven primarily by lower payroll and payroll related expenses associated with reduction in force actions million and lower commission expense million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared with million in this decrease was driven primarily by lower costs associated with variable compensation million  reduced salary expense million and reduced supplies costs million offset by costs associated with the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts million 
restructuring restructuring expense of million in consists primarily of severance and other one time termination benefits related to reduction in force actions and the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
in total  we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring and general and administrative expenses related to these actions  of which million has been recognized as expense since the fourth quarter of we expect to incur approximately million in additional expense over the first quarter of of the total cost related to these actions  approximately million is expected to result in cash expenditures  of which million has been paid through december  the accruals for severance and retention are expected to be paid over the first six months of the lease charges are expected to be paid over the remaining lease periods extending to the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity is not significant  as these actions are expected to yield equivalent actual cash savings within twelve months 
changes in our restructuring liability are as follows severance retention leases leasehold improvements total in thousands balance at december  restructuring expense cash payments non cash impairment balance at december  other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased by million from due primarily to higher interest rates earned on invested balances 
interest expense of million in and million in primarily relates to our long term debt issued in january income taxes income tax expense for was million 
income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating losses in the united states and certain foreign tax jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  do not pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions nor have the ability to obtain tax benefit for such losses 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue systems revenue was million  or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the increase in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to strong market demand resulting from high levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
approximately of systems revenue for was from the sales of mm products and was from the sales of mm products  compared with and  for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
sales of mm products were strong during due to the expansion of existing mm production capacity that outpaced the investment in new mm fabrication facilities 
services revenue  which includes spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for services revenue fluctuates with capacity utilization by our customers  and the increase in services revenue for compared with was a result of increased capacity utilization by our customers which has a direct effect on demand for both spare parts and billable labor 
in addition  as the out of warranty installed base increased  demand for service maintenance contracts also increased 
as described above in revenue recognition  a portion of our systems revenue is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
royalty revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are primarily earned under our license agreement with sen 
revenue changes are mainly attributed to fluctuations in the sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million  or  of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the higher proportion of total revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and services in is primarily a result of capacity expansion by semiconductor manufacturers whereby capital spending for ion implantation products has outpaced increases in total wafer fabrication equipment spending 
worldwide revenues  including revenues of sen  for the years ending december  and were million and million  respectively 
worldwide revenues increased by million compared to due to the growth in demand for equipment by semiconductor manufacturers discussed above 
axcelis believes that the information regarding the aggregate annual revenues of sen  a owned unconsolidated subsidiary of axcelis  combined with axcelis own revenues for the year  is useful to investors 
sen s ion implant products are covered by a license from axcelis and therefore the combined revenue of the two companies indicates the full market penetration of axcelis technology 
gross profit gross profit was of revenue in compared with of revenue in the gross profit increase of percentage points was primarily due to increased sales volume and the related increased absorption of fixed manufacturing costs approximately percentage points  reduced system warranty costs approximately percentage points and improved pricing approximately percentage point due to favorable market conditions which provided increased demand and an expanded customer base 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  compared with million in while research and development expenses remained primarily flat year over year  the individual components varied 
increased variable compensation million and expenses associated with the timing of projects million were offset in part by lower amortization related to demo tools used in r d million  lower payroll and payroll related expense primarily due to headcount reductions million  lower facility costs allocated to research and development million  and lower fixed costs associated with depreciation and leased equipment million 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million for  an increase of million  or  compared with million for primarily due to increased expenses for customer and evaluation tool support million  travel associated with increased volume million  and commissions million 
cost increases were offset in part by lower payroll and payroll related expense primarily due to our september restructuring million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in general and administrative expense increased in primarily due to increased variable compensation million  higher audit fees and costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act million 
in addition  general and administrative expense in was reduced by an adjustment of million to reflect a change in estimate relating to unfunded pension and other benefits recorded in prior years 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in the increase was due to a full year of amortization expense relating to the intangible assets acquired as part of the matrix integrated systems  inc acquisition completed on july  restructuring restructuring expense of million in consists primarily of severance and other one time termination benefits related to reduction in force actions and the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
changes in our restructuring liability are as follows severance retention total balance at december  restructuring expense cash payments balance at december  other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased by million from due primarily to increased levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in  as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense of million in primarily relates to our long term debt issued in january interest expense increased by million compared with due primarily to the amortization of bank fees associated with the october renegotiation of our revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
income taxes income tax expense for was reduced by million from the reversal of income tax accruals recorded in prior years for certain tax matters that were resolved in the second quarter of income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
income tax expense attributable to us operations is minimal because taxable income derived from the current year operating results is substantially offset by available net operating loss carryforwards 
we have significant net operating losses in the united states and certain foreign tax jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  do not pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions nor have the ability to obtain tax benefit for such losses 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments is mainly attributable to million in cash used by operations  million used for capital expenditures  and increases in restricted cash balances of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility in beverly  massachusetts 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than foreign exchange contracts used to hedge amounts receivable from sen million at december  
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in october we expect to be able to renew the credit facility when it expires 
the purpose of the facility is to provide funds for working capital and general corporate purposes as required 
to the extent that we have borrowings under the agreement  those borrowings would bear interest at the bank s base rate  as defined in the agreement  or libor plus an applicable percentage 
we have no plans to borrow against the facility but may use the facility to support letters of credit in the future 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding our investment in sen and contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on the payment of dividends  minimum levels of tangible net worth  liquidity and profitability as well as maximum levels of indebtedness and capital spending 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we incur an annual commitment fee based on an ebitda formula outlined in the agreement applied to the full commitment 
we have million of outstanding convertible debentures that mature in january we believe that our existing cash balances  expected positive cash flows for  and anticipated access to bank financing will allow us to repay the debt when it matures without causing a liquidity issue 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe 
in addition  at december   million of cash was pledged as collateral for certain outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees  and is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt including interest purchase order commitments operating leases amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter unused line of credit standby letters of credit guarantees axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas in november the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   however early adoption is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november we adopted sfas effective january  adopting sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires that changes in accounting principle be retrospectively applied 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r on december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the determination of net income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is not an alternative 
we adopted sfas r effective january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective approach includes the requirements of the modified prospective approach  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted the modified prospective approach 
as permitted by sfas  we currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method  and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method will have a significant impact on results of operations  although it will have no impact on overall financial position 
the effects of the adoption of sfas r on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon a number of factors  including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested  the number of stock based awards which may be granted in the future  the life and vesting features of stock based awards which may be granted in the future  the future market value and volatility of axcelis stock  movements in the risk free rate of interest  award exercise and forfeiture patterns  and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award 
in addition  we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key component of its ongoing employee incentive based compensation plan 
these awards generally are recorded at their fair value  equal to the quoted market price of axcelis common stock on the date of issuance  and this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee 
we estimate the adoption of sfas r will increase compensation expense in the range of to million for the year ending december  of which million represents estimated compensation expense for options issued at december  and the remainder represents estimated compensation expense for assumed option issuances 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
because we do not recognize the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost due to our net operating loss position  this change will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook our performance is directly related to semiconductor manufacturers levels of capital expenditures to open new fabrication facilities and expand existing ones  as well as operational improvements we have implemented over the past several years 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products utilizing them  the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers fabrication facilities  and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without incurring additional capital expenditures 
on february   we announced that net revenues excluding sen for the first quarter of are forecast in the range of million to million 
worldwide revenues  including sen  are expected to be million to million 
gross margins are projected in the range 
we expect results of operations to approximate breakeven for the quarter 
in addition  we provided a summary of expectations for the total year 
revenues are anticipated to increase to percent over levels with revenues from sales of our single wafer optima products to exceed of total systems revenues 
shipments of optima products  not all of which will be recognized as revenue in  should be in the range of to million 
gross margins are expected to remain at approximately and expense levels should remain comparable with levels 
cash flow is expected to be positive 
it is difficult to predict our customers capital spending plans since they can change very quickly 
at our current sales level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on our results of operations in a particular quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities and limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
to the extent we have borrowings in the future under the revolving credit facility  such borrowings would be exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in the bank s base rate or libor 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results
