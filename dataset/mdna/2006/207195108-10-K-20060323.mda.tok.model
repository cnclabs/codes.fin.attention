item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the same economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
in addition to external economic factors  the company s results are sensitive to sales and manufacturing volume  competitors pricing  consumer preferences for flooring products  raw material costs and the mix of products sold 
the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires substantial investment in facilities and equipment 
the cost of operating these facilities generally does not vary in direct proportion to production volume and  consequently  operating results fluctuate disproportionately with changes in sales volume 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  the company filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
in november  congoleum filed the fourth plan with the bankruptcy court reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee  the future claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures in december and congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of the fourth plan 
in april  congoleum announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with representatives of the asbestos claimants committee and the future claimants representative to make certain modifications to its proposed plan of reorganization and related documents governing the settlement and payment of asbestos related claims against congoleum 
under the agreed upon modifications  asbestos claimants with claims settled under congoleum s pre petition settlement agreements would agree to forbear from exercising the security interest they were granted and share on a pari passu basis with all other present and future asbestos claimants in insurance proceeds and other assets of the plan trust 
in july  congoleum filed the sixth plan and related documents with the bankruptcy court which reflected the result of these negotiations as well as other technical modifications 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and voting procedures and congoleum commenced solicitation of acceptances of the sixth plan in august in september  congoleum learned that certain asbestos claimants were unwilling to agree to forbear from exercising their security interest as contemplated by the sixth plan and the sixth plan was subsequently withdrawn 
in november  the bankruptcy court denied a request to extend congoleum s exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization and solicit acceptances thereof 
in february  congoleum filed the seventh plan 
on february   the company announced its intention to make additional changes to its plan of reorganization  and on march  it filed a new amended plan the eighth plan 
in addition  an insurance company has filed the cna plan and the official committee of bondholders has filed the bondholder plan 
the bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing to consider the adequacy of the disclosure statements with respect to these plans for april  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain approval to solicit acceptances for the eighth plan  that the company will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation of the eighth plan  that the eighth plan will not be modified further  that the eighth plan will receive necessary court approvals from the bankruptcy court or the federal district court  or that such approvals will be received in a timely fashion  that the eighth plan will be confirmed  or that the eighth plan  if confirmed  will become effective 
it is unclear whether the bankruptcy court will approve the cna plan or the bondholder plan or whether either of such plans  if confirmed  would be feasible 
moreover  it is unclear whether any other person will attempt to propose a plan or what any such plan would provide or propose  and whether the bankruptcy court would approve a plan other than congoleum s proposed plan 
congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and related matters and are expected to file objections to the eighth plan 
certain other parties have also filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and may file objections to the eighth plan 
the company expects that the terms of the eighth plan may be amended or modified as a result of further negotiations with various parties 
the terms of the cna plan and the bondholder plan are materially different from the terms of the eighth plan  and these plans may also be amended  modified or may be withdrawn 
there can be no assurance that the terms of the reorganization plan that is ultimately confirmed  if any  will not materially differ from the terms of the eighth plan 
the company expects that it will take until some time in the fourth quarter of at the earliest to obtain confirmation of any plan of reorganization 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos personal injury claimants the claimant agreement  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  congoleum also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement and granting the collateral trust a security interest in congoleum s rights under its applicable insurance coverage and payments from congoleum s insurers for asbestos claims 
in december  congoleum commenced the avoidance actions seeking to void the security interest granted to the collateral trust and such settlements 
under the terms of the eighth plan  asbestos personal injury claimants voting to accept the plan would irrevocably consent or would be deemed to have irrevocably consented to the forbearance of any claim and lien rights under the claimant agreement and related agreements 
under the terms of the eighth plan  after the establishment of the plan trust  the assets in the collateral trust would be transferred to the plan trust and any claims subject to the claimant agreement would be channeled to the plan trust and paid in accordance with the terms of the eighth plan 
settlement values under the eighth plan may differ from values under the sixth plan and the claimant agreement  which  together with the outcome of the avoidance actions  may materially affect the liability associated with the asbestos personal injury claims against congoleum 
as a result of tabulating ballots on the fourth plan  the company is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in the sixth plan 
based on the eighth plan  the company has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through the plan trust 
the company recorded charges aggregating approximately million in prior years and a further approximately million in  to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the eighth plan or any other plan of reorganization could be materially higher than currently recorded 
the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
delays in proposing  filing or obtaining approval of the eighth plan or any new amended plan of reorganization  or the continued pursuit of the cna plan or the bondholder plan by the proponents of such plans  or the proposal of additional plans by other parties could result in a proceeding that takes longer and is more costly than the company has estimated 
for more information regarding the company s asbestos liability and plan for resolving that liability  please refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of the this annual report on form k 
in addition  please refer to risk factors the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and any plan of reorganization may not be confirmed contained in item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability through a plan of reorganization

the increase in sales resulted primarily from the impact of selling price increases instituted in late and during of net sales  and higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry reflecting post hurricane demand for both manufactured housing and rv homes 
this was partially offset by a sales decrease of do it yourself tile reflecting the loss of a major mass merchandiser customer coupled with decreased demand for residential sheet products 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margins was driven by the sharp increase in raw material pricing which increased costs by of net sales  a less favorable product mix which reduced gross margin by of net sales  and the negative impact of lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs of net sales 
this was partially mitigated by price increases instituted during late and of net sales  lower warranty claims expense of net sales and the favorable impact of manufacturing cost reduction programs initiated of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses were down million of net sales reflecting cost savings initiatives instituted in late  including workforce reductions and related benefits million  and the impact of lower unit sales volume on freight and other incentive programs million 
asbestos related charges in were million  compared to million in the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that the company would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of the company s proposed plan of reorganization 
if the company is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the eighth plan also would require the company to make contributions to the plan trust comprised of approximately million in cash  any net recoveries in excess of the maximum additional bondholder recovery  million shares of newly issued class a common stock and a convertible security 
the redemption value of the convertible security will be increased one year after confirmation of the plan to the amount  if any  by which of the value of the company s shares at that time exceeds approximately million 
no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution of increased redemption value  which could be material 
the company will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the convertible security will require the company to make dividend or interest payments prior to such security s redemption or maturity date 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the same period in the prior year  a decline of million 
this decline in operating income reflects the charges for asbestos related claims taken in  coupled with lower gross margins  partially offset by reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was million  which was million higher than the prior year reflecting higher cash balances and interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the interest accrued on the unpaid interest on its senior notes 
due to the chapter proceedings  the company was precluded from making the interest payments due february   august   february  and august  on the senior notes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in  and it also recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which the company has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized

the increase in sales resulted from the effect of selling price increases initiated during and higher shipments to the manufactured housing industry partially offset by declines in do it yourself tile sales to mass merchandisers and less demand for residential sheet specials 
gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in gross margins were driven by the impact of the price increase of net sales  improvement in product mix due to a high end residential sheet introduction of net sales coupled with improved manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost reduction programs initiated during the second half of of net sales 
these factors helped offset sharply higher raw material costs experienced during the second half of the year  which negatively impacted gross margins by of net sales 
the significant raw material inflation experienced in is expected to continue into  and will reduce profit margins to the extent it cannot be recovered through price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower selling  general and administrative expenses reflect the impact of several cost savings initiatives instituted in the second half of  including work force reductions million  and reduced merchandising and sampling expenses reflecting new product launch expenses incurred in million 
these initiatives  coupled with further cost reduction steps taken in the fall of  helped offset the inflationary cost impact of pension medical benefits and other incentive programs million 
the company recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of to increase its estimated recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the then minimum estimated cost that the company would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of the company s then proposed plan of reorganization 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the same period in the prior year  an improvement of million 
this improvement in operating income reflects higher sales and margins coupled with reductions in operating expenses 
interest income was unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting the interest accrued on the unpaid interest due on the senior notes 
due to the chapter proceedings  the company was precluded from making the interest payments due february  and august  on the senior notes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million on income before taxes of million in this relates primarily to anticipated tax benefits associated with certain prior year expenditures for resolving asbestos related liabilities  which the company has determined may be carried back but were not previously recognized 
liquidity and capital resources the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of the company s bankruptcy proceedings 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  the company paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the eighth plan and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when congoleum or the plan trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
there can be no assurances that these reimbursements will be received  or that the terms providing for such reimbursements will not be modified 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan of reorganization  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million at a minimum in connection with insurance coverage litigation costs  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
required expenditures could be materially higher than these estimates 
the company currently holds million in restricted cash that may be available to offset future costs incurred pursuing insurance coverage  subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
due to the chapter proceedings  the company has been precluded from making interest payments on its outstanding senior notes since january  the amount of accrued interest that is due but has not been paid on the senior notes during this period is approximately million  including interest on the unpaid interest due 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered a law firm formerly representing congoleum to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
the law firm is expected to appeal from this ruling once an order embodying the ruling has been entered by the bankruptcy court 
it is expected that the amount of the disgorgement will range from approximately million to million 
pursuant to the terms of the eighth plan  holders of the senior notes would forego million in interest accrued during the post petition period and would receive the right to any funds net of related expenses from the fee disgorgement and other causes of action against the law firm and one of its service providers  subject to a maximum of million plus interest at from the effective date of the plan until the time such payment is made the maximum additional bondholder recovery 
there can be no assurance that the plan  which is ultimately confirmed  will provide for such interest forgiveness 
any net recoveries in excess of the maximum additional bondholder recovery would be paid to the plan trust 
pursuant to the terms of the eighth plan  congoleum is to make a cash contribution of approximately million to the plan trust when the plan goes effective 
the eighth plan also provides that the maturity of the senior notes will be extended by three years from august to august there can be no assurance that the plan which is ultimately confirmed  will provide for such maturity extension 
as part of the eighth plan  congoleum expects that it will issue a convertible security the new convertible security to the plan trust 
under the terms of the eighth plan  the new convertible security means either shares of preferred stock or convertible promissory notes to be issued by reorganized congoleum and contributed to the plan trust on the effective date of the eight plan in satisfaction of section g of the bankruptcy code 
if the new convertible security is to be shares of preferred stock of reorganized congoleum  it shall have the following terms i an initial liquidation preference equal to  in the aggregate  such amount being subject to increase in the amount  if any  by which of reorganized congoleum s market capitalization based on average trading prices for reorganized congoleum s class a common stock at the close of trading for the consecutive trading days beginning on the one year anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization  exceeds such initial liquidation preference  ii an initial dividend rate equal to of the liquidation preference per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  with such dividend rate to reset at the rate of of the liquidation preference per annum on the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization and payable at such reset dividend rate per annum unless and until redeemed  iii redeemable for the liquidation preference at the option of the plan trust or reorganized congoleum following the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization  iv a mandatory redemption on the fifteenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan of reorganization if not redeemed earlier  v convertible into  shares of class a common stock or the equivalent thereof on a fully diluted basis upon a specified default of the obligation to pay dividends and a failure to cure such default within any cure period  which  when combined with the million newly issued shares of class a common stock to be contributed to the plan trust  will result in the plan trust owning of the voting common shares of reorganized congoleum on a fully diluted basis  and vi no voting rights 
if the new convertible security is convertible promissory notes  such notes will be on economic terms substantially equivalent to provisions i and v of the preferred stock described herein  with other terms substantially the same as the promissory note described in the sixth plan 
although the earliest redemption or repayment date for the new convertible security does not occur until its tenth anniversary of issuance  this obligation may affect congoleum s ability to obtain other sources of financing or refinance existing obligations 
in addition  it is expected that the terms of the new convertible security will require the company to make regularly scheduled dividend or interest payments prior to such instrument s redemption or maturity date 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on the company s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by the company to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  million remaining from a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to the lien of the collateral trust  is included as restricted cash at december  the company expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust 
working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  compared to to at december  the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was to compared to to at december  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million in net cash from operations decreased from to due to a decline in operating results  lower accrued expenses and the non recurrence of the one time benefit realized in from the resumption of normal trade credit which had contracted at the end of capital expenditures in totaled million 
the company is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on december  with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for the company to borrow from the facility 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
the company anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation and effectiveness of its plan of reorganization 
while the company expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that the company will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility as extended will be renewed prior to its expiration if the company s plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  the company has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against the company 
among these claims  the company is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of the company s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
the company has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against the company 
the company s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
the company generated million in cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  which includes the benefit of million of accrued but unpaid interest on long term debt 
the company believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
to meet the funding obligations under the eighth plan  the company anticipates it will need to obtain the contemplated forgiveness of million of interest on the senior notes and obtain reimbursement for any unreimbursed coverage litigation costs 
actual sources and uses of funds to consummate the effectiveness of the eighth plan or any other plan may differ from this description  but confirmation of any plan is dependent on such plan demonstrating it leaves the company with sufficient liquidity that further reorganization will not be needed 
the company s inability to obtain confirmation of the eighth plan in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations  adjusted for terms of the eighth plan  for future principal and interest payments on its debt  future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases  future minimum pension plans and opeb funding and obligations to the plan trust pursuant to the eighth plan at december  the company does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars and total thereafter long term debt   interest on long term debt        operating leases       pension plans funding        opeb funding   contribution to trust   principal and dividends or interest on new convertible security to plan trust   the principal and interest payments assume congoleum s reorganization plan is effective as of december  and that million of interest during the pendency of the reorganization is forgiven  and the maturity date of the senior note is extended by three years  as contemplated in the eighth plan 
the projected pension plans funding was actuarially determined using the following assumptions i current funding laws remain unchanged  ii there are no gains or losses for and later  iii the discount rates used for the projection are the same as the rates used for the pension valuations as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k  and iv for years after  projected contributions are assumed to increase with inflation 
congoleum s other post employment benefit plan is an unfunded plan 
funding requirements each year are assumed to approximate the expenses for each year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
payments of cash  principal and dividends or interest to the plan trust assume congoleum s eighth plan is effective december  and do not include any additional principal or dividends or interest thereon resulting from any adjustments to the new convertible security upon the one year anniversary of the plan effective date 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and estimates  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  the company is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  the company paid million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the eighth plan and related documents  congoleum is entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
the amount and timing of reimbursements that will be received will depend on when congoleum or the plan trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
there can be no assurances that these reimbursements will be received or that the terms providing for such reimbursements will not be modified 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan of reorganization  which amount is recorded in its reserve for asbestos related liabilities in addition to the million insurance settlement being held as restricted cash 
it also expects to spend a further million at a minimum in connection with insurance coverage litigation costs  for which it expects to be reimbursed as discussed above 
the company currently holds million in restricted cash that may be available to offset future costs incurred pursuing insurance coverage  subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
required expenditures could be materially higher than these estimates 
the company expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of the company itself 
the company does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
in light of its bankruptcy filing and proposed plan of reorganization  the company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
the company estimates the minimum remaining amount of the contributions and costs to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
these amounts do not include the liability associated with a million insurance settlement recorded as restricted cash  which the company expects to contribute  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust 
at december  this liability comprised of the original settlement plus interest to date  less million in reimbursements approved by the bankruptcy court amounted to million and is included in current asbestos related liabilities 
the company is not yet able to determine the additional costs that may be required to effect a new amended plan  and actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing any plan of reorganization could be materially higher 
the company will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of lifo cost or market 
the lifo last in  first out method of determining cost is used for substantially all inventories 
the company records as a charge to cost of goods sold any amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to the net realizable sales value 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
at december   the company has provided a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
environmental contingencies the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its financial statements for its estimate of costs and insurance recoveries for future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of cleanup activities to be performed  the methods employed in the cleanup activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
pension plans and post retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of the expected return on plan assets which is further described below 
under sfas no 
 the effects of the actual performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income or expense are amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets which produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in determining pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses million loss at december  will ultimately be recognized as an adjustment to future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the company accounts for its post retirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a actuarial basis 
these amounts are projected based on the january  sfas no 
valuation and the year end disclosure assumptions  including a discount rate of and health care cost trend rates of in reducing to an ultimate rate of in item a
