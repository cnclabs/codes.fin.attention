overview general 
we are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services  including airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals  vacation packages and cruises 
we offer our customers a unique choice the ability to purchase travel services in a traditional  price disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique name your own price service  which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices 
at present  we derive substantially all of our revenues from the following sources transaction revenues from our name your own price airline ticket  hotel room and rental car services  as well as our vacation packages service  commissions earned from the sale of price disclosed hotel rooms  rental cars  cruises and other travel services  customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both name your own price and price disclosed airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars service  worldspan  lp reservation booking fees related to both our name your own price airline ticket  hotel room and rental car service  and price disclosed airline tickets and rental car service  transaction revenue from our price disclosed hotel room service  and other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites 
trends 
the online sale of travel services has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the internet since the late s 
while the online market for travel services continues to experience significant annualized growth  we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributors  like priceline 
com  has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed 
we believe the decline in market share is attributable  in part  to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and establish more direct control over their pricing 
in addition  over the course of  airlines and hotel chains have generally experienced year over year increases in load factors a common metric that measures airplane customer usage and occupancy rates a common metric that measures hotel customer usage  respectively  which leaves them with less excess inventory to provide third party intermediaries like priceline 
com 
notwithstanding these trends  we continue to believe that the market for online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for growth  in particular  in certain international markets 
because we believe that an opportunity for growth exists in certain international markets  and since prior to the fourth quarter of  substantially all of our revenue was generated in the us  we have taken steps to expand the markets we serve 
in september  we acquired active hotels ltd  a uk based online hotel service 
active hotels gives us a strong presence in the uk s online hotel market 
furthermore  in july  we acquired amsterdam based bookings bv  one of europe s leading internet hotel reservation services  with offices primarily in amsterdam  barcelona  berlin  loule  paris  rome and pisa 
all of our european operations  including active hotels and bookings  are majority owned by us 
a minority interest in our european business is held by our managers responsible for that business 
we work with a range of chain owned and independently owned hotels across europe and in major cities around the world to provide hotel reservations on various websites in multiple languages 
our european operations are an important contributor to our business and we expect that over the course of  they will represent a growing percentage of our total gross bookings and net income 
in addition to the ongoing businesses of our european operations  which consist primarily of offering european hotel rooms to european customers  over the course of  we intend to offer european customers access to our us based travel services and to enhance the european travel services that we currently offer us customers 
as our european operations become more meaningful contributors to our results  we have seen  and expect to continue to see  changes in certain of our operating expenses and other financial metrics 
for example  because our european operations utilize online affiliate marketing and internet search engines  principally through the purchase of travel related keywords  as principal means of generating traffic to their websites  our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies  a trend we expect to continue throughout in addition  and as discussed in more detail below  since the acquisitions of active hotels and bookings  we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuation on our results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our european hotel service as well as our domestic retail hotel service and the increased importance european hotel bookings to our results of operations 
our overall financial prospects and  in particular  the financial prospects of our domestic business  have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and  as a result  the health of our business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry 
most domestic airlines  and many of our major suppliers  have experienced  and continue to experience  significant losses 
these losses have been compounded by competition from low cost carriers and  more recently  by high fuel prices  which we believe increase the possibility of the additional bankruptcy and or the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic airlines 
as a result of these and other factors  many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share  simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain airline tickets and  as discussed in more detail in other below  put pressure on third party intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution costs 
these actions have had  and continue to have  a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and  in particular  our name your own price airline ticket service  which historically represented a significant portion of our total airline ticket revenues 
as a result of the continued decline in sales of name your own price airline tickets over the last several years  we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue among non opaque services  such as allowing our customers to purchase price disclosed retail airline  hotel and rental car travel services  which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal 
we intend to continue to execute on our strategy of diversifying our service offerings and markets  through both continued internal development of services and  if appropriate  acquisitions 
as a result of the diversification described above  the growth rates for our agency businesses  which are generally comprised of our price disclosed retail services  have  over the recent past  significantly exceeded the growth rates for our merchant businesses  which are comprised primarily of our slower growing name your own price services 
other 
a number of travel suppliers  particularly airlines  have indicated publicly that  as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs  they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be expensive distribution channels such as global distribution systems gdss 
a number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the gds 
we have agreed to rebate certain gds costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating to inventory pricing and availability  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
additionally  travel suppliers are encouraging third party travel intermediaries  such as us  to develop technology to bypass the gds  such as enabling direct connections to the travel suppliers or using other alternatives to traditional gdss 
development of such technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects 
we have been and believe that we will continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers  including most of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel suppliers  to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from worldspan  lp and to significantly reduce or eliminate their distribution costs 
we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability  primarily from our leisure travel business  to continue to promote the priceline 
com brand and  over time  to offer other travel services and further expand into international markets 
factors beyond our control  such as the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease  natural disasters such as hurricanes  tsunamis or earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere  or the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy  the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or the consolidation of our major airline suppliers or hotel supplier  could adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion  technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results 
we also intend to broaden the scope of our business  and to that end  we explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of  among other things  mergers and acquisitions 
our goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability 
the uncertain environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult  and accordingly  we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability 
seasonality prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers  substantially all of our business was conducted under the name your own price system and accordingly  because those services are non refundable in nature  we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking was generated 
we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service  however  including our european operations  at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel 
as a result  we have seen and expect to continue to see  that a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year  as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations  will not be recognized until future quarters 
from a cost perspective  however  we expense all of our advertising activities as they are incurred  which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are generated 
therefore  as our retail hotel business continues to grow  we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the items described below 
those estimates are based on  among other things  historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management  including the following merchant revenues and merchant cost of revenues name your own price services merchant revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for  among other things  collecting receipts from our customers  remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of the services we offer 
we recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer s non refundable offer 
merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost  respectively  of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis 
pursuant to the terms of our hotel service  our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time 
in the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified time period  we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts 
merchant price disclosed hotel service merchant revenues for our merchant price disclosed hotel service are derived from transactions where customers use our service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements 
charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included in deferred merchant bookings until the customer completes his or her stay 
such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay  subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases 
merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer s stay at the hotel 
we record the difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue 
agency revenues and cost of revenues 
agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties 
agency revenues include travel commissions  customer processing fees and worldspan  lp reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received  without any associated cost of revenue 
such revenues are recognized at the conclusion of the customer s travel 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of the commission receivable 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
management concluded in the third quarter  based upon its assessment of positive and negative evidence  that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash tax benefit in the third quarter of million  resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  a valuation allowance against those assets remains 
the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change  causing a reassessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets 
accounting for state and local hotel occupancy taxes 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against us alleging  among other things  that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room 
historically  we have not collected taxes on this differential 
additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes  either retroactively or prospectively  or both 
to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline 
com service  we might have additional tax exposures 
we will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures  and to the extent appropriate  we will reserve for those estimated liabilities 
airline debit memos 
our airline suppliers periodically send us debit memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost of airline tickets we sold on their behalf 
we process the debit memos received and  when appropriate  make payments to the airlines 
based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines  we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these claims 
allowance for credit card charge backs 
because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions  we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers 
additionally  we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record 
accordingly  we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs 
refunds 
in limited circumstances  we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers to satisfy disputes and complaints 
based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers  we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from these accommodations 
valuation of goodwill 
we have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including bookings  active hotels  travelweb and priceline 
com europe ltd 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques 
in the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates  we could determine that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable 
the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategies  market conditions  or the manner of use of an asset  under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results  and negative industry or economic trends 
in evaluating an asset for possible impairment  management estimates that asset s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable 
if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable  we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life 
equity investments 
we have  among other investments  a equity interest in pricelinemortgage 
com and  accordingly  recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage 
com s operating results  not to exceed an amount that we believe represents the investment s estimated fair value 
the carrying value of the investment at december  was million 
we periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates 
in the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates  we could determine that some part or all of the carrying value of pricelinemortgage 
com is impaired requiring an impairment charge to be recorded 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating metrics our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel services 
specifically  sales of airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our customers 
gross bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased by our customers 
the number of airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows year ended airline tickets hotel room nights rental car days gross bookings december  million million million  million december  million million million  million airline tickets sold decreased by for the twelve months ended december   over the same period in the decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily attributable to a significant percentage decrease in the sale of name your own price airline tickets  largely offset by an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets 
hotel room nights sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   over the same period in the increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the inclusion of hotel room nights sold through our european operations  which are substantially comprised of active hotels and bookings  which were acquired in the third quarters of and  respectively  and our merchant price disclosed hotel service  which was integrated after our acquisition of travelweb during the second quarter this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of name your own price hotel room nights  in part due to the increased focus on our website of our merchant price disclosed hotel service 
rental car days sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   over the same period in due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service  increases in sales of our retail rental car service  which was launched in the fourth quarter of  and the launch of new features  including options for one way destination and off airport car rentals 
gross bookings increased by for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by an increase of in agency bookings for the twelve months ended december   which was primarily attributable to the inclusion of approximately million of gross bookings from our european operations  the increased sale of retail airline tickets  the inclusion of agency gross bookings relating to our retail hotel service launched in march  and the increased sale of retail rental cars 
merchant gross bookings increased by for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant price disclosed hotel bookings  mostly offset by a decrease in the sale of opaque airline tickets 
revenues we classify our revenue into three categories merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for  among other things  collecting receipts from our customers  remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of the services we offer 
merchant revenues include transaction revenues representing the selling price of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms  rental cars and price disclosed vacation packages  transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer  less the amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price disclosed hotel service  customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of name your own price airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price disclosed hotels  and ancillary fees  including worldspan  lp reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions 
agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third parties 
agency revenues include travel commissions  customer processing fees and worldspan  lp reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net amounts received  without any associated cost of revenue 
other revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites 
we continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant opaque name your own price travel services to a business that includes the sale of retail  price disclosed travel services 
because merchant name your own price travel services are reported on a gross basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a net basis  revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and  consequently  gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business 
additionally  our european operations contributed approximately million to our revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues generated by our european operations are primarily recorded on a net basis 
year ended december  change merchant revenues agency revenues other revenues total revenues merchant revenues merchant revenue for the twelve months ended december  decreased by  compared to the same period in due to a substantial percentage decrease in the sale of name your own price airline tickets  which was partially offset by an increase in merchant price disclosed hotel bookings 
we believe that the decrease in the number of name your own price airline tickets sold continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our name your own price airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates  or from low cost carriers  without having to make any trade offs 
agency revenues agency revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of approximately million of agency revenue for the twelve months ended december   from our european operations  and increased sales of retail airline tickets  hotels and rental cars  partially offset by a decrease in worldspan  lp gds fees

cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased by  compared to the same period in  due primarily to a decrease in overall merchant revenues 
merchant price disclosed hotel revenues are recorded at their net amounts  which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers and therefore  there are no associated costs of merchant price disclosed hotel revenues 
cost of agency revenues agency revenues are recorded at their net amount  which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers  if any  and therefore  there are no costs of agency revenues

gross profit total gross profit for the twelve months ended december  increased by compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of increased revenue from the inclusion of results from our european operations which consist of a full year of operations from active hotels which was acquired in september  and approximately six months of operations from bookings  which was acquired in july  and increased sales of retail travel services 
total gross margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue increased during the twelve month period ended december   compared to the same period in  because name your own price transactions  whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue  represented a smaller percentage of transactions compared to agency and merchant price disclosed transactions which are primarily recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues

restructuring charge reversal year ended december  change restructuring charge reversal nm in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  comprised of a million charge based upon a re evaluation of the estimated costs related to leased property originally vacated in  partly offset by a million reversal based upon a re evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain european restructuring activities 
interest year ended december  change interest income interest expense total for the twelve months ended december   interest income on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in  primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates 
interest expense increased for the twelve months ended december  over the same period in because our convertible senior notes issued in june were outstanding for the entire twelve month period in taxes for the twelve months ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this principally resulted from a non cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of of million  relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
the non cash tax benefit was recorded pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize all or some portion of its deferred tax assets 
due to our significant net operating loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our us federal taxable income for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the reversal  we recorded a mostly non cash million provision for us income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in  and will continue to record a non cash provision for us income tax expense in future periods 
this non cash us income tax provision will materially negatively impact net income and earnings per share in subsequent periods as compared to prior periods

the growth in each period was partially offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales of opaque airline tickets sold in each period 
see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview trends above 
hotel room nights sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was driven by the continued success of our opaque hotel service  which benefited from continued direct advertising support and the inclusion of hotel room nights sold by travelweb and active hotels during the respective periods in  subsequent to their acquisitions 
rental car days sold increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service through priceline 
com and our retail rental car service through priceline 
com  rentalcars 
com and breezenet 
com 
gross bookings increased by for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was driven primarily by a increase in agency bookings in as a result of the introduction of retail choice to our airline service and the inclusion of approximately million of bookings from active hotels in our results 
gross bookings also increased as a result of an increase in merchant bookings in  as a result of the continued success of our opaque hotel  rental car and vacation package services which offset significant annualized declines in bookings of our opaque airline ticket service  and the inclusion of approximately million of bookings from travelweb in our results

in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the trade offs associated with our name your own price airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel services at the lower retail rates  or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs

cash equivalents and short term investments are primarily comprised of highly liquid  high quality  investment grade debt instruments 
all of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date 
we therefore tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk 
the objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement  cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators  discussions with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future rates 
we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face 
our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year ended december  based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at december   we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future 
as of december   the carrying value of our debt is approximately million 
we estimate that the fair market value of such debt was approximately million as of december  as of december   we held an interest rate swap agreement on million notional value of our fixed rate debt 
the fair value cost to terminate this swap as of december  was approximately million 
a adverse fluctuation in the month libor rate as of december   would increase the cost to terminate the interest rate swap by approximately  any increase or decrease in the fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
as a result of our acquisitions of our european operations  we are conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our results in us dollars 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the results of operations of our european operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our european operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  the translation of these foreign currency denominated balances will result in increased net assets  net revenues  operating expenses  and net income or loss 
similarly  our net assets  net revenues  operating expenses  and net income or loss will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against local currency 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
our european operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
in  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results 
as of december   there were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
we may enter into additional forward contracts or other economic hedges in the future 
additionally  fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains and losses due to interest rate volatility 
to the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions  priceline 
com would also be affected by such changes
