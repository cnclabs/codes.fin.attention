item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the three years ended dec 
 references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of northwest natural gas company  a regulated utility  and its non regulated businesses  including its wholly owned subsidiary business  nng financial corporation financial corporation 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated gas distribution business  and the term non utility is used to describe our interstate gas storage business interstate gas storage and other non regulated activities other see note 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this report to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
executive summary our strategy in was to remain focused on profitably growing our regulated utility and interstate gas storage businesses 
the utility is our largest business segment with approximately percent of consolidated total assets and percent of consolidated net income in factors critical to the success of the utility include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring natural gas supplies and providing distribution services at a competitive price  and being able to recover the operating and capital costs of the utility in the rates charged to customers 
the utility is regulated by two state commissions  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
the interstate gas storage segment represents approximately percent of consolidated total assets and percent of consolidated net income in this business provides services to large interstate customers using storage and transportation capacity and asset optimization services provided under an agreement with an independent energy marketing company 
factors critical to the success of our interstate gas storage business include the ability to develop additional storage capacity at competitive market prices and to plan for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve its core residential  commercial and industrial firm customers in the future 
highlights of include a percent increase in earnings per share  driven by a percent increase in net income from the utility and a percent increase in net income from interstate gas storage  an percent increase in utility net operating revenues utility margin  reflecting increases from all customer sectors residential  commercial and industrial  over million of utility gas cost savings realized from our financial gas hedging program  including million in the fourth quarter  which helped to partially offset a dramatic rise in gas prices following the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in august and september  
table of contents a net increase of  utility customers  for an annual growth rate in excess of percent for the th consecutive year  expansion of our mist storage facility  enhancing our ability to serve the interstate market  a percent increase in the indicated annual dividend rate per share  making this the th consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders  refinanced a million credit line at attractive rates  providing sufficient liquidity to address higher gas prices  issued million of long term debt  using the proceeds to redeem higher priced debt and fund capital expenditures  received regulatory approval of the utility s conservation tariff  extending the margin stabilization mechanism for another four years  and updated our strategic plan  focusing on cost controls and efficiency improvements 
issues  challenges and performance measures there are a number of factors that affect our operations and financial performance 
the most significant issue the utility faces in the near term is higher gas prices 
wholesale gas prices over the past few years have increased significantly  primarily due to increasing demand 
in  the gas supply market tightened as hurricanes hit parts of the united states  resulting in the disruption of gas supplies and causing gas prices to spike 
although gas prices moderated in early  we expect prices to remain higher than in the past few years 
higher gas prices are already reflected in our customers bills for the heating season 
we believe we have sufficient supplies of natural gas under contract to meet the needs of our firm customers  but further price increases could change our competitive advantage and our customers preference for natural gas 
if higher gas prices persist  it could significantly affect our ability to add residential and commercial customers and could result in industrial customers shifting their businesses energy needs to alternative fuel sources 
other issues and challenges we expect to face in include unpredictable weather conditions  the potential impact of adverse regulatory actions or policy changes  managing gas supplies  storage and transportation capacity  managing customer growth  maintaining a competitive advantage over alternative fuels  managing environmental risks and exposures and higher interest rates 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other risks  see item a risk factors  above  and forward looking statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 
our strategic plan addresses the risks affecting our business by focusing on improving our ability to add customers profitably  maintaining our reputation for exemplary customer service  reducing business risks  managing all costs  including capital expenditures  setting high performance standards for all employees  and judiciously growing beyond our local distribution business where such growth would complement core assets and competencies 
return on equity and common equity ratios are key indicators of our operating performance and financial condition 
we compare our utility return on equity results each year against the return on equity authorized by the opuc 
we also compare our consolidated return on equity results against a peer group of local gas distribution companies because it is necessary for us to attract investors so that we can continue to raise the capital needed to run our businesses 
other key performance measures we use in monitoring progress against our goals include earnings per share  
table of contents customer satisfaction ratings  customer additions  operations and maintenance expense per customer  construction cost per meter installed  and non revenue producing capital expenditures per customer 
earnings and dividends earnings applicable to common stock were million  or a diluted share  for the year ended dec 
  compared to million  or a share  and million  or a share  for the years ended dec 
 and  respectively 
returns on equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to positive factors contributing to increased earnings included increased utility volumes and margins utility net operating revenues from sales to residential and commercial customers due to percent customer growth  percent colder weather and conservation tariff mechanisms  partially offset by declining average use per customer and a decrease in the contribution from the weather normalization mechanism million see results of operations comparison of gas distribution operations  below  and results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below  decreased utility volumes but increased utility margin from industrial customers  primarily reflecting a shift of several customers to higher margin service which offset the overall decline in volumes million  increased utility margin from miscellaneous revenues million  and increased interstate gas storage margin over the prior year primarily due to increased storage services under contract and optimization million 
partially offsetting the above positive factors were increased operations and maintenance expense related to increased payroll and employee benefit costs million  increased damages to company property million  industrial customer settlement charges million and employee severance charges million  increased property tax and depreciation expenses related to increased utility plant in service million  which were partially covered by revenue increases approved in the most recent general rate cases in oregon and washington  and increased income tax expense related to higher net income million 
compared to positive factors contributing to increased earnings included increased contribution to utility margin from residential and commercial customers primarily resulting from the oregon and washington general rate increases  including rate increases for certain capital investments and a full year effect of the weather normalization mechanism million  and increased utility margin contribution from industrial customers resulting from a recovering economy million 

table of contents partially offsetting the above positive factors were decreased margin from other utility operating revenues due to changes in and amortizations under regulatory deferral mechanisms million  increased payroll and related payroll tax  pension and health care costs primarily due to wage and salary increases and certain benefit cost increases million  internal development costs and external audit fees relating to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of million  increases in depreciation and property taxes due to added utility plant million  decreased margin from interstate gas storage due to less optimization margin reflecting lower volatility in natural gas price differentials million  reduced income from non utility subsidiary investments  including a million charge for the sale of solar electric generating investments million  and increased income taxes million 
dividends paid on common stock were a share in  compared to a share in and a share in the current indicated annual dividend rate is per share 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our most critical estimates or judgments involve regulatory cost recovery  unbilled revenues  derivative instruments  pension assumptions  income taxes and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and to a certain extent set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a purchased gas adjustment pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc 
table of contents and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from or refund to customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 
the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
 which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
we continue to apply sfas no 
in accounting for our regulated utility operations 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for some or all of our regulated business 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of sfas no 
for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at dec 
 and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
see note  industry regulation 
revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when the gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at dec 
 and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to higher gas prices included in customer rates and higher volumes reflecting colder weather  partially offset by decreases in customer usage due to higher prices 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at dec 
 was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
in november  we implemented a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that helps stabilize net operating revenues by adjusting current customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
weather normalization is also included in accrued unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period 

table of contents non utility revenues  derived primarily from interstate storage services  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from optimization of excess storage and transportation capacity are recognized over the life of the contract for guaranteed amounts under the contract  or are recognized as they are earned for amounts above the guaranteed value based on information provided by the independent energy marketing company 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business  we enter into natural gas commodity purchase contracts using physical assets owned or contractually obligated to the utility  including gas storage and pipeline transportation capacity 
prior to  these purchase contracts qualified for the normal purchase and normal sale exception as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 
see interstate gas storage  below  and note 
in  we entered into an agreement providing for natural gas commodity exchange transactions with our optimization partner  which involved exchanging gas purchases originally intended for delivery to utility customers  for an equivalent volume of gas from our optimization partner and received at our city gate 
these exchanges resulted in our gas purchase contracts no longer qualifying for the normal purchase and normal sale exception under sfas no 
and required that they be accounted for as derivative instruments and marked to market based on fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 effective march  the mark to market adjustment at dec 
 resulted in a net unrealized loss of million  which was recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
generally  these physical gas purchases are subject to regulatory deferral  and  as such  any unrealized gain or loss in the fair value is not recognized in current income but is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability pursuant to sfas no 
and included in annual cost of gas in rate changes under our pga tariffs see note 
our estimate of fair value is determined by an internal model based on natural gas index prices that are subject to market volatility and an evaluation of counterparty credit risk see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
as a result of these forward gas purchase contracts being classified as derivatives for accounting purposes  any related financial derivative instruments previously designated as hedge instruments of the underlying physical gas purchase contracts no longer qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
therefore  the corresponding financial derivative contracts are no longer designated as cash flow hedges although they continue to economically hedge the financial risk exposure of the underlying physical gas purchase contracts 
the change from hedge accounting treatment had no income statement effect due to the application of sfas no 
for unrealized gains and losses on hedge contracts expected to be included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
our derivatives policy sets forth guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters 
the policy specifically prohibits the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
these contracts that qualify as derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
generally  these contracts are subject to regulatory deferral  and any change in the fair value is recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to sfas no 
see note 
our estimate of fair value is determined from period to period based on an internal discounted cash flow model using forward prices that are subject to market volatility 
for estimated fair values at dec 
 and  see note 
table of contents the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain on commodity price swap contracts net gain loss on commodity price option contracts subtotal net loss on commodity price swaps related to storage net gain on foreign currency forward purchase contracts total realized gains on commodity and currency contracts realized gains losses from commodity price and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market valuations are not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  which are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions we have two qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering all regular employees with more than one year of service 
these plans are funded through a trust dedicated to providing retiree pension benefits 
we also have several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees 
these non qualified plans are unfunded 
net periodic pension cost nppc and accumulated benefit obligations abo are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of key assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and the expected long term return on plan assets see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below  and note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
net periodic pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains and losses  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the market related valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year net periodic pension cost volatility 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the dec 
 measurement date  we decreased the discount rate assumption from percent to percent  updated the mortality rates to reflect longer life expectancies  included a million contribution in september and an additional million in december  maintained the rate of compensation increase in a range of percent  and maintained the expected long term return on plan assets at percent 

table of contents the benefit obligation at dec 
 increased million due to the change in mortality rates  and million due to the percent change in the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate at dec 
 was determined by developing a spot rate yield curve using the pension plans estimated future benefit payments applied to a portfolio of moody s aa or better rated bonds 
we determine the expected long term rate of return by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections which gives consideration to the asset mix and our target asset allocation 
the annualized returns for the past one year  five year and year periods ended dec 
 were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following reflects the sensitivity of net period pension cost and accumulated benefit obligation to future changes in certain actuarial assumptions thousands  except percent change in assumption impact on nppc impact on abo at dec 
 discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a the impact of a change in net periodic pension cost on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because approximately percent of net periodic pension cost is charged to current operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining percent is capitalized as construction overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by recognizing deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from or refunded to customers in future rates 
at dec 
 and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax bases related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability for the same amounts see note 
we believe that it is reasonable to expect recovery of these regulatory assets through future customer rates 
however  future regulatory changes could require the write off of all or a portion of these regulatory assets should they no longer be probable of recovery in future rates see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation  below 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting 
table of contents for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results  developed in consultation with outside counsel and consultants when appropriate 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the lower end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to our environmental liabilities and related costs  we develop estimates based on currently available information  existing technology and environmental regulations 
we previously received regulatory approval to defer and seek recovery of costs related to certain sites and believe the recovery of any costs not recovered under our general liability insurance policies is probable through the regulatory process see note 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a regulatory asset for the amount expected to be recovered 
we intend to first pursue recovery for these environmental costs from our general liability insurance policies  which  to the extent successful  would require a corresponding reduction in the regulatory asset 
at dec 
  million in environmental costs have been recorded as a regulatory asset  including million of costs paid to date and million accrued for estimated future environmental costs 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  then the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made 
an application for extension of the regulatory approval to defer environmental costs is pending 
results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates  systems of accounts and issuance of securities by the opuc and the wutc 
in  percent of our utility gas deliveries and percent of our utility operating revenues were derived from oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases our most recent general rate increase in oregon  which was effective sept 
  authorized rates designed to produce an roe of percent 
in washington  the wutc approved a general rate increase  which became effective on july   but no specific roe was authorized 
in may  we reached a settlement with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc staff and all intervenors with respect to our rate case filed in january related to our interstate storage services 
the settlement provided for a small net increase in the maximum rates for our interstate storage services operation and new service offerings 
the new maximum rates are designed to 
table of contents reflect updated costs related to development of the mist gas storage facilities since and costs associated with the south mist pipeline extension project 
the new rates were effective july  rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are applied each year under the pga mechanisms in nw natural s tariffs in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the costs of natural gas commodity purchased under contracts with gas producers see comparison of gas distribution operations cost of gas sold  below  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in regulatory asset or liability accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
pursuant to the pga tariffs  rate increases were approved by the opuc  averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and by the wutc  averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  both effective oct 
 in  the opuc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and the wutc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  effective oct 
and nov 
  respectively 
in  the opuc approved pga rate increases averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and the wutc approved pga rate increases averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  both effective on oct 
 the opuc has formalized a process that tests for excess earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings under the pga mechanisms 
the opuc has confirmed our ability to pass through percent of prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this requirement  we are authorized to retain all of our earnings up to a threshold level equal to our authorized roe of percent plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a result of the or earnings test 
nw natural does not expect any amounts to be refunded to customers as a result of the earnings test  which will be reviewed by the opuc during the second quarter of weather normalization 
in november  we implemented a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that is designed to stabilize margins from weather sensitive residential and commercial customers by adjusting current billings based on temperature variances from average weather 
for purposes of calculating the weather normalization adjustment  actual daily temperatures are compared to year average temperatures for each specified day 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers 
as part of the approval for our weather normalization  we were required to provide a report evaluating the first two years of the mechanism in the fall of the report concluded that the weather normalization mechanism provides benefit to both the utility and its customers and was extended through september  with minor changes resulting from the opuc s review 
conservation tariff 
in  the opuc authorized a conservation tariff  which is a mechanism designed to recover lost margin due to changes in residential and commercial customers consumption patterns 
the tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between our earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by our customers  so that we do not have an incentive to discourage customers conservation efforts 

table of contents in august  the opuc approved a four year extension of the conservation tariff  through sept 
  and increased the mechanism s coverage from a partial decoupling of percent of residential and commercial gas usage to a full decoupling of percent 
pipeline integrity cost recovery 
in july  the opuc approved our applications relating to the accounting treatment and full recovery for the cost of the pipeline integrity management program as mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration see financial condition cash flows investing activities 
under the applications as approved  we classify our costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each month period ending june  and recover the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective on october of each year 
the accounting and rate treatment for these costs extends through sept 
  and may be reviewed for potential extension after that date 
service quality measures service quality measure conservation tariff 
as part of the initial proceeding approving the conservation tariff  we agreed to adopt certain service quality measures that establish a performance goal for the number of complaints by customers where we are determined to be at fault 
if we exceed the prescribed level of at fault complaints  we are subject to penalties 
since inception  we have not incurred any penalties under these service quality measures 
oregon billing service quality measure 
in  the opuc approved a billing service quality measure for oregon customers that requires billing accuracy  after certain exclusions  of percent each month 
if billing accuracy falls below percent  a remedy of  per month may be imposed  up to a maximum of million per year 
the quality measure became effective jan 
 we do not expect the billing service quality measure to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
utility regulation legislation in  the oregon legislature passed senate bill sb requiring the opuc to establish an annual tax adjustment to ensure that oregon utilities do not collect more income taxes in rates than they actually pay to government entities 
sb is effective for taxes collected on or after jan 
 the bill  which was signed into law on sept 
  requires that the opuc interpret the bill s provisions to determine how the tax adjustment will be applied 
the opuc has issued temporary rules and  in october  we filed with the opuc our first three year tax report showing the amount of taxes we paid according to the definitions in sb compared with the amount of taxes we were authorized to collect in rates for each of the calendar years  and our report concluded that  based on the calculations required by the temporary rules  we paid more in income taxes than the amount we were authorized to collect in rates 
this report was not required for the purpose of determining rate adjustments  and these results are not necessarily indicative of future calculations 
the report  as well as reports submitted by other utilities  is intended to help the opuc develop rules required to implement sb due to the uncertainties related to the opuc s interpretations and rule making with respect to the application of the legislation s provisions  we are not able to determine at this time what impact  if any  the new legislation will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  but the impact may be material 

table of contents comparison of gas distribution operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec

in prior years  customer margin by category did not reflect these costs but have been revised to be consistent with the current year s presentation 
we believe the current presentation is a better representation of the margin earned from each class of customer 

table of contents total utility volumes sold and delivered in increased percent compared to  and volumes sold and delivered in increased percent compared to our customer base continued to grow in  with a net increase of  customers 
the growth rate for was percent compared to percent for both and in the three years ended dec 
  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
our utility results are affected by customer growth and by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in  the opuc approved a conservation tariff that adjusts margin up or down based on changes in residential and commercial customer consumption  and in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism that adjusts customer bills  and our margin  based on above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory developments rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
compared to in  weather was percent colder than  which contributed largely to a percent increase in margin from residential and commercial sales 
the weather normalization mechanism reduced margin by million for the year ended dec 
 based on weather that was actually percent warmer than average 
the mechanism contributed million to margin in based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
generally  we would have expected the weather normalization mechanism to contribute a positive margin contribution when temperatures are warmer than average  but in we lost heating volumes and corresponding margin in the latter part of may when temperatures were significantly warmer than average  and these volume and margin losses were not covered by the weather normalization mechanism which ends each year on may the decoupling mechanism contributed million to margin in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga  compared to a contribution of million in other margin adjustments  which include our share of gas cost savings  unaccounted for gas charges and other regulatory gas cost and revenue adjustments  increased margin by million in compared to a decrease of million in the decrease in net deductions from other margin adjustments was primarily due to a higher share of gas cost savings in the current year  which amounted to million in  as compared to million in see cost of gas  below 
compared to in  margin from residential and commercial sales increased percent due to the full year effect of higher rates resulting from the oregon general rate increase effective in september and from the washington general rate increase effective in july  partially offset by weather that was percent warmer than the weather normalization mechanism increased margin by million for the year ended dec 
 based on weather that was percent warmer than average and contributed million to margin in based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
the decoupling mechanism contributed million to margin in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga  compared to a contribution of million in 
table of contents other margin adjustments  which include our share of gas cost savings  unaccounted for gas charges and other regulatory gas cost and revenue adjustments  reduced margin by million in compared to an increase of million in the increase in net deductions from other margin adjustments was primarily due to lower off system gas sales in compared to residential and commercial sales the following table summarizes the utility volumes and utility operating revenues in the residential and commercial markets 
the primary factors that impact the results of operations in these markets are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas

 and oct 
 see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
typically  percent or more of annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income was significantly reduced with the implementation of the weather normalization mechanism in oregon beginning in november see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
this 
table of contents mechanism applies to meter readings of participating oregon customers taken between nov 
and may approximately percent of our residential and commercial customers are in washington  where the mechanism is not in effect  and about percent of the eligible oregon customers elected not to be covered by the mechanism  so the mechanism does not fully insulate us from earnings volatility due to weather 
the mechanism decreased margin by a net million in the twelve month period ended dec 
 in  the mechanism contributed million of margin and in the mechanism contributed million of margin in the two months after becoming effective in november total utility operating revenues include accruals for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers accrued unbilled revenues based on estimates of gas deliveries from that month s meter reading dates to month end 
amounts reported as unbilled operating revenues reflect the increase or decrease in the balance of accrued unbilled revenues compared to the prior year end 
weather conditions  rate changes and customer billing dates affect the balance of accrued unbilled revenue at the end of each month

the higher revenues reflect a percent increase in sales volumes due to customers that migrated from transportation to sales service  where the cost of gas component is included in revenues  and from rate increases approved in the pga  effective oct 
 and oct 
 
table of contents compared to total volumes delivered to industrial customers were million therms  or percent  higher in than in  and operating revenues were up million  or percent 
the higher volumes and revenues partially reflect an improving economy  but results primarily reflect the shift from transportation to sales service and the reclassification of a relatively large number of customers from the commercial category to the industrial category in the months following implementation of the rate design changes in oregon 
the number of industrial customers increased percent from to  reflecting this reclassification 
industrial rates in oregon were redesigned as part of the general rate case in  transferring million of annual revenue requirement from industrial rates to residential and commercial rates in order to better reflect relative costs of service and to improve the competitiveness of our rates in the industrial market 
high natural gas prices resulted in a number of our large industrial customers switching from transportation service  where they arrange for their own supplies through independent third parties  to sales service where we sell the gas commodity under regulatory tariffs 
our tariff requires us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred to serve those customers see note 
other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts other than deferrals relating to gas costs see note

cost of gas sold natural gas commodity prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years 
the effects of higher commodity prices and price volatility on core utility customers are mitigated in part through the use of underground storage facilities  fixed price commodity hedge contracts and short term sales of excess gas commodity and transportation capacity to off system customers in periods when core utility customers do not require the full firm pipeline capacity and gas supplies 
we regularly renew or replace our expiring long term and medium term contracts with agreements with a variety of existing and new suppliers 
except for contract volumes under exchange agreements with our asset optimization partner  no single contract amounts to more than  therms per day or percent of our average daily volumes 
firm year round supply contracts have primary terms currently ranging from less than one year to nine years 
all of the contracts use price formulas tied to monthly index prices  primarily at the nova inventory transfer trading point in canada 
we hedge a majority of our contracts each year using financial instruments as part of our gas purchasing strategy 
the total cost of gas sold was million in  an increase of million or percent compared to  and cost of gas sold in was million or percent higher than the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
we use a natural gas commodity price hedge program under the terms of our derivatives policy to help manage our exposure to floating price gas commodity contracts see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  above  and note 
we realized net financial hedge gains of million from our financial hedges in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
gains and losses from the financial hedging of utility gas purchases are included in cost of gas  which are factored into our pga deferrals and annual rate changes  and therefore have no material impact on net income 

table of contents under the pga tariff in oregon  our net income is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
in each of the last three years  our actual gas costs were lower than the gas costs embedded in rates  with the effect that our share of the cost savings increased margin by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we are able to use gas supplies available but not required for delivery to core market customers  principally due to warmer weather and other changes in gas demand  to make off system sales 
under the pga tariff in oregon  we retain percent of the margins realized from off system sales and record the remaining percent as a deferred regulatory asset or liability for recovery from  or refund to  customers in future rates 
our share of margin from off system gas sales in resulted in a margin gain of million compared to a loss of million in our share of margin from off system gas sales was significantly higher in  at million  reflecting a higher volume of gas available for off system sales due to warmer weather and significantly higher market prices 
we were able to use excess gas supplies available under contract at fixed prices  but not required for delivery to core utility market customers to make these off system sales at higher market prices 
the purchase price for this gas had been fixed through commodity swap and call option contracts entered into earlier at levels substantially below the market prices 
business segments other than local gas distribution interstate gas storage we earned million in net income from our non utility interstate gas storage business segment in  after regulatory sharing and income taxes  equivalent to cents a share  compared to million or cents a share in and million or cents a share in see note 
earnings from this business segment were higher in  primarily due to increased revenues from interstate storage services under contract 
a secondary reason was an increase in net revenues from a contract with an independent energy marketing company the optimization partner that optimizes the value of our gas supply and storage assets 
in oregon  we retain percent of the pre tax income from interstate gas storage services and optimization services when the costs of such storage and pipeline capacity have not been included in utility rates  or retain percent of the pre tax income from such optimization when the capacity costs have been included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for refund to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from interstate storage services and third party optimization services 
subsidiaries financial corporation financial corporation s operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the decrease in net income in and compared to was primarily due to the write down and sale of our limited partnership interests in three solar electric generation projects  and the payment of a million cash dividend by financial corporation to the parent company

partially offsetting the above increases was a million decrease in uncollectible accounts expense reflecting improved collection results and cash recoveries of accounts previously written off 
compared to a million increase in payroll and payroll related expenses  due to salary and wage increases  and higher pension and health care costs  resulting from a change in the pension discount rate assumption and rising health care premiums see note  a million increase in expenses for compliance activities  including external audit fees  relating to the sarbanes oxley act of  a million increase in uncollectible accounts expense due to increases in gross revenues stemming from higher rates  and a million increase in gas technology research costs

table of contents other income and expense net was million lower in compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower gains from company owned life insurance million  reflecting the liquidation of million in cash surrender value of policies in  and the absence of the equity component of allowance for funds used during construction million reflecting lower construction work in progress balances 
other income and expense net improved by million in over the increase was primarily due to reductions in interest charges on deferred regulatory account balances million  reflecting lower net credit balances outstanding in these accounts 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in gains from company owned life insurance million due to decreases in the market value of equity based life insurance investments 
interest charges net of amounts capitalized interest charges net of amounts capitalized in was million  or percent  higher than in  reflecting higher balances of long term debt outstanding during the period due to the issuance of million in june  and higher interest rates on short term debt

 short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of commercial paper notes  which are supported by committed bank lines of credit 
we have available through sept 
 committed bank lines totaling million with five commercial banks see lines of credit  below  and note 
short term debt balances typically are reduced toward the end of the winter heating season as a significant amount of our current assets  primarily accounts receivable and gas inventories  are converted into cash 
capital expenditures primarily relate to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements see cash flows investing activities  below 
certain contractual commitments under capital leases  operating leases  gas supply purchase contracts and other contracts require an adequate source of funding 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
to provide long term financing  we periodically issue and sell secured debt  unsecured debt  preferred stock or common stock 
in april  we issued million of common stock and in june we issued million of secured medium term notes  leaving million available for future issuance  which has previously been approved by the opuc see financing activities  below 
neither our mortgage and deed of trust nor the indenture under which other long term debt may be issued contain credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for agreements with certain counterparties under our derivatives policy  which may require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letter of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade  or in some cases if the mark to market value exceeds a certain threshold 

table of contents based on the availability of short term credit facilities and our expectation of being able to issue long term debt and equity securities  we believe there is sufficient liquidity to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements  including the contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 
dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock in each year since the stock first was issued to the public in annual common dividend payments have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
it is the intention of the board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on common stock on a quarterly basis 
however  future dividends will be dependent upon our earnings  our financial condition and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements except for certain lease and purchase commitments see contractual obligations  below  we have no material off balance sheet financing arrangements

these and other contractual obligations are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would require repurchases of up to million of principal amounts in each of  and if repurchased prior to maturity  then the interest obligation shown in the above table would be reduced in future years

 approved a labor agreement joint accord covering wages  benefits and working conditions that will expire on may  commercial paper our primary source of short term funds is from the sale of commercial paper notes 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet seasonal working capital requirements  including the financing of gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may also be used to temporarily fund capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our commercial paper program is supported by committed bank lines of credit see lines of credit  below 
we had million in commercial paper notes outstanding at dec

 lines of credit in september  we entered into agreements for unsecured lines of credit totaling million with five commercial banks  replacing the previous million credit facilities 
the new bank lines of credit are available and committed for a term of five years from oct 
 to sept 
 our bank lines are used primarily as back up support for the notes payable under our commercial paper borrowing program 
commercial paper provides the liquidity to meet our working capital and external financing requirements 
under the terms of these bank lines  we pay upfront fees and annual commitment fees but are not required to maintain compensating bank balances 
the interest rates on outstanding loans  if any  under these bank lines are based on then current market interest rates 
all principal and unpaid interest under the bank lines is due and payable on sept 
 the bank lines require that we maintain credit ratings with standard poor s rating services s p and moody s investors service moody s and notify the banks of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our credit rating is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating a condition of drawing upon the bank lines 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under these bank lines are tied to credit ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the bank lines when ratings are changed 
the bank lines also require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the banks to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at dec

cash flows operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily affected by net income  changes in working capital requirements and other cash and non cash adjustments to operating results 
in  the cash flow from net income and operating activity adjustments  excluding working capital changes  decreased by million  primarily due to a decrease in deferred income tax benefits reflecting the expiration of higher tax benefits realized in from accelerated bonus depreciation and an increase in cash contributions to qualified pension plans  partially offset by an increase in net income and cash from deferred gas costs 
in  net income and operating activity adjustments  excluding working capital changes  increased cash flow by million  but the cash flow increase was offset by increases in working capital requirements within the utility segment resulting from warmer weather  higher prices of natural gas  and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries

the annual pension cost or income is allocated between operations and maintenance expense and construction overhead 
net periodic pension cost for our two qualified defined benefit pension plans totaled million in  an increase of million over net periodic pension cost for these plans of million in the increased net periodic pension cost was primarily due to a lower discount rate percent in compared to percent in  partially offset by earnings on additional cash contributions to the plans 
we make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarial assumptions and estimates  tax regulations and funding requirements under federal law 
generally  it is our policy to contribute at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of it is also our intent to contribute additional amounts as are sufficient on an actuarial basis to maintain funding targets and provide for the payment of future benefits under the plans 
during  we contributed million to our two qualified defined benefit plans 
although we were not required to make additional cash contributions in based on minimum funding requirements  we contributed million in september and an additional million in december based on increases in the benefit obligations 
during  we contributed million  of which million represented the minimum required funding 
the fair market value of the two plans assets increased to million at dec 
  up from million at dec 
 the increase included million in investment gains and employer contributions of million  which were offset in part by million in withdrawals to pay benefits and million in eligible expenses of the two plans 
the present value of benefit obligations under the two plans increased from an estimated million to million during  reflecting the adoption of new mortality assumptions for the plans and the lower discount rate referred to above 
the two qualified deferred benefit pension plans were under funded in aggregate by approximately million at dec 
 net periodic pension cost for the plans was million in  compared to million in the increased net periodic pension cost in was primarily due to the use of a

the present value of benefit obligations under the two plans increased from an estimated million to million during the two plans were under funded in aggregate by about million at dec 
 despite the increase in net periodic pension cost and the current under funded status of the plans  we believe the plans to be well funded and that we will be able to continue to maintain appropriate funding levels 
we do not expect our current or future cash contribution requirements to the two plans to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition see note

industrial customers switching from transportation to sales service high natural gas prices in the third quarter of resulted in some of the utility s large industrial transportation customers electing to receive gas commodity under sales service instead of arranging for their own supplies through independent third parties 
since these customers were electing to transfer to sales service after commodity rates were set in the annual pga  the relevant tariff required us to charge these customers the incremental cost of gas supply incurred to serve them 
in october  we notified these customers that they would be charged incremental gas supply costs 
certain of these customers notified us that they expected to be charged gas costs at our weighted average cost of gas price 
we have worked with the opuc  wutc and these industrial customers to reach settlements and have resolved the matter with all but one of the customers 
we filed the settlement agreements with the opuc and wutc

the administrative law judge has postponed all further action in the investigation until a ruling on our motion 
on jan 
  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in multnomah county  oregon  against georgia pacific corporation seeking a declaration  among other things  that the utility and georgia pacific are bound by the terms of the tariff 
on feb 
  georgia pacific filed a complaint against us in the united states district court alleging breach of contract  duty of good faith and fair dealing  promissory estoppel  fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of certain oregon statutes 
when georgia pacific responded by filing the federal lawsuit described above  and removing the declaratory judgment suit to federal court on feb 
  we voluntarily dismissed our suit for declaratory judgment in state court  and now all matters between the parties are before the federal court 
we will vigorously contest the claims asserted by georgia pacific 
we do not expect the final outcome of this litigation to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  weather risk  and interest rate risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into short term  medium term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated short  medium and long term transportation capacity contracts 
historically  we have taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in our natural gas supply contracts 
these contracts are primarily index based and subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
our pga mechanisms in oregon and washington provide for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  we absorb percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retain percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
market risks related to potential adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or counterparty credit quality in relation to these financial and physical contracts are discussed below 
commodity price risk natural gas commodity prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price swap and call option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing  subject to a prudency review 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under these commodity swap and call option contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
at dec 
  five of these financial hedge contracts have 
table of contents maturities in and one contract has a maturity in if all of the commodity price swap and call option contracts had been settled on dec 
  a regulatory gain of million would have been realized and deferred see note 
we monitor the liquidity of our financial derivative contracts 
based on the existing open interest in the contracts held  we believe existing contracts to be liquid 
all of our financial derivative contracts settle within the next three years 
the million unrealized gain is an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to be realized as follows million in  million in and million in the amount realized will change based on market prices at the time contract settlements are fixed 
commodity supply risk with unaffiliated energy marketing company in the first quarter of  we entered into a series of exchange transactions with an unaffiliated energy marketing company which resulted in our accounting for forward gas purchase contracts as derivative instruments under sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the mark to market adjustment at dec 
 is an unrealized loss of million which is recorded as a liability with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset account based on regulatory deferral accounting treatment under sfas no 
prior to the first quarter of  our forward gas supply contracts were excluded from the provisions of sfas no 
under the normal purchase and normal sale exception that is allowed for contracts that are probable of delivery in the normal course of business 
these exchange transactions are intended and designed to reduce commodity prices  with the derivatives decreasing our net exposures to market risk 
these derivatives are used for managing business risks and not for trading purposes 
in the exchange transactions referred to above  we continue to receive the same quantities of physical deliveries of natural gas volumes at the entry point into our distribution system  while the unaffiliated energy marketing company seeks to use the equivalent physical commodity volumes at an upstream delivery point 
under the optimization agreement with this company  we receive a fixed fee plus a share of any gains above the fixed fee 
our exchange transaction is consistent with our policies on physical gas purchases and derivative instruments  which govern the use of commodity supply contracts and financial derivatives in order to manage our commodity supply and related price risk 
these policies provide for the use of only those contracts  volumes and instrument types that are needed in the normal course of business  that help to manage gas supply costs and that have a close volume or price correlation to our assets  liabilities or forecasted transactions  thereby ensuring that such instruments will be used for hedging business risks and not for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to the purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of dec 
  no foreign currency forward contracts extended beyond dec 
 if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on dec 
  a gain of million would have been realized see note 

table of contents credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers  with no single supplier accounting for more than percent of our total purchases for a given monthly period 
we evaluate suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value  our credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties relating to commodity swap and call option contracts was million at dec 
 our derivatives policy requires counterparties to have a minimum credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and the policy specifies limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
there were no credit rating downgrades for any of our counterparties during the following table summarizes our credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of s p or moody s rating  or a middle rating if the entity is split rated more than one rating level financial derivative exposure by credit rating unrealized fair value gain thousands dec

 aa aa bbb baa total credit exposure to customers 
increases in the market price of natural gas are expected to increase our credit exposure to customers 
also  higher prices have resulted in some of our largest industrial customers changing from transportation service to sales service 
under transportation service  the customer is purchasing its commodity supplies from an independent third party  with the utility only providing the transportation service for delivery of that gas to the customer s premise 
under sales service  the customer is purchasing both its gas commodity supply and transportation service from us 
with higher natural gas commodity prices  our credit exposure to large industrial sales customers is expected to increase significantly 
we monitor and manage the credit exposure of our industrial sales customers through credit policies and procedures  which are designed to reduce credit risk 
these policies and procedures include an ongoing review of credit risks  including changes in the services provided to industrial customers as well as changes in market conditions and customers credit quality 
changes in credit risk may require us to obtain additional assurance  such as deposits  letters of credit  guarantees and prepayments to reduce our credit exposure 

table of contents we also monitor and manage the credit exposure of our residential and commercial customers 
this credit risk is largely mitigated by the nature of our regulated business and reasonably short collection terms  as well as by the consistent application of credit policies and procedures 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between nov 
through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of dec 
  about percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and  if permitted  the reduction of debt through optional redemption when interest rates are favorable 
at dec 
 and  we had no variable rate long term debt and no derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rates 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate maturities by million in each of  and forward looking statements this report and other presentations made by us from time to time may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended
