receivables  net of allowances at november   accounts receivable  net of allowances  were million 
net receivables were determined based upon the company s evaluation of known requirements  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
amounts associated with potential return of products as well as customer chargebacks  net of expected recoveries  are reflected in net accounts receivable 
these types of allowances are reflected as a reduction of sales upon the determination that such allowances can be reasonably estimated and are probable 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales of apparel at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
the potential additional allowance that would be required 
table of contents arising from the above described possible adverse economic conditions cannot be quantified with precision 
if an additional allowance of of gross receivables was necessary  an additional provision of approximately million would result  which would reduce total assets at november  by approximately 
and earnings before income taxes by approximately 
inventory valuation at november   inventories were million  and reflected the lifo valuation method for certain work in process and finished goods  as well as reductions from cost when required in order to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the lower of cost or market valuation considers the estimated realizable value in the current economic environment associated with disposing of surplus inventories 
additional downward valuation adjustments could be required should the current economic climate significantly worsen  resulting in retailers being unwilling to accept deliveries of advance orders placed or the company electing not to ship inventories to those retailers where additional credit risk is not deemed appropriate  or if a significant contraction were to occur in demand for the company s in stock replenishment business for selected product categories 
the potential additional downward valuation adjustments could result from unanticipated additional excess quantities of finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
the potential additional reserve that would be required arising from the above described possible adverse economic conditions cannot be quantified with precision 
if an additional allowance of of gross inventories was necessary  an additional provision of approximately million would result  which would reduce total assets at november  by approximately 
and earnings before income taxes by approximately 
deferred tax assets at november   the accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflected million of deferred tax assets  a majority of which related to expected utilization of available tax operating loss carryforwards 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company had approximately million of federal tax operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  of which approximately million expire in the period and million will expire in in general  such carryforwards must be utilized within years of incurring the net operating loss within years with respect to the tax loss incurred in 
at november   the company concluded that it is more likely than not that there would be sufficient taxable earnings to fully utilize the operating loss carryforwards and no tax valuation allowance was required 
a tax valuation reserve could be required in whole or in part in the future should the company s actual earnings or prospective earnings decrease the likelihood that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated to fully utilize the available carryforwards 
fully utilizing the million available operating loss carryforwards expiring by the end of fiscal will require average annual taxable earnings of approximately million over the period 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized  but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise 
impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and earnings in the future  discounted by the company s weighted average cost of capital 
impairment tests were performed by the company in the second quarter of and this evaluation indicated that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment adjustments were required

as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company allocated the purchase price of the july misook acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values considering a number of factors including the assistance of an independent third party appraisal 
the fair value allocated to the tradename  which was deemed to have an indefinite life and which is not being amortized  was million 
the tradename was valued using an income approach considering the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies 
the estimated 
table of contents remaining useful life was determined to be indefinite based on the current expectation to continue to use and promote the tradename indefinitely and the lack of any legal or economic constraint associated with the tradename 
similar methodologies were utilized to establish the fair value of intangibles associated with the acquisition of simply blue which also included the assistance of an independent third party appraisal  which  among other things  established a fair value of million attributable to tradenames having an indefinite life 
should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets is associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years  some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment 
based on achieving historical operating margins  if the current estimate of revenues used in the cash flow projections for cag declined by to or the assumed cost of capital was increased by approximately basis points  an impairment of goodwill for cag could be required 
the value assigned to the misook tradename and the tradenames acquired in the simply blue acquisition could be subject to possible impairment to the extent that the brands were to experience significant future declines in demand resulting from such factors as consumer spending for apparel and retailers expectations of future apparel product sales
