item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provides you with a narrative on our financial results 
it contains a discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each segment of our business  followed by a discussion and analysis of our financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to your reading of our discussion and analysis include the following a description of our business strategy found in items and business and properties business strategy  a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties recent developments  and a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in item a risk factors 
we begin with a discussion of our critical accounting polices and estimates  those areas that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed following 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
in december  after a thorough review of any potential environmental issues that could impact our assets or operations and of our need to correctly record all related environmental contingencies  we recognized a million increase in environmental expense associated with environmental liability adjustments 
the million expense item resulted from the necessity of properly adjusting our environmental expenses and accrued liabilities between our reportable business segments  primarily affecting our products pipelines and our terminals business segments 
the million increase in environmental expense resulted in a million increase in expense to our products pipelines business segment  a million increase in expense to our terminals business segment  a million increase in expense to our co business segment  and a million decrease in expense to our natural gas pipelines business segment 
the adjustment included an million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables and a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities 
we included the additional million expense within operations and maintenance in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for similarly  in december  we recognized a million increase in environmental expenses and an associated million increase in deferred income tax expense resulting from changes to previous estimates 
the million expense item  including taxes  resulted from the necessity of properly adjusting our environmental expenses  liabilities and receivables between our four reportable business segments 
it is the net impact of a million increase in expense in our products pipelines business segment  a million decrease in expense in our natural gas pipelines business segment  a million decrease in expense in our co business segment  and an million decrease in expense in our terminals business segment 
the adjustment included an million increase in our estimated environmental receivables and reimbursables and a million increase in our overall accrued environmental and related claim liabilities 
we included the additional million environmental expense within other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we expense legal costs as incurred  and all recorded legal liabilities are revised as better information becomes available 
sfpp  lp is the subsidiary limited partnership that owns our pacific operations pipelines  excluding calnev pipe line llc 
tariffs charged by our pacific operations pipeline systems are subject to certain proceedings at the ferc involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints and could  therefore owe reparations and or refunds to complainants as mandated by ferc or the united states judicial system 
we recorded an accrual of million for an expense attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability  and we included this amount within operations and maintenance in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the factors we considered when making this additional accrual included i the opinions and views of our legal counsel  ii our experience with reparations and refunds previously paid to complainants and other shippers as required by ferc in  we paid transportation rate reparation and refund payments in the amount of million as mandated by the ferc  and iii the decision of our management as to how we intend to respond to the complaints  which includes the compliance filing we submitted to the ferc on march  we estimated  as of december   that shippers claims for reparations totaled approximately million and that prospective rate reductions would have an aggregate average annual impact of approximately million  with the reparations amount and interest increasing as the timing for implementation of rate reductions and the payment of reparations has extended estimated at a quarterly increase of approximately million 
based on the december  order  rate reductions will be implemented on may  we now assume that reparations and accrued interest thereon will be paid no earlier than the first quarter of  however  the timing  and nature  of any rate reductions and reparations that may be ordered will likely be affected by the final disposition of the application of the ferc s new policy statement on income tax allowances to our pacific operations in the ferc docket nos 
or and or proceedings 
as discussed in the preceding paragraph  we recorded an accrual of million for an expense attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability 
we had previously estimated the combined annual impact of the rate reductions and the payment of reparations sought by shippers would be approximately cents of distributable cash flow per unit 
based on our review of the ferc s december order and the ferc s february order on rehearing  and subject to the ultimate resolution of these issues in our compliance filings and subsequent judicial appeals  we now expect the total annual impact will be less than cents per unit 
the actual  partial year impact on distributable cash flow per unit will likely be closer to cents per unit

intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
we account for our intangible assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and provided that all identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  will not be subject to regular periodic amortization 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we have selected an impairment measurement test date of january of each year  and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  as of january   our goodwill was million 
our remaining intangible assets  excluding goodwill  include lease value  contracts  customer relationships and agreements 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  these intangibles totaled million and million  respectively 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals 
independent oil and gas consultants have reviewed the estimates of proved reserves of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that we have attributed to our net interest in oil and gas properties as of december  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively and negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and floating interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
however  the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex  and even when we engage in hedging transactions that are effective economically  these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes 
accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges  even when there is no underlying economic impact at that point 
generally  the financial statement volatility arises from an accounting requirement to recognize changes in values of financial instruments while not concurrently recognizing the values of the underlying transactions being hedged 
in addition  it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to commodity prices 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations 
even when we cannot enter into a completely effective hedge  we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all 
our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
results of operations our business model is built to support two principal components helping customers by providing energy  bulk commodity and liquid products transportation  storage and distribution  and creating long term value for our unitholders 
to achieve these objectives  we focus on providing fee based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy related pipelines  bulk and liquids terminal facilities  and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves 
our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise  and each of our four segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available

in  we earned net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million  compared to net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in  and net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash consists primarily of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use this measure of profit and loss internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to our business segments 
our total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled  million in   million in  and  million in as noted in the table above  our segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization included charges of million attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability  million from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities  and million related to a natural gas liquids inventory reconciliation on our north system  our segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization included charges of million from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities 
excluding these charges  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization for our four business segments totaled  million in and  million in both the million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the environmental  rate case and inventory charges discussed above  in compared to  and the million increase in compared to  consisted of year to year increases from all four of our business segments  with the strongest growth coming from our co carbon dioxide and natural gas pipelines business segments 
the year over year increases in earnings were attributable both to internal growth and to contributions from acquired assets  more specifically higher earnings from our co segment  where we benefited from higher crude oil and natural gas processing plant liquids production volumes  higher industry price levels for both crude oil and natural gas processing plant liquids products  higher third party carbon dioxide sales  and acquisitions of additional oil reserve interests and related assets  higher earnings from our natural gas pipelines segment  largely due to improved gross margins on natural gas sales activities and higher revenues from natural gas transportation and storage services  higher earnings from our terminals segment  primarily due to higher revenues earned from transporting and storing petroleum  petrochemical related liquids  and dry bulk material products  and to the favorable impact of completed internal expansion projects and acquired terminal operations since the end of  and higher earnings from our products pipelines segment  mainly due to higher revenues from deliveries of refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids  higher revenues from refined product terminal operations  and the acquisition of our southeast terminal operations  which consist of refined petroleum products terminals that were acquired since december we declared a cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of an annualized rate of 
this distribution was higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of  and higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of we expect to declare cash distributions of at least per unit for however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this level of distribution  and our expectation does not take into account any transportation rate reductions or capital costs associated with financing the payment of reparations sought by shippers on our pacific operations interstate pipelines 
our general partner and our common and class b unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives quarterly distributions in additional i units 
the value of the quarterly per share distribution of i units is based on the value of the quarterly per share cash distribution made to our common and class b unitholders

b includes pacific  plantation  north system  calnev  central florida  cypress and heartland pipeline volumes 
our products pipelines segment s primary businesses include transporting refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids through pipelines and operating liquid petroleum products terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix processing facilities 
the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  and referred to above in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters  the segment s and earnings include charges of million and million  respectively  from the adjustment of our environmental liabilities 
as noted in the table and referred to above in critical accounting policies and estimates legal matters  the segment s earnings also includes a charge of million attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability 
finally  as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings includes a charge of million to account for differences between physical and book natural gas liquids inventory on our north system 
this charge was based on an inventory reconciliation of our north system s liquids inventory that was completed in the fourth quarter of excluding these adjustments  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in and million in the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus excluding the above adjustments included an million increase from our southeast product terminal operations 
our southeast terminal operations consist of refined products terminals located in the southeastern united states that we acquired in december  march  and november the overall million year to year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our southeast terminals included incremental earnings of million from the nine refined product terminal operations we acquired in november from charter terminal company and charter triad terminals  llc  the remaining million increase was primarily due to higher product throughput revenues and to the inclusion of a full year of operations from the seven refined product terminal operations we acquired in march from exxon mobil corporation 
other increases to the segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the prior year included a million increase from our pacific operations  a million increase from our calnev pipeline  a million increase from our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company  and a million increase from our central florida pipeline 
the increases from our combined pacific and calnev operations were primarily revenue driven  revenues from refined petroleum product deliveries increased million and terminal service revenues increased million 
the increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to plantation was mainly due to the recognition  in  of incremental interest income of million on our long term note receivable from plantation 
in july  we loaned million to plantation to allow it to pay all of its outstanding credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and in exchange for this funding  we received a seven year note receivable bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
the increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline was mainly due to higher product delivery revenues  resulting from an increase in throughput delivery volumes 
offsetting the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to were decreases in earnings of million from our proportionate interest in the cochin pipeline system  million from our west coast product terminals  million from our petroleum transmix processing operations  and a combined million from our north system and cypress natural gas liquids pipelines 
the decrease from cochin resulted from both lower transportation revenues  due to a drop in delivery volumes caused by extended pipeline testing and repair activities and warmer winter weather  and higher operating expenses  due principally to higher pipeline repair  maintenance and testing costs 
the decrease from our west coast terminals was largely due to higher property tax expenses in  due to expense reversals taken in the second quarter of pursuant to favorable property reassessments  and to lower product revenues resulting from the fourth quarter closure of our gaffey street product terminal located in san pedro  california 
the year to year decrease in earnings from our transmix operations was due to both lower revenues and lower other income 
the decrease in revenues was due to a nearly decrease in processing volumes  largely resulting from the disallowance  beginning in july  of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe blended transmix in the state of illinois 
the decrease in other income was due to a million benefit taken from the reversal of certain short term liabilities in the second quarter of the decrease in earnings from our north system was mainly due to higher product storage expenses  which was related to a new storage contract agreement entered into in april and to higher levels of year end inventory in cypress decrease was driven by lower revenues  the result of a decrease in throughput volumes that was largely due to the third quarter hurricane related closure of a petrochemical plant in lake charles  louisiana that is served by the pipeline 
the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to excluding the environmental charge included incremental earnings of million from the addition of our southeast terminal operations  and a year to year increase in earnings of million from our pacific operations 
for our pacific operations  the increase was primarily due to incremental fees earned from ethanol related blending services  higher refined product delivery revenues  and incremental revenues related to the refined products terminal operations we acquired from shell oil products in october due to environmental and health concerns  the state of california began transitioning from mtbe blended gasoline to ethanol blended gasoline in  and mandated the elimination of mtbe from gasoline by january  ethanol is an alcohol based alternative fuel produced by fermenting and distilling starch crops and can be used to increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline 
however  due to the lack of dedicated pipelines  ethanol cannot be shipped through pipelines but must instead be blended at terminals 
we have  therefore  since  realized some reduction in california gasoline volumes transported by our pacific and calnev pipelines but the conversion from mtbe to ethanol in california has resulted in an increase in ethanol blending services at many of our pacific  calnev and west coast refined petroleum product terminal facilities  and the fees we have earned for ethanol related services at our terminals have more than offset the reduction in pipeline transportation fees 
we also reported  in  increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million from our proportionate ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system  million from our west coast terminal operations  and million from our cypress pipeline 
for our proportionate interest in cochin  the increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization was driven by higher revenues from pipeline throughput deliveries and by an additional ownership interest acquired since the end of effective october   we acquired an additional undivided interest in the cochin pipeline system for approximately million  bringing our total interest to 
for our west coast terminals  the increase in earnings was largely attributable to higher fees from ethanol blending services and from revenue increases across all service activities performed at our carson  california and our connected los angeles harbor product terminals 
the increase in cypress earnings in versus was primarily due to a increase in throughput delivery volumes in  due to improved demand for natural gas liquids driven by higher petrochemical profit margins 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to were partly offset by decreases in earnings of million from our calnev pipeline and million from our north system 
for calnev  the decrease was driven by higher fuel and power expenses  higher operating expenses  and lower other income items 
for the north system  the decrease was primarily due to higher leased storage expenses  due to higher lease fees  and lower transport revenues  related to a decrease in throughput delivery volumes 
the decline in north system delivery volumes was primarily due to a lack of propane supplies in february through april of  caused by shippers reducing line fill and storage volumes to lower levels than in april  we filed a plan with the federal energy regulatory commission to provide a line fill service  which has helped mitigate the supply problems we experienced on our north system in the first half of pursuant to this plan  we purchased million of line fill during revenues for the segment increased million in compared to the increase primarily consisted of a million increase from incremental revenues earned by our southeast terminal operations  including million attributable to the charter terminals we acquired in november  and million attributable to the exxonmobil terminals we acquired in march  a million increase from our pacific operations  a million increase from our calnev pipeline  a million increase from our central florida pipeline  and a million decrease from our investment in the cochin pipeline  as described above 
our pacific operations million increase in revenues in relative to included increases of million from mainline refined product delivery revenues and million from incremental terminal revenues 
the increase from product delivery revenues was driven by a increase in delivery volumes and by increases in average tariff rates 
the higher tariff rates included ferc approved annual indexed interstate tariff increases in july of and producer price index finished goods adjustments  and a filed rate increase on our completed north line expansion with the california public utility commission 
in november  we filed an application with the cpuc requesting a million increase in existing california intrastate transportation rates to reflect the in service date of our million north line expansion project 
pursuant to cpuc regulations  this increase automatically became effective as of december   but is being collected subject to refund  pending resolution of protests to the application by certain shippers 
the year to year increase in revenues from terminal operations was primarily due to increased terminaling and ethanol blending services  as a result of the increase in throughput  and to incremental revenues from diesel lubricity additive injection services that we began offering in may for our calnev pipeline  the million increase in revenues in versus consisted of a million increase from refined product delivery revenues  primarily due to volume growth  and a million increase from terminal operations  due to higher product storage  injection and ethanol blending services 
the year to year increase in central florida s revenues in compared to was due to an increase in transport volumes  partly due to hurricane related pipeline delivery disruptions in the state of florida during the third quarter of including all of the segment s operations  total delivery volumes of refined products  consisting of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel  were up in compared to  with increases on pacific  central florida and calnev offset by a decrease on plantation 
excluding plantation  which was impacted by gulf coast hurricanes and post hurricane refinery disruptions in  refined products delivery volumes increased in compared to  by product  deliveries of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel increased  and  respectively  in compared to year to year deliveries of natural gas liquids were down in versus the decrease was due to low demand for propane on both the north system  primarily due to a minimal grain drying season and warmer weather in  and the cypress pipeline  due to the hurricane related closure of a petrochemical plant in lake charles  louisiana 
the million increase in segment revenues in compared to primarily consisted of the following a million increase attributable to the acquisition of our southeast terminals  a million increase from our pacific operations  a million increase from our proportionate share of cochin  a million increase from our central florida pipeline  and a million increase from our west coast terminals our pacific operations year over year increase was due to both the higher terminal revenues  discussed above  and higher transport revenues  due largely to an almost increase in mainline delivery volumes 
cochin s increase was mainly due to a increase in delivery volumes and to higher average tariff rates in versus the increase in delivery volumes was due to two reasons 
first  lower product inventory levels in western canada in the first half of  caused by a drop in propane production due to lower profit margins from the extraction and sale of natural gas liquids  and secondly  a pipeline rupture and fire in july that led to the shutdown of the system for days during the third quarter of for our central florida pipeline  the increase in revenues in compared to reflected an almost increase in product delivery volumes  and for our west coast terminals  the revenue growth in related to increased terminal services  as described above 
combining all of the segment s operations  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products increased in compared to jet fuel delivery volumes  boosted by strong military and solid commercial demand  were up nearly in compared to  and gasoline delivery volumes increased 
deliveries of diesel fuel were essentially flat across both and  but both gasoline and diesel volumes were impacted in the fourth quarter of by the shut down of a refinery connected to the plantation pipeline following hurricane ivan 
excluding the effects attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments  the pacific operations pipeline rate case liability adjustment and the north system s inventory reconciliation adjustment  the segment s operating expenses increased million in compared to the overall increase included incremental expenses of million from our southeast terminals  including million from the terminals we acquired in november the overall increase in segment operating expenses also included an increase of million from our combined pacific and calnev pipeline operations 
the increase was mainly due to higher labor and operating expenses  including incremental power expenses  associated with increased transportation volumes and terminal operations  as well as higher maintenance  inspection  and pipeline integrity expenses incurred during as a result of environmental issues  repairs  clean up  and pipeline repairs associated with wash outs that were caused by flooding in the state of california in the first quarter of we also reported  in  operating expense increases of million from both our north system and our interest in cochin  and million from our west coast terminal operations 
the increase in our north system s expenses was primarily due to higher liquids storage expenses in  as discussed above 
the increase in cochin s expenses was primarily due to higher labor and outside services associated with pipeline maintenance and testing costs  incremental health  safety  and security work  and the full year s inclusion of our additional ownership interest  acquired on october  the increase from our west coast terminals was due to higher property tax expenses  described above  and higher cost of sales related to incremental terminal services 
the segment s operating expenses increased million in compared to the increase was mainly due to incremental expenses of million from our southeast terminals and to a million increase in expenses from our pacific operations  largely the result of higher fuel and power expenses associated with higher utility rates and higher delivery volumes 
the segment also reported a million year over year increase in expenses in from each of the following four businesses cochin pipeline  north system  calnev pipeline and plantation pipeline 
cochin s increase was related to higher expenses associated with increased delivery volumes and our additional ownership interest 
the north system s increase was primarily due to higher natural gas liquids storage expenses 
calnev s increase was mostly due to higher fuel and power expenses  due to favorable credit adjustments to electricity access and surcharge reserves taken in the first nine months of plantation s increase was primarily related to higher labor  testing and maintenance expenses 
earnings from our products pipelines equity investments were million in  million in and million in earnings from equity investments consist primarily of earnings from our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company which exclude interest income earned on loans to plantation and our ownership interest in heartland pipeline company  both accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the million decrease in equity earnings in compared to included a million decrease related to our investment in plantation and a million increase related to our investment in heartland 
for our investment in plantation  the decrease in was due to lower overall net income earned by plantation  due to  among other things  higher operating expenses and higher interest expenses 
for our investment in heartland  the increase in was primarily due to higher pipeline delivery volumes in versus the million decrease in equity earnings in compared to was mainly due to a million decrease in equity earnings from our investment in plantation 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million expense for our share of an environmental litigation settlement reached between plantation and various plaintiffs 
the segment s income from allocable interest income and other income and expense items increased million in compared to  and decreased million in compared to for  the increase primarily related to incremental interest income of million on our long term note receivable from plantation  as discussed above  for  the decrease was largely due to higher gains realized from sales of property  plant and equipment by our pacific operations during income tax expense was essentially flat across and  but decreased million in compared to the decrease was mainly due to lower income tax on cochin  largely due to the decrease in canadian operating results in non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments  were million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year over year increases in both and were primarily due to incremental depreciation charges related to the acquisition of our southeast terminals and to higher depreciation expenses from our pacific operations  related to the capital investment we have made since the end of in order to strengthen and enhance our business operations on the west coast 
for  we currently expect that our products pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over  excluding the effects from the environmental  rate case  and inventory expense adjustments discussed above 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by continued improvement in refined petroleum product delivery volumes and planned capital improvements and expansions

excluding the environmental adjustments  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in and million in both the million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to and the million increase in compared to were primarily driven by improved margins on recurring natural gas sales business and higher storage and service revenues from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  which includes the operations of the following four natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan tejas  kinder morgan texas pipeline  kinder morgan north texas pipeline and the mier monterrey mexico pipeline  and incremental contributions from the inclusion of our transcolorado pipeline  a mile interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from the western slope of colorado to the blanco natural gas hub in northwestern new mexico 
we acquired the transcolorado pipeline from kmi effective november  the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus excluding environmental adjustments included increases of million from the inclusion of transcolorado  million from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  million from our equity investment in the red cedar gathering company  million from our trailblazer pipeline  million from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission system  referred to as kmigt  and million from our equity investment in coyote gas treating  llc 
the segment s overall increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was offset by a million decrease in earnings from our casper douglas natural gas gathering system 
the decrease was primarily due to higher cost of sales  caused by higher natural gas purchase costs as a result of higher average gas prices  and to higher commodity hedging costs  due to unfavorable changes in settlement prices 
the increase in compared to from red cedar related to higher year over year net income that was largely driven by incremental revenues from sales of excess fuel gas  the result of both higher natural gas prices in and reductions in the amount of natural gas lost and used within the system during gathering operations  which increased volumes available for sale 
the increase from our trailblazer pipeline  a mile natural gas pipeline system that transports gas from near rockport  colorado to beatrice  nebraska  was mainly due to timing differences on the favorable settlements of pipeline transportation imbalances in versus these pipeline imbalances were caused by differences between the volumes nominated and volumes delivered at an inter connecting point by the pipeline 
the increase from kmigt was mainly due to lower operating expenses and higher revenues in  compared to the prior year 
the higher revenues were mainly due to favorable fuel recovery volumes and pricing and imbalance valuation adjustments  partially offset by lower operational sales margins and reduced cushion gas volumes sold in versus the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to kmigt s expensing  in the fourth quarter of  certain capitalized project costs that no longer held realizable economic benefits 
the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to excluding the environmental adjustment included increases of million from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group and million from the inclusion of transcolorado 
partially offsetting the overall increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization were decreases of million from our trailblazer pipeline and million from our investment in red cedar 
the decrease from trailblazer was mainly due to lower revenues  the decrease from our investment in red cedar was due to lower equity earnings as a result of overall lower net income 
the drop in trailblazer s revenues in compared to was the result of both timing differences on imbalance cashouts and lower transportation revenues 
the decrease in transportation revenues was due to lower gas transmission tariffs that became effective january   pursuant to a rate case settlement 
the year over year increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in both and from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group were mainly due to improved margins from natural gas sales activities  returns from capital investments and acquisitions made since the end of  and incremental earnings from natural gas transmission  storage  and other services 
the group has increased its gas transportation and storage revenues by both increasing services performed under existing agreements and by entering into additional service contracts 
our texas intrastate pipeline group has continued to grow internally and through acquisitions by constructing and acquiring new natural gas assets and by further refining the management of risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas 
effective august   we acquired our north dayton natural gas storage facility  located in liberty county  texas  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and million in assumed debt 
the north dayton facility includes billion cubic feet of natural gas working capacity and since its acquisition  the facility has allowed us to provide or offer needed services to utilities  the growing liquefied natural gas industry along the texas gulf coast  and other natural gas storage users 
internally  we benefited from incremental transportation revenues in both and from a mile intrastate natural gas pipeline providing transportation service between katy and austin  texas 
the line  acquired in december  was converted from carrying crude oil to natural gas and was placed into service in july in  we spent approximately million to convert and expand an additional mile segment of the line into the permian basin area of west texas 
the expansion accesses a number of natural gas processing plants in west texas and provides transportation service from mccamey  texas to just west of austin 
this segment commenced service in october the project is being phased in through the first quarter of  and the total project costs are expected to be approximately million 
in each of the years and  the segment reported significant increases in both revenues and operating expenses when compared to the year earlier period 
revenues earned by our natural gas pipelines segment increased  million in versus  and million in versus excluding the effects attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments  the segment s operating expenses  including natural gas purchase costs  increased  million in compared to  and million in compared to the increases in revenues and operating expenses in both years were largely due to higher natural gas sales revenues and higher natural gas cost of sales  due mainly to higher commodity prices 
our texas intrastate pipeline group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas  which is often stored and or transported on its pipelines 
the group s purchase and sale activities result in considerably higher revenues and operating expenses compared to the interstate operations of our rocky mountain pipelines  which include our kmigt  trailblazer and transcolorado pipelines 
all three pipelines charge a transportation fee for gas transmission service and have the authority to initiate natural gas sales primarily for operational purposes  but none engage in significant gas purchases for resale 
for the texas intrastate group combined  revenues from the sales of natural gas increased  million in compared to  and million in compared to similarly  costs of sales  including natural gas purchase costs  increased  million in compared to  and million in compared to in  the inclusion of our transcolorado pipeline accounted for incremental revenues and expenses of million and million  respectively  and in the two months of that we owned transcolorado  it reported revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
due to the fact that our texas intrastate group sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased  the increases in its gas purchase costs are largely offset by corresponding increases in its sales revenues 
our objective is to match purchases and sales in the aggregate  thus locking in an acceptable margin that is the equivalent of a transportation and or storage fee 
margin is defined as the difference between the prices at which we buy gas in our supply areas and the prices at which we sell gas in our market areas  less the cost of fuel to transport 
we manage remaining price risk by the use of energy financial instruments  such as over the counter forward contracts and both fixed price and basis swaps to help lock in favorable margins from our natural gas purchase and sales activities  thereby generating more stable earnings during periods of fluctuating natural gas prices 
total natural gas sales volumes decreased nearly in compared to  largely due to lower electric generation demand and to our efforts to reduce sales to lower margin customers 
in  the group benefited from both higher average gas prices and higher sales volumes when compared to we account for the segment s investments in red cedar gathering company  coyote gas treating  llc and thunder creek gas services  llc under the equity method of accounting 
in  equity earnings from these three investees increased million when compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to the higher net income earned by red cedar during  as described above 
earnings from equity investments decreased million in compared to the decrease was chiefly due to lower earnings from our investment in red cedar  mainly due to higher operational sales of natural gas by red cedar in the segment s non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments increased million in compared to the increase was largely due to the inclusion of incremental depreciation expense on the acquired transcolorado pipeline and to higher depreciation expenses on the assets of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  due to additional capital investments made since the end of depreciation  depletion and amortization charges decreased a slight million in compared to  primarily due to lower year to year depreciation expense on our trailblazer pipeline 
the decrease was due to a trailblazer rate case settlement which became effective january  for  we currently expect that our natural gas pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  essentially the same as the million in earnings reported in  excluding the effect from our environmental liability adjustments 
the earnings is expected to be driven by the continuing the sale of natural gas at favorable margins and by continuing to pursue expansion and extension projects off our existing asset base

i includes production attributable to leasehold ownership and production attributable to our ownership in processing plants and third party processing agreements 
our co segment consists of kinder morgan co company  lp and its consolidated affiliates 
the segment s primary businesses involve the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  commonly called co  and the production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas from ownership interests in field units located in the permian basin area of west texas 
in  our co segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million 
this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings included a million decrease and its earnings included a million increase from the adjustments of our environmental liabilities referred to in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
excluding the environmental adjustments  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in and million in both the million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to and the million increase in compared to were primarily driven by higher earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities  which include the operations associated with our ownership interests in oil producing fields and gas processing plants  improved performance from carbon dioxide sales  and incremental contributions from strategic acquisitions  which included additional working interests in crude oil field units in both and  and the kinder morgan wink pipeline in august our co segment s oil and gas producing and gas processing activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in and million in these operations include all construction  drilling and production activities necessary to produce oil and gas from its natural reservoirs  and all of the activities where natural gas is processed to extract liquid hydrocarbons  called natural gas liquids or commonly referred to as gas plant products 
both the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to and the million increase in compared to were primarily driven by increased crude oil and natural gas processing plant liquids production volumes and higher realized weighted average sale prices for crude oil and gas plant products 
the increase in compared to was also partly attributable to acquisitions of additional ownership interests in oil producing properties since the beginning of these acquisitions included the following effective june   we acquired mkm partners  lp s ownership interest in the sacroc oil field unit for million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the sacroc unit to approximately  and effective november   we acquired certain assets in the permian basin of west texas from a subsidiary of marathon oil corporation for million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities 
the assets acquired included marathon s approximate interest in the yates oil field unit  interest in the crude oil gathering system surrounding the yates field unit  and marathon s ownership interest in the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline company 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the yates oil field unit to nearly and allowed us to become operator of the field 
excluding the earnings effects attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments  our co segment s carbon dioxide sales and carbon dioxide and crude oil transportation activities reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in  million in and million in the year over year increases were driven by higher revenues from carbon dioxide sales  due to both higher average carbon dioxide sale prices and higher volumes  and higher carbon dioxide transportation volumes  related to infrastructure expansions at the sacroc and yates oil field units 
we do not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 
in and  we also benefited from the acquisition of the kinder morgan wink pipeline  a mile crude oil pipeline system originating in the permian basin of west texas and providing throughput to a crude oil refinery located in el paso  texas 
effective august   we acquired all of the partnership interests in kinder morgan wink pipeline  lp for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
the acquisition of the pipeline and associated storage facilities has allowed us to better manage crude oil deliveries from our oil field interests in west texas 
the kinder morgan wink pipeline accounted for incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in compared to the pipeline contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million during the last four months of we also benefited  in  from incremental contributions from our million centerline carbon dioxide pipeline  which was completed and began operations in may in  the centerline pipeline contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively 
revenues earned by our co business segment increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the increase in versus was mainly due to higher crude oil  gas plant product and carbon dioxide sales revenues  and higher crude oil transportation revenues 
additionally  effective january   we spent million in cash and assumed million in liabilities to acquire an approximate gross working interest in the claytonville oil field unit  also located in the permian basin 
in  claytonville contributed incremental revenues of million 
the increase in versus was mainly due to higher crude oil and gas plant product sales revenues  driven by higher production volumes  higher average crude oil and gas plant product prices  and the additional working interest in the yates oil field that we acquired in november combined  the assets we acquired on november  contributed incremental revenues of approximately million in combined daily oil production from the two largest oil field units in which we hold ownership interests increased in compared to  and in compared to the two oil field interests include our approximate working interest in the sacroc unit  located in scurry county  texas  and our approximate working interest in the yates oil field unit  located south of midland  texas 
similarly  natural gas plant liquids product sales volumes increased in compared to  and in compared to the year over year increases in oil production and gas plant product sales volumes were primarily due to the capital expenditures we have made since the end of we have made significant capital investments to increase the capacity and deliverability of carbon dioxide and crude oil in and around the permian basin 
in  capital expenditures for our co business segment totaled million  essentially the same as the million of capital expenditures we made during  but higher than the million of expenditures made in the year over year increases largely represented incremental spending for new well and injection compression facilities at the sacroc and  to a lesser extent  yates oil field units in order to enhance oil recovery from carbon dioxide injection 
we also benefited from increases in our realized weighted average price of oil and natural gas liquids per barrel of and  respectively  in compared to  and increases of and  respectively  in compared to as a result of our carbon dioxide and oil reserve ownership interests  we are exposed to commodity price risk associated with physical crude oil  gas plant product and carbon dioxide sales that have pricing tied to crude oil prices  but the risk is mitigated by our long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices 
our hedging strategy involves the use of financial derivative commodity instruments to manage this price risk on certain activities  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the sale of crude oil  natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide 
our strategy  as it relates to our oil production business  primarily involves entering into a forward sale or  in some cases  buying a put option in order to establish a known price level 
in this way  we use derivatives to lock in an acceptable margin between our production costs and our selling price  in an attempt to protect ourselves against the risk of adverse price changes and to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
all of our hedge gains and losses for crude oil and natural gas liquids are included in our realized average price for oil  none are allocated to natural gas liquids 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
additionally  in both and  we realized higher revenues from both carbon dioxide sales and carbon dioxide transportation services  driven by continued strong demand for carbon dioxide throughout the permian basin 
the increase in sales revenues was due to higher volumes and higher average prices  the increase in transportation services was mainly due to higher carbon dioxide transportation volumes 
combined deliveries of carbon dioxide on our central basin pipeline  our majority owned canyon reef carriers and pecos pipelines  our centerline pipeline  and our owned cortez pipeline  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting  increased in and in as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  in some cases  the cost of carbon dioxide that is associated with enhanced oil recovery is capitalized as part of our development costs when it is injected 
the carbon dioxide costs incurred and capitalized as development costs for our co segment were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we estimate that such costs will be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december   our projected expenditures for developing our proved undeveloped reserves will be approximately million in  million in  and million in excluding the effects attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments  our co segment s combined operating expenses increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the increases were primarily the result of higher property and production taxes  higher fuel and power costs  and higher operating and maintenance expenses 
the increases in taxes were due to the year over year increases in capitalized assets and oil production volumes 
the increases in fuel and power costs were due to increased carbon dioxide compression and equipment utilization  as well as higher rates paid to electricity providers 
the increases in operating and maintenance expenses were mainly due to additional labor and field expenses related to higher production volumes 
since mid  we have  however  benefited from the completion of a power plant we constructed at the sacroc oil field unit 
construction began in mid  and the project was completed at a cost of approximately million 
the power plant is being operated by kmi and is providing the majority of sacroc s current electricity needs 
earnings from equity investments decreased million in compared to the earnings in both years represent our interest in the net income of the cortez pipeline company  which owns and operates an approximate mile pipeline that carries carbon dioxide from the mcelmo dome source reservoir to the denver city  texas carbon dioxide hub 
the decrease in equity earnings in was due to lower overall net income earned by cortez  mainly as a result of lower carbon dioxide transportation revenues due to previously agreed lower tariff rates 
earnings from equity investments decreased million in compared to the decrease resulted from the absence of equity earnings  in  from our previous ownership interest in mkm partners  lp following our june  acquisition of its interest in the sacroc unit  mkm partners was dissolved effective june   and the lack of equity earnings in more than offset a million increase in equity earnings from our investment in cortez 
the increase in equity earnings from cortez was mainly due to higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes in versus non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  were up million in compared to and million in compared to the increases were primarily due to higher depreciable costs  related to incremental capital spending since the end of  and higher depletion charges  related to year over year increases in crude oil production volumes 
for  we currently expect that our co segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over the million in earnings reported in  excluding the effect from environmental liability adjustments 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by the continuing development of the sacroc and yates oil field units and the initiation of gas processing enhancements

the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings included a million decrease and its earnings included an million increase from the adjustments of our environmental liabilities referred to in critical accounting policies and estimates environmental matters 
excluding the environmental adjustments  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in and million in terminal operations acquired since the end of the third quarter of accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in since the end of the third quarter of  we invested approximately million in cash and million in common units to acquire assets and business operations included as part of our terminals segment 
the acquisitions were made in order to gain access to larger markets and to benefit from the economies of scale resulting from increases in storage  handling and throughput capacity 
the acquisitions helped increase segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in both and  and the most significant of these additions included the following the river terminals and rail transloading facilities owned and operated by kinder morgan river terminals llc and its consolidated subsidiaries  acquired effective october   our kinder morgan fairless hills terminal located along the delaware river in bucks county  pennsylvania  acquired effective december   our texas petroleum coke terminals  located in and around the ports of houston and beaumont  texas  acquired effective april   and three terminals acquired separately in july our kinder morgan staten island terminal  a dry bulk terminal located in hawesville  kentucky and a liquids dry bulk facility located in blytheville  arkansas 
for more information in regard to our terminal acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
for all other terminal operations those owned during both years  earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to excluding the environmental adjustments 
we believe that overall financial results would have been stronger in without the effects of two hurricanes 
in the third quarter of  hurricane katrina struck the louisiana mississippi gulf coast  and hurricane rita struck the texas louisiana gulf coast  causing wide spread damage to both residential and commercial property 
the assets we operate that were impacted by the storm included several bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in the states of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
most of our owned terminal sites were minimally impacted and suffered no significant structural damage 
terminals that were shutdown by the storms experienced relatively short term interruptions  however  throughput at both the liquids terminals and bulk handling facilities decreased in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in due to post hurricane production issues at a number of gulf coast refineries 
presently  all of the terminals have either resumed service or will do so in coordination with the start up of associated refineries  businesses and other infrastructure located along the gulf coast 
our terminals segment recognized  in  essentially all of our losses related to both hurricanes  and in total  the segment recognized million in expense in in order to meet its insurance deductible for hurricane katrina and another million to repair damaged facilities following hurricane rita 
we expect that the total costs incurred as a result of the two hurricanes will be less than million  including lost business at our terminal sites  but estimates are difficult because of insurance complexities and the extended recovery time involved 
we do not believe that the resolution of any remaining matters will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the overall million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from terminals owned during both and  included a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our two large gulf coast liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the two terminals serve as a distribution hub for houston s crude oil refineries  and their combined year to year increase in earnings was largely due to higher revenues  driven by higher sales of petroleum transmix  new customer agreements  and escalations in annual contract provisions 
since the end of  we have continued to invest in expansion projects at these two terminals  resulting in additional storage tanks that have increased leaseable capacity for refined petroleum product throughput 
for our entire liquids terminals combined  we have increased our liquids leaseable capacity by million barrels since the end of we accomplished this through a combination of business acquisitions and internal capital spending 
at the same time  we maintained an overall capacity utilization rate of over 
our liquids terminals utilization rate is the ratio of our actual output to our estimated potential output 
potential output is generally derived from measures of total capacity  taking into account periodic changes to terminal facilities due to additions  disposals  obsolescence  or other factors 
other contributions to the growth in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus included increases of million from terminals in our midwest region  and million from engineering and other terminal services 
for our midwest terminal region  the increase included higher earnings from our dakota bulk terminal  located along the mississippi river near st 
paul  minnesota  our argo  illinois liquids terminal  situated along the chicago sanitary and ship channel  and our milwaukee  wisconsin bulk commodity terminal 
the increase in earnings from dakota was primarily due to higher revenues generated by a cement unloading and storage facility  which began operations in late the increase from our argo terminal was mainly due to new customer contracts and higher ethanol handling revenues 
the increase from our milwaukee bulk terminal was mainly due to an increase in coal handling revenues related to higher coal truckage within the state of wisconsin 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to from terminals owned during both periods was partially offset by decreases of million from terminals in the lower mississippi river louisiana region  and million from terminals in the mid atlantic region 
the decrease from the louisiana region terminals was largely related to the negative effects of the two gulf coast hurricanes in  resulting in both lower revenues and higher fuel and power costs 
primarily affected was our international marine terminals facility  a louisiana partnership owned by us 
imt is a multi purpose bulk commodity transfer terminal facility located in port sulphur  louisiana 
its overall earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million in compared to  largely the result of property damage and a general loss of business due to the effects of hurricane katrina 
the year to year decrease from our mid atlantic terminals included a million decrease in earnings from our pier ix bulk terminal  located in newport news  virginia  and a million decrease in earnings from our chesapeake bay  maryland bulk terminal 
the decrease from pier ix was primarily due to higher operating expenses in compared to  due to incremental expenses associated with a new synfuel maintenance program and to higher demurrage expenses associated with increased cement imports 
the decrease from our chesapeake terminal was mainly due to higher operating expenses associated with higher movements of petroleum coke 
the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over excluding the environmental adjustment was driven by higher revenues from both our bulk and liquids terminal businesses  mainly due to the following higher transfer volumes of bulk products  higher demand for storage and distribution services offered for petroleum and liquid chemical products  and additional storage and throughput capacity due to both terminal acquisitions and the completion of capital projects since the end of for all bulk terminal facilities owned during both years  total transloaded bulk tonnage volumes increased almost in  as compared to we also completed  in  capital expansion and betterment projects at certain of our liquids terminal facilities that included the construction of additional petroleum products storage tanks 
the construction increased our liquids storage capacity by approximately  barrels  and at the same time  we maintained a liquids utilization capacity rate of 
approximately half of the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over was attributable to contributions from the bulk and liquids terminal businesses we acquired since the end of the third quarter of in addition to the acquisitions referred to above  these acquisitions included  among others  our kinder morgan tampaplex marine terminal and inland bulk storage warehouse facility  both located in tampa  florida and acquired in december combined  terminal operations acquired since the end of the third quarter of accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in for terminal operations owned during both and  earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization charges increased million and revenues increased million in  when compared to the prior year 
both increases were primarily attributable to record throughput at our gulf coast liquids terminals  and to higher coal  bulk and synfuel volumes from certain of our mid atlantic terminals  which include our chesapeake bay bulk terminal and our pier ix bulk terminal 
our two gulf coast liquids terminals located on the houston  texas ship channel  reported a combined million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues resulting from higher throughput volumes  contract price escalations  additional service contracts and new pipeline connections 
our chesapeake bay facility reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues  earned by providing additional stevedoring services and storage and transportation for products such as coal  petroleum coke  pig iron and steel slag 
our pier ix terminal  which transloads both coal and cement and operates a synfuel plant on site  reported a million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to the increase was driven by a million increase in revenues resulting from higher synfuel revenues and coal activity 
in february  pier ix began to operate a second synfuel plant on site 
segment revenues for all terminals owned during both and increased million in  when compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the following a million increase from our pasadena and galena park gulf coast liquids terminals  due primarily to higher petroleum transmix sales and to additional customer contracts and tankage capacity  a million increase from our midwest region  due primarily to higher cement handling revenues at our dakota terminal  increased tonnage at our milwaukee terminal  and higher marine fuel sales at our dravosburg  pennsylvania terminal  a million increase from our mid atlantic region  due primarily to higher coal volumes and higher dockage revenues at our shipyard river terminal  located in charleston  south carolina  higher cement  iron ore  and dockage revenues at our pier ix bulk terminal  and incremental revenues from our north charleston liquids bulk terminal  located just north of our shipyard facility and acquired effective april   and a million increase from our engineering and terminal design services  due to increased fee revenues discussed above 
segment revenues for all terminals owned during both and increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to the following a million increase from our mid atlantic region  due primarily to higher petroleum coke  coal  and iron volumes at our chesapeake bay facility  located in sparrows point  maryland  and to higher synfuel and coal tonnage at our pier ix bulk terminal  an million increase from our lower mississippi louisiana region  due primarily to higher tonnage and dockage revenue at our imt facility  partly offset by lower revenues at our harvey  louisiana liquids facility due to higher customer tankage release in  an million increase from our northeast region  due primarily to higher throughput and additional tankage at our carteret  new jersey liquids facility  and to higher volumes of salt  belgian block and scrap iron handled at our port newark terminal  and a million increase from our pasadena and galena park gulf coast liquids facilities  largely attributable to internal growth  resulting from both additional customer contracts and completed expansion projects undertaken to increase leaseable liquids capacity 
excluding the effects attributable to the and environmental liability adjustments  our terminal segment s combined operating expenses increased million in compared to  and million in compared to in addition to the incremental expenses related to our terminal acquisitions described above  the overall increases in segment expenses included year over year increases of million in from terminals owned during both and  and million in from terminals owned during both and the increase in expenses from terminals owned in both and was mainly due to higher expenses from our mid atlantic  midwest  louisiana and gulf coast terminals 
the mid atlantic increase was largely due to higher operating  maintenance and labor expenses at our pier ix and chesapeake bay facilities  discussed above  and to higher general and equipment maintenance and labor expenses at our shipyard river terminal  due to higher bulk tonnage volumes 
the increase in operating expenses from our midwest terminals included higher expenses at our milwaukee terminal  due to increased trucking and maintenance expenses associated with the increase in coal volumes  higher cost of sales expense at our dravosburg terminal  due to marine oil purchasing costs and inventory maintenance  and higher expenses at our dakota terminal  due to higher repair and labor expenses associated with higher cement volumes  and lower capitalized overhead in  due to the completion of its cement unloading and storage facility in late the increase in expenses from the terminals in our louisiana region was largely due to property damage related to the two gulf coast hurricanes in the third quarter of since the affected properties were insured  our expenses were limited to the amount of the deductible under our insurance policies 
the year to year increase in expenses from our gulf coast terminals was chiefly due to higher labor  fuel and power expenses 
the increase in expenses from terminals owned in both and was largely due to higher bulk tonnage transfer volumes and increased liquids throughput and storage capacity in the increases were primarily reflected as higher operating  maintenance  fuel and electricity expenses  including payroll  trucking  equipment rental and docking expenses  all related to increased dry bulk and liquids product transfers and ship conveyance activities 
income tax expenses totaled million in  million in excluding the million tax expense on earnings attributable to adjustments to the environmental liabilities recorded by taxable entities and million in the million increase in compared to was mainly attributable to higher taxable income and to certain permanent differences between taxable income and financial income  both related to kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc is the tax paying entity that owns many of our bulk terminal businesses which handle non qualifying products 
the million increase in income tax expense in compared to was primarily due to incremental expense related to the taxable income of kinder morgan river terminals llc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increase in versus was mainly due to incremental depreciation charges related to the terminal acquisitions we have made since the end of the third quarter of collectively  these acquisitions accounted for incremental depreciation expenses of million in  the remaining increase was associated with capital spending 
the increase in versus was primarily due to property acquisitions and capital spending  and to adjustments made to the estimated remaining useful lives of depreciable property since the end of for  we currently expect that our terminals segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  a increase over the million in earnings reported in  excluding the effect from environmental liability adjustments 
the earnings increase is expected to be driven by on going capital expansion projects  expected increases in bulk tonnage and liquids transfer volumes  and by incremental earnings from the inclusion of a full year of operations from the terminal operations we acquired during other year ended december  in thousands income expense general and administrative expenses    unallocable interest  net    minority interest    loss from early extinguishment of debt  cumulative effect adjustment from change in accounting principle  interest and corporate administrative expenses    items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income  interest expense and minority interest 
we also included both the million loss from our early extinguishment of debt in and the million benefit from the cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting for asset retirement obligations as of january  as items not attributable to any business segment 
the loss from the early extinguishment of debt represented the excess of the price we paid to repurchase and retire the principal amount of million of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds over the bonds carrying value 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to call and retire the bonds prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to refinance at lower rates  and we included the million loss under the caption other  net in our accompanying consolidated statement of income 
for more information on this early extinguishment of debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the cumulative benefit from our change in accounting for asset retirement obligations was accounted for as a change in accounting principal pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  our income before the cumulative effect adjustment totaled million per diluted unit 
for more information on this cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting principle  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  legal fees  unallocated litigation and environmental accruals  insurance and office supplies and rentals 
overall general and administrative expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in we continue to aggressively manage our infrastructure expense and to focus on our productivity and expense controls 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to included incremental litigation and environmental settlement expenses of million 
the additional expenses were associated with higher negotiated settlement costs in versus  including a million expense for a settlement reached in the first quarter between us and a shipper on our kinder morgan tejas natural gas pipeline system  and an million expense related to settlements of environmental matters at certain of our operating sites located in the state of california 
for more information on our litigation matters  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses reflected higher expenses incurred from kmi s operation of our natural gas pipeline assets  associated with higher actual costs in versus lower negotiated costs in  higher insurance expenses  largely due to higher workers compensation claims  and higher legal  benefits  and corporate secretary services 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was principally due to higher employee bonus and benefit expenses  higher corporate and employee related insurance expenses  and higher corporate service expenses  including legal  internal audit and human resources 
interest expense  net of unallocable interest income  totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in net interest charges in versus was due to both higher average debt borrowings and higher effective interest rates 
our average debt balance excluding the market value of interest rate swaps increased in compared to  largely due to incremental borrowings made in connection with both internal capital spending and external acquisitions 
additionally  we issued a net million in principal amount of senior notes on march   when we both closed a public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes and retired a principal amount of million 
the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings increased in compared to  reflecting a general rise in interest rates since the end of although our average borrowing rates were essentially flat across both and  we incurred a million increase in net interest charges in as a result of higher average debt levels 
our average borrowings increased in compared to  primarily due to both higher capital spending  related to internal expansions and improvements  and to incremental borrowings made in connection with acquisition expenditures 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
we use interest rate swap agreements to help manage our interest rate risk 
the swaps are contractual agreements we enter into in order to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
however  in a period of rising interest rates  these swaps will result in period to period increases in our interest expense 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
minority interest  representing the deduction in our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our five operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million decrease in compared to was chiefly due to lower net income allocated to the minority interest in the imt partnership in  due to business interruption caused by hurricane katrina 
the million increase in versus resulted mainly from higher overall partnership income  partly offset by our november acquisition of the remaining approximate ownership interest in midtex gas storage company  llp that we did not already own  thereby eliminating the associated minority interest 
liquidity and capital resources we attempt to maintain a conservative overall capital structure  with a long term target mix of approximately equity and debt 
the following table illustrates the sources of our invested capital dollars in thousands 
in addition to our results of operations  these balances are affected by our financing activities as discussed below december  long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps    minority interest    partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss    total capitalization    short term debt  less cash and cash equivalents   total invested capital    capitalization long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps 
minority interest partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss invested capital total debt  less cash and cash equivalents and excluding market value of interest rate swaps partners capital and minority interest  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through borrowings under our credit facility  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
short term liquidity we employ a centralized cash management program that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of inter company balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to federal energy regulatory commission enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are our revolving bank credit facility  our billion short term commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving bank credit facility  with the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility being reduced by our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and cash provided by operations 
in august  we replaced our previous five year credit facility that had a borrowing capacity of billion with a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of billion  and we increased our commercial paper program by million to provide for the issuance of up to billion 
our five year bank facility is due august   and can be used for general corporate purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program 
there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december  after inclusion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our bank facility was million as of december  in addition  on february   we entered into a second credit facility a million unsecured nine month credit facility that matures november  this new credit facility includes covenants and requires payment of facility fees that are similar in nature to the covenants and facility fees required by our five year credit facility 
for the year ended december   we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations  and we provided for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our commercial paper program and long term revolving credit facility 
as of december   our outstanding short term debt was million 
we intended and had the ability to refinance all of our short term debt on a long term basis under our unsecured long term credit facility 
accordingly  such amounts have been classified as long term debt in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate

at the time of the offering  we granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  common units from us on the same terms and conditions  and we issued an additional  common units on september  upon the underwriters exercise of this option 
after commissions and underwriting expenses  we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these  common units 
on november   we issued  in a public offering   of our common units at a price of per unit  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
after commissions and underwriting expenses  we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these common units 
we used the proceeds from both offerings to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
capital requirements for recent transactions during  our cash outlays for the acquisition of assets totaled million 
with the exception of our acquisitions of the bulk terminal operations from trans global solutions  inc and the ownership interests in general stevedores  lp from its previous partners  both of which were partially acquired by the issuance of additional common units  we utilized our commercial paper program to fund our acquisitions 
we then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our march issuance of long term senior notes and our august and november issuances of common units 
we intend to refinance the remainder of our current short term debt and any additional short term debt incurred during through a combination of long term debt  equity and the issuance of additional commercial paper to replace maturing commercial paper borrowings 
in february  a shelf registration statement became effective allowing us to issue up to a total of billion in debt and or equity securities

f represents commitments for the purchase of plant  property and equipment as of december  in our sustaining capital expenditure plan  we have budgeted million  primarily for the purchase of plant and equipment 
sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  versus  million in the year to year overall increase of million in cash flow from operations in compared to consisted of the following a million increase in cash from overall higher partnership income in  net of non cash items such as depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  undistributed earnings from equity investments  and non cash operating expense adjustments that included the million expense attributable to an increase in our reserves related to our rate case liability  and the million expense attributable to an increase in our environmental reserves  a million decrease in cash inflows relative to net changes in non current assets and liabilities  a million decrease relative to net changes in working capital items  and a million decrease related to lower distributions received from equity investments 
the higher partnership income reflects the increase in cash earnings from our four reportable business segments in  as discussed above in results of operations 
the decrease in cash inflows relative to net changes in non current assets and liabilities related to  among other things  higher payments made in to reduce long term liabilities and reserves for items such as natural gas imbalances  pipeline rate case liabilities  and other third party claims 
the decrease in cash inflows from working capital accounts was primarily due to higher income tax payments in compared to  as increases in accounts receivables  inventories  and other current assets were largely offset by increases in accounts payables and other current liabilities 
the decrease in cash inflows from our equity investees was primarily due to lower distributions received from cortez pipeline  due to lower overall partnership net income in versus the decrease from cortez more than offset a million increase in distributions received from red cedar as a result of higher year over year cash earnings 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the million overall decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was mainly attributable to a million decrease due to lower expenditures made for strategic business acquisitions  an million decrease due to higher net proceeds received from the sale of investments  property  plant and equipment  a million decrease related to lower contributions to equity investments  and a million increase due to higher capital expenditures 
we continue to make significant investments in strategic acquisitions 
for  our acquisition outlays totaled million  including cash outflows of million for the acquisition of our texas petroleum coke bulk terminal assets  million for our north dayton  texas natural gas storage facility  and million for the acquisition of our kinder morgan staten island liquids terminal 
for  our acquisitions totaled million  including cash outflows of million for the acquisition of our transcolorado pipeline from kmi  million for the acquisition of additional refined petroleum products terminals included in our southeast terminal operations  and million for the acquisition of our kinder morgan wink pipeline 
both our and acquisition expenditures are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the period to period decrease in cash used in investing activities as a result of higher proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment was largely due to the sales of certain surplus pumping units previously used in our co business segment 
the decrease in cash used relative to lower contributions paid to equity investees was mainly due to lower contributions to red cedar  largely due to its higher net income in compared to since the summer of  red cedar has increased it expansion capital spending and has funded a large portion of the expenditures with retained cash 
the million increase in cash used due to higher capital expenditures was driven by higher internal capital spending in our terminals and products pipelines business segments  as we continued to expand and grow our existing asset infrastructure through capital projects that further increase storage and throughput across our pipeline and terminal networks 
including expansion and maintenance projects  our capital expenditures were million in  compared to million in during  we continued construction work related to our previously announced million expansion of our pacific operations east line pipeline  which is expected to be completed in april when completed  the expansion will increase capacity on our el paso  texas to tucson  arizona pipeline by approximately  and on our tucson to phoenix  arizona pipeline by approximately 
in august  we announced plans for a second expansion to our east line pipeline 
this second expansion consists of replacing approximately miles of inch diameter pipe between el paso and tucson with inch diameter pipe 
the project also includes the construction of additional pump stations on the east line 
the project is expected to cost approximately million 
we began the permitting process for this project in september  we expect construction to begin in january  and we expect to complete the expansion project in the fourth quarter of expansion projects that contributed to internal growth in our terminals segment included adding storage tanks to increase leaseable capacity for refined petroleum products at our liquids terminals located on the houston ship channel and in the new york harbor area  along with expanding dock and handling capabilities at our kinder morgan tampaplex bulk terminal located in tampa  florida 
furthermore  in january  we announced a million expansion project at our perth amboy  new jersey liquids terminal located along the arthur kill river in the new york harbor 
the investment will involve the construction of nine new storage tanks with a capacity of million barrels for gasoline  diesel and jet fuel 
the new tanks are expected to be in service during the first quarter of in addition  during we announced the planned construction of our rockies express and kinder morgan louisiana pipelines 
the rockies express pipeline is a  mile pipeline that will transport up to billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the rocky mountains to eastern ohio and will cost over billion to complete 
we will operate the pipeline and initially hold a ownership interest 
sempra energy will hold the remaining ownership interest 
in addition  in exchange for shipper commitments to the project  we and sempra have granted options to june   to acquire equity in the project  which  if fully exercised  could result in us owning a minimum interest of and sempra owning a minimum interest of after the project is completed 
we will build and hold sole ownership interest in the kinder morgan louisiana pipeline  a mile pipeline that will cost approximately million 
the pipeline will provide takeaway capacity from the cheniere liquefied natural gas facility in louisiana and will deliver natural gas into the country s pipeline network 
we intend to finance these two projects with equity and debt 
we will issue equity for these projects in tranches to coincide with construction and in service dates 
the permanent debt for the rockies express pipeline  a joint venture  will likely be non recourse to us 
our sustaining capital expenditures were million in  compared to million in sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  while in the prior year  our financing activities provided net cash of million 
the million overall decrease in cash inflows provided by financing activities was primarily due to a million decrease from higher partnership distributions  a million decrease from overall equity issuances  and a million decrease from lower cash book overdrafts  and a million increase from overall debt financing activities 
the million year to year decrease from higher partnership distributions in versus was due to an increase in the per unit cash distributions paid  an increase in the number of units outstanding and an increase in our general partner incentive distributions 
we paid distributions of per unit in compared to per unit in the increase in distributions paid per unit principally resulted from favorable operating results in the increase in our general partner incentive distributions resulted from both increased cash distributions per unit and an increase in the number of common units and i units outstanding 
cash distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders including kmi  our general partner  and minority interests  increased to million in compared to million in we also distributed  and  i units in quarterly distributions during and  respectively  to kmr  our sole i unitholder 
the amount of i units distributed in each quarter was based upon the amount of cash we distributed to the owners of our common and class b units during that quarter of and for each outstanding i unit that kmr held  a fraction of an i unit was issued 
the fraction was determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average of kmr s shares closing market prices for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares began to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange 
the million decrease in cash inflows from partnership equity issuances was primarily related to the incremental cash we received from our issuances of both common and i units over cash received from our issuance of common units 
in  we received proceeds of million from additional partnership equity issuances  primarily consisting of the following amounts are net of all commissions and underwriting expenses million received from our issuance of  common units in an august public offering  and million received from our issuance of  common units in a november public offering 
in  we received proceeds of million from additional partnership equity issuances  primarily consisting of the following amounts are net of all commissions and underwriting expenses million received from our issuance of  common units in a february public offering  million received from our issuance of  i units in march to kmr  million received from our issuance of  common units in a november public offering  and million received from our issuance of  i units in november to kmr 
in both and  we used the proceeds from each of these issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
the million year to year decrease in cash inflows from lower cash book overdrafts  which represent outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit  resulted from a lower amount of outstanding checks in  due to timing differences in the payments of year end accruals and outstanding vendor invoices in versus the overall year to year decrease in cash inflows provided by our financing activities included a million increase in cash inflows from overall debt financing activities  which include issuances and payments of debt  loans to related parties and debt issuance costs 
the increase in cash inflows from our debt financing activities was mainly attributable to the following a million increase due to higher net commercial paper borrowings in versus  a million increase from net changes in our related party loan to plantation pipe line company 
in july  we loaned plantation million  which corresponded to our ownership interest  in exchange for a seven year note receivable bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
the loan allowed plantation to pay all of its outstanding credit facility and commercial paper borrowings 
as of december   the principal amount receivable from this note was million  an million increase related to payments  in  to redeem and retire the principal amount of five series of tax exempt bonds related to certain liquids terminal facilities 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to call and retire the bonds prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to refinance at lower rates  a million increase related to payments  in  to retire a significant portion of the million of outstanding debt assumed as part of our october acquisition of kinder morgan river terminals  llc  a million increase related to payments  in  to retire all of the outstanding debt assumed as part of our august acquisition of kinder morgan wink pipeline  lp  a million decrease from the retirement of senior notes due march  on that date  we paid a maturing amount of million in principal amount of senior notes  a million decrease related to payments  in  to retire all of the outstanding debt assumed as part of our july acquisition of general stevedores  lp  and a million decrease related to payments  in  to retire principal amounts of unsecured senior notes assumed as part of our august acquisition of the north dayton  texas natural gas storage facility 
in addition  in each of march and november  we closed public offerings of million in principal amount of senior notes 
the offerings resulted in cash inflows  net of discounts and issuing costs  of million and million  respectively 
during each of the years and  we used our commercial paper borrowings to fund our asset acquisitions  capital expansion projects and other partnership activities 
we subsequently raised funds to refinance a portion of those borrowings by completing public offerings of senior notes  issuing additional common units and  in only  issuing additional i units 
we used the proceeds from these debt and equity issuances to reduce our borrowings under our commercial paper program 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed  and  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements  respectively calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
each time we make a distribution  the number of i units owned by kmr and the percentage of our total units owned by kmr increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of and greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
litigation and environmental matters as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  in the amount of million 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
the reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities in the amount of million 
the reserve is primarily related to various claims from lawsuits arising from our pacific operations pipeline transportation rates  and the contingent amount is based on both the circumstances of probability and reasonability of dollar estimates 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these claims in order to determine the adequacy of our liability provision 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our pending environmental and litigation matters  respectively 
we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of december   the date of enactment  and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines must be completed by march  we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our budget and capital expenditure plan 
please refer to notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding litigation and regulatory matters 
pursuant to our continuing commitment to operational excellence and our focus on safe  reliable operations  we have implemented  and intend to implement in the future  enhancements to certain of our operational practices in order to strengthen our environmental and asset integrity performance 
these enhancements have resulted and may result in higher operating costs and sustaining capital expenditures  however  we believe these enhancements will provide us the greater long term benefits of improved environmental and asset integrity performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions 
energy financial instruments we are exposed to commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect our financial position against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy financial instruments to reduce and minimize our risks associated with unpredictable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
the instruments we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our risk management policies prohibit us from engaging in speculative trading and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
furthermore  our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we purchase energy financial instruments are as follows credit rating morgan stanley a j 
aron company goldman sachs a bnp paribas aa we account for our risk management derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and sfas no 

according to the provisions of sfas no 
 derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  and in general  gains and losses on derivatives are reported on the income statement 
however  as discussed above  our principal use of energy financial instruments is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
sfas no 
categorizes such use of energy financial derivatives as cash flow hedges and prescribes special hedge accounting treatment for such derivatives 
using derivatives to help provide us certainty with regard to our operating cash flows helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  gains and losses on the hedging instruments are reported in other comprehensive income  not net income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the hedging instruments can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivatives gains and losses goes to other comprehensive income  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
all remaining gains and losses on the hedging instruments the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the hedging instrument and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
under current accounting rules  the accumulated components of other comprehensive income  including the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative instruments designated and qualified as cash flow hedges  are to be reported separately as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
accordingly  our application of sfas no 
has resulted in deferred net loss amounts of  million and million being reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
in future periods  as the hedged cash flows from our actual purchases and sales of energy commodities affect our net income  the related gains and losses included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of our hedging are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
financial instruments evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  is offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
we utilize both variable rate and fixed rate debt in our financing strategy 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively  compared to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding market value of interest rate swaps  was million as of december  and million as of december  fair value was determined using future cash flows discounted based on market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  respectively  including adjustments for notional swap amounts  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
we entered into these swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
as of december   all of our interest rate swaps represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount of billion  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
