item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview textron inc is a multi industry company that leverages its global network of businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services in four business segments bell  cessna  industrial and finance 
textron is known around the world for its powerful brands spanning the business jet  aerospace and defense  plastic fuel systems  golf car and turf care markets  among others 
the global economy continued to grow in most of our major markets in  despite early weakness in some regions  including parts of europe 
the us economy  in particular  proved resilient in the face of hurricanes katrina and rita 
overall capital spending continued to grow at a steady and sustainable rate 
our company s performance is strongly related to this key economic factor  which reflects investments in longer lasting items such as equipment  facilities and vehicles 
we had strong sales in particularly in our aerospace and defense businesses 
we were able to deliver exceptional organic growth gains from existing business  excluding the effects of acquisitions and other changes of  which is the result of our commitment to bringing new products and services to our customers 
orders were strong  most notably at bell  where a steady flow of military orders resulted from continued spending in the defense sector and we received robust orders in our commercial helicopter business 
cessna also saw a significant increase in new business jet orders as a result of strength in the aircraft sector and the popularity of its new model introductions  and our finance segment experienced significant improvement in its portfolio credit quality with fewer charge offs and a decrease in nonperforming assets 
however  industrial volumes were down slightly from largely due to a downturn in the north american automotive industry 
while we were impacted by inflation and higher pension costs in  we were able to absorb the impact of these factors primarily as a result of the increased volumes and the benefit of our transformation strategy to reduce costs  introduce new products and enhance our portfolio of businesses 
we will continue to execute our transformation strategy and position textron to take advantage of the improved economic conditions 
to strengthen our overall position in our markets  we have continued to improve upon our portfolio of businesses 
during  we sold our interest in the model ab helicopter program to agusta  our partner in the baac venture 
we also purchased us helicopter to increase bell s ability to provide after sales service  bought out kautex s japanese joint venture partner to take advantage of a rapidly growing market  and set up a new joint venture with a german company  rothenberger ag  to expand our presence in north american plumbing tools 
in december  our board of directors authorized management s plan for the divestiture of our textron fastening systems business 
with this approval  we have committed to actively market this business and anticipate no significant changes to the approved plan and the completion of the sale within the next twelve months 
as a result  this business was reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of consolidated results of operations revenues billion segment profit billion

other charges gain textron records any charges incurred or gains realized in connection with the disposition of the automotive trim business trim as special charges 
in connection with this disposition of trim to subsidiaries of collins aikman corporation c a  textron finance has recourse to textron manufacturing for equipment leases with the subsidiaries 
the outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately million at december  during the fourth quarter of  the lease term for these leases expired and c a failed to make one of its lease payments 
while textron finance is currently in negotiations with c a to renew these leases  textron manufacturing recorded an additional reserve of million in the fourth quarter of based on uncertainties related to these leases 
in addition to the textron finance equipment leases  certain operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of c a upon the sale of trim

share based compensation during the first quarter of  textron elected to adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method 
the adoption resulted in recognition of share based compensation expense related primarily to the expensing of stock options in continuing operations of approximately million million after tax for the year ended december   including the net impact of the cumulative effect of adoption of approximately million in the first quarter  and million million after tax in discontinued operations

there was no gain or loss on the sale of omniquip and the small business direct businesses in special charges represent restructuring costs incurred by textron fastening systems  intesys and omniquip in connection with the company wide restructuring program 
outlook we expect higher revenues in as a result of revenue increases at bell  cessna and finance  while the industrial businesses are expected to be down slightly 
at bell  revenues are expected to increase primarily due to higher commercial helicopter deliveries 
at cessna  we expect an increase in revenue due to higher sales of jets based on our current delivery schedule 
textron s commercial backlog from unaffiliated customers was billion and billion at the end of and  respectively  and is primarily related to cessna 
us government backlog was billion at the end of and  which was substantially all in the bell segment

segment analysis bell dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog at bell helicopter the bell segment is a supplier of aircraft and weapon systems providing advanced product and service solutions to both military and commercial customers 
bell helicopter is a leading manufacturer of military helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft for the us government and commercial helicopters for corporate  offshore petroleum exploration and development  utility  charter  police  fire  rescue and emergency medical customers 
textron systems is a primary supplier to the defense  aerospace and general aviation markets 
bell helicopter participates in several major programs with the us government 
in association with the boeing company  bell helicopter is the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft the v the us government has issued contracts for production v aircraft with a total requirement of aircraft 
in september  bell received authorization to proceed to full rate production of the v bell helicopter is nearing completion of the engineering and manufacturing development emd phase of the h upgrade program for the us marine corps 
this program will produce an advanced attack and a utility model helicopter  the ah z and uh y  respectively 
the operational evaluation for this program is planned to begin shortly after the delivery of the remaining two aircraft in the us government has also issued contracts for the production of ten uh y aircraft and six ah z aircraft through low rate initial production 
a contract for an additional lot  along with a priced option for another lot  is planned to be exercised in the second quarter of additionally  bell was awarded a contract for system development and demonstration of the army s armed reconnaissance helicopter arh with an expected requirement of aircraft 
bell will also participate in the production of the vh presidential helicopter fleet through awb llc 
during  bell helicopter s commercial business gained momentum with an increase in orders and deliveries 
bell continued to invest in commercial programs as evidenced by the significant progress made on the global ranger and other program upgrades in response to customer requests to improve speed  lower operating costs and reduce noise 
textron systems principal strategy and focus is to address the emphasis being placed by the us department of defense on network centric warfare and the leveraging of advances in information technology by focusing on the development and production of advanced weapon systems 
additionally  textron systems has received orders to deliver more than  armored security vehicles asv 
currently  production capacity is ramping up to meet these deliveries in spite of the disruptions caused by hurricane katrina 
bell revenues us government business us government revenues increased million in primarily due to higher revenue of million from the v program  higher asv volume of million  the benefit of million from the us helicopter acquisition  higher military spares volume of million and increased sales of million for air launched weapons 
additionally  bell recognized million from the new arh contract 
us government revenues decreased million in largely due to lower revenue of million on the v program primarily as a result of lower effort on production lots three through six as these contracts neared completion and a decrease in development activities 
lower sales of million related to the completion of a contract for training aircraft in and an million reduction in revenue  related to a final agreement with the us government to settle an overhead cost rate matter  also contributed to the revenue decrease 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by million of higher military spares volume  increased sales of million for air launched weapons and higher h revenue of million 
commercial business commercial revenues increased million in primarily due to higher aircraft sales of million  higher spares volume of million and higher international military sales of million due primarily to higher asv deliveries to foreign customers of million that were partially offset by lower helicopter volume of million 
commercial revenues increased million in primarily due to higher international military sales of million  increased volume in the aircraft engine business of million and higher spares volume of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower huey ii kit sales of million and lower aircraft sales of million 
bell segment profit us government business profit in the us government business increased million in principally due to higher v volume of million  reflecting the delivery of aircraft from lots and  higher volume and improved performance of air launched weapons totaling million  and increased asv deliveries and improved performance of million 
these increases were partially offset by million of costs associated with hurricane katrina 
profit in the us government business decreased million in primarily due to the million impact of lower v revenue  an million settlement with the us government and lower volume of training aircraft of million  partially offset by the million impact of higher volume of air launched weapons 
commercial business commercial profit increased million in primarily due to the million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab helicopter program  the million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance  higher spares volume of million and a million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement 
in addition  commercial profit reflected a million decrease in net research and development  as higher gross research and development expenses of million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risk sharing agreements from co development partners 
these increases were partially offset by million of higher selling and administrative expense and million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming related to the retirement program discussed below and crankshaft service bulletins discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  lycoming developed a plan to institute a retirement program for approximately  crankshafts  representing the remaining crankshafts manufactured by the former supplier using the same forging technique as the crankshafts covered by prior service bulletins 
accordingly  an additional reserve of million was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the expected cost of this planned retirement program 
commercial profit increased million in primarily due to the million impact of the higher international military sales  favorable cost performance in the helicopter business of million including the favorable resolution of a million warranty issue provided for in  the million benefit from a favorable mix of aircraft and the million favorable impact of a nonrecurring charge related to a recall  inspection and customer care program at the aircraft engine business  partially offset by higher engineering expenses of million 
bell outlook bell s revenues are expected to increase in  while margins are expected to drop slightly due to the certain nonrecurring items that benefited the results 
the us government business is expected to benefit from an increase in asv volume as well as higher revenues from the arh and vh program contracts  which is expected to be partially offset by lower v revenue based on scheduled deliveries 
higher revenue is expected in our commercial business largely due to increased deliveries in cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog cessna aircraft company is the world s largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft  based on unit sales 
cessna currently has four major product lines citation business jets  single engine turboprop caravans  cessna single engine piston aircraft and aftermarket services 
cessna provides dependable aircraft and premier service to corporate customers in over countries 
cessna also engages in the business jet fractional ownership market through citationshares  a venture with tag aviation usa  inc during  the economy continued to strengthen  leading to a significant increase in business jet and single engine aircraft orders 
at the same time  cessna also realized the benefit of its continued strategy of investment in new product development receiving faa certification for the cj and the cj in cessna also expects to receive certification of the mustang in cessna revenues the cessna segment s revenues increased billion in  compared with  primarily due to higher citation business jet volume of million  higher pricing of million and a benefit from the consolidation of citationshares of million 
citation business jet customer deliveries were in  compared with jets in the cessna segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the million increase from the consolidation of citationshares  million of higher pricing and a million benefit from lower to used aircraft overtrade allowances 
citation business revenue jet deliveries were in  compared with jets in cessna segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  largely due to the million impact of higher volume across all product lines and million of higher pricing  partially offset by million of inflation 
additionally  cessna was able to significantly improve profit margins and overcome the challenges associated with ramping up production and increasing research and development expenses 
segment profit increased million in  compared with  largely due to million of improved cost performance  million of higher pricing  million of lower used aircraft valuation adjustments  a million benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and an million benefit related to the expiration of prior year residual value guarantees  partially offset by million of inflation and the unfavorable impact of lower business jet volume and unfavorable mix of million 
the benefit from lower used aircraft overtrade allowances and valuation adjustments was primarily due to fewer trade ins and a stabilization in market values for used jets in cessna outlook cessna anticipates another strong year of business jet deliveries in with total revenues expected to increase significantly 
indications are that will be a strong delivery year as well 
in  profit margins are expected to rise  primarily driven by the increase in revenue 
cessna will continue to invest in new products such as the encore and the mustang  broadening our product line to take advantage of the improving business jet market 
industrial dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin the industrial segment is composed of five businesses  including e z go  jacobsen  kautex  greenlee and fluid power 
through these businesses  the segment provides its customers with innovative solutions and services  including golf cars and turf care equipment  plastic fuel systems  wire and cable installation equipment  and industrial pumps and gears 
these markets are highly competitive and price sensitive 
consequently  significant cost reductions are required not only to offset inflation and price concessions  primarily at kautex  but also to improve margins 
industrial revenues the industrial segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  as higher pricing of million and favorable foreign exchange of million were largely offset by lower volume of million 
the lower sales volume primarily reflects decreases of million at kautex  largely due to product model changeovers  and million at jacobsen  primarily related to the strategic realignment of its north american commercial distribution network 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volume of million at greenlee 
the industrial segment s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange impact of million and higher sales volume of million  partially offset by million related to the divestiture of a non core product line during the second quarter of the higher sales volume primarily reflects an increase of million at kautex  largely due to new product launches and growth in its international markets  and to a lesser degree increases of million and million at e z go and jacobsen  respectively 
industrial segment profit segment profit decreased million in  compared with  largely due to inflation of million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of million  partially offset by higher pricing of million and improved cost performance of million  primarily at kautex 
segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to million of improved cost performance  improved credit performance of million  the favorable foreign exchange impact of million  the million impact of higher volume and lower fair market value adjustments of million for used golf cars 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million and lower profit of million at a north american kautex plant due to increased costs from manufacturing inefficiencies 
industrial outlook industrial revenues are expected to decrease in  while segment margins are forecasted to improve slightly 
the forecasted decrease in revenues reflects a decline at kautex  primarily as a result of model changeovers and the divestiture of a product line in  which is expected to be partially offset by growth at greenlee and  to a lesser extent  increases for the remaining businesses 
finance dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin the finance segment is a diversified commercial finance business with core operations in aircraft finance  asset based lending  distribution finance  golf finance  resort finance and structured capital 
its financing activities are confined almost exclusively to secured lending and leasing to commercial markets 
within these core operations  this segment also provides financing programs for products manufactured by textron 
in  management continued its focus on growing its core business while liquidating non core assets 
finance revenues the finance segment s revenues increased million in  compared with the increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of million  partially offset by lower prepayment income of million 
the increase in finance charges and discounts was largely due to a higher interest rate environment  which accounted for million of the increase  and million related to higher average finance receivables of million  partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of million 
the increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution  golf and aircraft finance and asset based lending  partially offset by reductions in the liquidating non core portfolios 
the finance segment s revenues decreased million in  compared with the decrease was primarily due to lower finance charges and discounts of million  largely due to the continued liquidation of non core assets resulting in lower average finance receivables of million  and a reduction of discount earnings in the distribution finance business 
the decrease was partially offset by higher securitization gains of million  primarily due to improved yield  and million from an increase in average finance receivables sold to the distribution finance revolving conduit  partially offset by a million reduction in resort finance gains 
finance segment profit segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality  and an million increase in net interest margin  which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of million 
the increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth 
selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost 
segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses  reflecting an improvement in portfolio quality  partially offset by lower net interest margin of million 
finance portfolio quality the following table presents information about the credit quality of the finance segment s portfolio in millions  except for ratios provision for loan losses nonperforming assets ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets allowance for losses on finance receivables recorded on balance sheet ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables net charge offs days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables the finance segment has experienced significant improvements in portfolio quality over the past two years 
the improvements in credit quality were evident through lower nonperforming asset levels and days contractual delinquency 
textron finance s nonperforming assets include nonaccrual accounts that are not guaranteed by textron manufacturing  for which interest has been suspended  and repossessed assets 
nonperforming assets for each of the last three year ends by business are as follows in millions resort finance aircraft finance golf finance asset based lending distribution finance other total nonperforming assets we believe that nonperforming assets will generally be in the range of to of finance assets depending on economic conditions 
textron finance experienced significant improvement in total nonperforming assets with a million decrease in and a million decrease in the decrease in was primarily attributable to core businesses  including million in resort finance and million in golf finance  largely related to improved general economic conditions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in liquidating portfolios 
these non core businesses continue to compose a disproportionate amount of textron finance s nonperforming assets accounting for of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than of the total finance assets at december  finance outlook in  we expect the finance segment s profit to increase primarily as a result of improved net interest margin related to higher average finance receivables 
special charges by segment restructuring expense other other total severance contract fixed asset associated charges special in millions costs terminations impairments costs total gain charges industrial corporate bell industrial corporate bell cessna industrial finance corporate liquidity and capital resources textron s financings are conducted through two borrowing groups textron manufacturing and textron finance 
this framework is designed to enhance textron s borrowing power by separating the finance segment 
to support creditors in evaluating the separate borrowing groups  textron presents separate balance sheets and statements of cash flows for each borrowing group 
textron manufacturing consists of textron inc  the parent company  consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell  cessna and industrial business segments  whose financial results are a reflection of the ability to manage and finance the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services 
textron finance consists of textron s wholly owned commercial finance subsidiary  textron financial corporation  consolidated with its subsidiaries 
the financial results of textron finance are a reflection of its ability to provide financial services in a competitive marketplace  at appropriate pricing  while managing the associated financial risks 
the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities result in different measures used by investors  rating agencies and analysts 
a portion of textron finance s business involves financing retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by textron manufacturing 
the cash flows related to these captive financing activities are reflected as operating activities by textron manufacturing and as investing activities by textron finance based on each group s operations 
these captive financing transactions have been eliminated  and cash from customers or from securitizations is recognized in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows when received 
textron inc provides a support agreement to textron finance that requires textron inc to maintain ownership of textron finance 
the agreement also requires textron finance to maintain fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
textron finance s bank agreements prohibit the termination of the support agreement 
textron s financial position continued to be strong at the end of and included aggregate cash and cash equivalents of million  compared with million at the end of during  cash flows from operations were the primary source of funds for our operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures 
management analyzes operating cash flows for textron manufacturing by tracking free cash flow  which is calculated using net cash provided by operating activities  adding back proceeds on the sale of property  plant and equipment  then subtracting capital expenditures  including those financed with capital leases 
operating cash flows of continuing operations in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance operating cash flows on a consolidated basis have remained fairly consistent over the past few years 
these consolidated cash flows exclude net captive financing activity cash outflows from finance receivable originations  net of cash inflows from repayments  sales and securitizations between textron manufacturing and textron finance 
in and  this net captive financing activity increased textron manufacturing s separate cash flows by million and million  respectively  while in  cash flows were decreased by million 
excluding these net changes from textron manufacturing s cash flows  the increase in is largely due to increased income from operations  while the increase in is largely due to increased customer deposits in the bell and cessna segments resulting from an increase in orders for jets and commercial helicopters 
textron manufacturing s operating cash flows include after tax cash used to fund textron s restructuring program of million in  million in and million in this program was substantially completed at the end of with forecasted cash payments in of approximately million 
investing cash flows of continuing operations in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance over the past three years  textron s consolidated cash flows used in investing activities have been largely driven by an increase in net financing activities at textron finance 
the and increases in cash used in investing activities in the consolidated cash flows reflect a higher use of cash resulting from the increase in finance receivable originations  net of cash collections from repayments  sales and securitizations  of million and million  respectively 
textron manufacturing increased its use of cash for investing activities by million in primarily with a million increase in capital expenditures and a million decrease in proceeds that were received in from the sale of c a common stock 
the increase in capital expenditures is primarily related to higher spending at the bell segment in response to increased production demands 
capital expenditures for textron manufacturing totaled million in  million in and million in  including expenditures purchased through capital leases of million in  million in and million in the separate borrowing group cash flows of textron finance reflect investing activities that include million  million and million in non cash activity for finance receivables originated in connection with the sale of textron manufacturing s inventory in  and  respectively 
cash received from customers and securitizations related to the sale of this inventory is also included within textron finance s investing activities totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
within the consolidated statements of cash flows these amounts have been eliminated from investing activities and are recorded as a net amount in operating cash flows under the caption captive finance receivables  net 
financing cash flows of continuing operations in millions consolidated textron manufacturing textron finance the increase in cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows was largely due to an increase in debt outstanding at both textron manufacturing and textron finance 
the increase in textron manufacturing principally reflects a retirement of debt of million in and the issuance of million in short term debt in textron finance increased its debt outstanding to fund asset growth 
these increases were partially offset by higher cash outflows from a million increase in purchases of textron common stock  million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans and a million increase in dividend payments  primarily due to the timing of dividend payments with four quarters paid in and only three quarters paid in in  the decrease in cash used by financing activities in the consolidated cash flows principally reflects a million increase in cash provided by textron finance reflecting an increase in debt outstanding to fund asset growth  partially offset by a decrease at textron manufacturing largely due to higher cash outflows from a million increase in purchases of textron common stock 
principal payments and retirements of long term debt in  and  textron manufacturing made principal payments of million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  textron finance made principal payments on long term debt of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
stock repurchases on january   textron s board of directors authorized a new million share repurchase program 
this program supercedes textron s previous authorization  which was exhausted in january 
in  and  textron repurchased approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  under its board authorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively 
dividends textron s board of directors approved dividends of per common share in on january   the board of directors authorized a per share increase in textron s annualized common stock dividend to per share and  accordingly  a quarterly dividend of per share for holders of record at the close of business on march  dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the payments include an additional payment made for the fourth quarter dividend  which is typically paid in the following year 
discontinued operations cash flows in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows from discontinued operations include textron manufacturing s fastening systems  omniquip and intesys businesses  and textron finance s small business finance operation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 
in  cash provided by investing activities included the receipt of million in cash upon the sale of substantially all of the small business finance operation  and million in tax refunds and cash proceeds related to the sale of the omniquip business  partially offset by million in finance receivable originations  net of repayments 
capital resources textron manufacturing s debt net of cash to capital ratio as of december  was  compared with at january  textron manufacturing s gross debt to capital ratio as of december  was  compared with at january  textron manufacturing has established a gross debt to capital ratio target in the mid thirties 
consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community  leverage of the manufacturing operations excludes the debt of textron finance 
in turn  textron finance limits its borrowings to an amount  taking into account the risk profile of its assets  consistent with a single a credit rating 
surplus capital of textron finance is returned to textron inc borrowings have historically been a secondary source of funds for textron manufacturing and  along with the collection of finance receivables  are a primary source of funds for textron finance 
both textron manufacturing and textron finance utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs 
our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flow and satisfy certain financial ratios 
since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost  we target a long term a rating from the independent debt rating agencies 
in november  fitch upgraded its outlook for textron manufacturing and textron finance to positive  while moody s and standard poor s have assessed the outlook for both groups as stable 
the credit ratings of these three debt ratings agencies are as follows standard fitch moody s poor s long term textron manufacturing a a a textron finance a a a short term textron manufacturing f p a textron finance f p a for liquidity purposes  textron manufacturing and textron finance have a policy of maintaining sufficient unused lines of credit to support their outstanding commercial paper 
none of these lines of credit was used at december  or january  textron manufacturing has primary revolving credit facilities of billion that expire in textron manufacturing s credit facilities permit textron finance to borrow under those facilities 
textron finance also has billion in bank lines of credit  of which million expires in july and billion expires in textron finance s facility that expires in includes a one year term out option that effectively extends its expiration into at december   the lines of credit not reserved as support for commercial paper and letters of credit were billion for textron manufacturing and million for textron finance 
under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  textron finance may issue public debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of billion 
under this registration statement  textron finance issued billion of term debt and cad billion of term debt during the proceeds from these issuances were used to fund receivable growth and repay short term debt 
at december   textron finance had billion available under this registration statement 
textron manufacturing may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of billion under its shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
at december   textron manufacturing had billion available under this registration statement 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes textron manufacturing s known contractual obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied payment due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total textron manufacturing liabilities reflected in balance sheet long term debt capital lease obligations pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total textron manufacturing long term debt and capital lease obligations included in the table above do not include interest payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
textron maintains defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments to be made by textron related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
textron also expects to make contributions to its funded pension plans in the range of million to million per year over the next five years  which are not reflected in this table 
other long term liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which textron is committed to purchase goods and services as of december  textron s ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
effective january   textron engaged a third party service provider to assume oversight of its information technology infrastructure  including maintenance  operational oversight and purchases of hardware the it contract 
the it contract covers a year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications 
textron retains the right to approve significant design  equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider 
textron has the ability to terminate the it contract prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed million in in addition to the amounts included above  textron manufacturing has contractual obligations related to certain businesses reported as discontinued operations  primarily related to purchase obligations and post retirement benefit obligations other than pensions 
these amounts are estimated to be paid as follows million in less than one year  million in two years  million in three years  million in four years  million in five years and million in more than five years 
the following table summarizes textron finance s known contractual obligations to make future payments 
due to the nature of finance companies  textron finance also has contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future 
textron finance generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables 
the contractual payments and receipts as of december  are detailed below payments receipts due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total textron finance contractual payments commercial paper and other short term debt term debt operating leases total contractual payments contractual receipts finance receivables operating leases total contractual receipts cash total cash and contractual receipts net cash and contractual receipts payments cumulative net cash and contractual receipts finance receivable receipts are based on contractual cash flows 
these amounts could differ due to prepayments  charge offs and other factors 
contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges and discounts from receivables  debt interest payments  proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 
as shown in the preceding table  cash collections from finance assets are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities 
at december   textron finance had billion in debt and million in other liabilities that are payable within the next months 
at december   textron finance had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under billion of committed revolving lines of credit  compared with billion at january  since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements textron has joint venture agreements with external financing arrangements for which textron has guaranteed approximately million in debt obligations  including approximately million related to discontinued operations 
textron would be required to make payments under these guarantees if a joint venture defaults under the debt agreements 
bell helicopter and agustawestland north america inc awna formed the agustawestlandbell llc awb llc in january for the joint design  development  manufacture  sale  customer training and product support of the us helicopter  recently designated the vh helicopter  and certain variations and derivatives thereof  to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government 
in march  awb llc received a billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps marine helicopter squadron vh program 
on march   bell helicopter guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract  provided that bell helicopter s liability under the guaranty shall not exceed of awb llc s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract 
agustawestland nv  awna s parent company  has guaranteed the remaining to lockheed martin 
bell helicopter and agustawestland nv have entered into cross indemnification agreements in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party s workshare under any subcontracts received 
for  awb llc s maximum obligation is of the total contract value  which equates to million based on the current contract value of billion 
in  awb llc s maximum obligation increases to  or million  and thereafter increases to  or million 
accordingly  the maximum amount of bell helicopter s liability under the guarantee is million at december  and will be million in and million thereafter through completion 
textron manufacturing enters into a forward contract in textron common stock on an annual basis 
the contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to textron stock 
the forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing textron common stock price 
as of december   the contract was for approximately million shares with a strike price of 
the market price of the stock was at december   resulting in a receivable of million  compared with a receivable of million at january  textron finance sells finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales 
as a result of these transactions  finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet  and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels 
despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position  textron finance generally retains a subordinate interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations  which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 
these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
textron finance utilizes these off balance sheet financing arrangements primarily asset backed securitizations to further diversify funding alternatives 
these arrangements are an important source of funding that provided net proceeds from continuing operations of million and million in and  respectively 
proceeds from securitizations includes proceeds received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and excludes amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these receivables with short durations 
textron finance has used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper 
whole loan finance receivable sales in which textron finance maintains a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred 
limited credit enhancement is typically provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and  to a lesser extent  prepayment risk 
textron finance has a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease rents in and the maximum liability at december  was million 
textron finance has valued this contingent liability based on assumptions for annual credit losses and prepayment rates of and  respectively 
an instantaneous adverse change in these rates would have an insignificant impact on the valuation of this recourse liability 
termination of textron finance s off balance sheet financing arrangements would significantly reduce its short term funding alternatives 
while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require textron finance to repurchase significant balances of receivables previously sold  there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future 
potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality  downgrades in textron finance s debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements 
textron finance does not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on its liquidity or income from continuing operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of textron s financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
receivable and inventory reserves we evaluate the collectibility of our commercial and finance receivables based on a combination of factors 
for larger balance commercial loans  textron finance considers borrower specific information  industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows  as well as the factors reviewed for its homogeneous loan pools 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its short term financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  geographic economic conditions  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts for amounts we estimate to be potentially uncollectible 
receivables are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
for homogeneous loan pools and all other receivables  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on current delinquencies  the characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  the value of underlying collateral  and general economic conditions and trends 
textron finance estimates that its losses will range from to of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool 
finance receivables are written down to the fair value less estimated costs to sell of the related collateral at the earlier of the date when the collateral is repossessed or when no payment has been received for six months unless we deem the receivable collectible 
reserves on certain finance receivables are determined using estimates of related collateral values based on historical recovery rates and current market conditions 
management reviews the market conditions for used equipment and aircraft inventories on a periodic basis 
a deterioration in market conditions resulting in lower recovery rates would result in lower estimated collateral values  increasing the amount of reserves required on related receivables and used inventories on hand 
based on current market conditions and recovery rates  we believe our reserves are adequate as of december  long term contracts we recognize revenue and profit as work on certain government long term engineering  development and production contracts progresses using the contract method of accounting  which relies on estimates of the total contract cost and revenue 
estimated contract cost and revenue are based on current contract specifications  expected engineering requirements and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
contract costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgment 
the cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in net earnings when determinable 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition  while unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized earnings 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
earnings on long term contracts could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to income if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using the estimates from our long term strategic plans 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
within our industrial segment  the fluid handling products component has assumed an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately over the five year planning period driven by anticipated revenue growth of approximately annually along with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts 
a basis point reduction in the estimated operating profit growth rate from those used in our discounted cash flow model to approximately would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately million  and may result in the carrying value of the business exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill allocated to this business totaled approximately million 
securitized transactions securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts 
while the assets sold are no longer on our balance sheet  our retained interests are included in other assets 
we may retain an interest in the transferred assets in the form of interest only securities  seller certificates  cash reserve accounts  and servicing rights and obligations 
our retained interests are subordinate to other investors interests in the securitizations 
generally  we do not provide legal recourse to third party investors that purchase interests in our securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained interest only securities  seller certificates and cash reserve accounts 
we estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future cash flows expected using our best estimates of prepayment speeds  credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
these assumptions are reviewed each quarter  and the retained interests are written down when the carrying value exceeds the fair value based on revised estimates and the decline is estimated to be other than temporary 
based on our sensitivity analysis  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  a adverse change in either the prepayment speed  expected credit losses or the residual cash flows discount rate would not result in a material charge to income 
pension and other postretirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  we have reduced the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense to from in while over the past ten years  returns for the largest pool of managed retirement assets have exceeded  the weighted average expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered to reflect the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets  as well as the change in our investment portfolio mix 
our qualified domestic plans compose over of our total pension obligations 
in  the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans was 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  we decreased our weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to from in for our qualified domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was for a basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for certain pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at december  however  strong asset returns and contributions to the plans reduced the shortfall during accordingly  we recorded a non cash adjustment to shareholders equity for the minimum pension liability of million  net of income taxes  in the fourth quarter of the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rate  which is the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  was 
the medical rate is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate is expected to rise to in  then decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognized future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis

r until the first quarter of textron elected to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized in includes a compensation cost for all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated and recognized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

for awards granted or modified in and prospectively  compensation costs for awards with only service conditions that vest ratably are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
compensation costs for awards granted prior to are recognized using the attribution methods required under sfas no 
upon adoption  textron re measured its share based compensation awards that are accounted for as liabilities at fair value 
the cumulative effect of adoption upon this re measurement resulted in an increase to net income of approximately million in the first quarter of  which is not considered to be material and is recorded in selling and administrative expense 
adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in recognition of stock option costs in the stock option costs are included primarily in selling and administrative expense and totaled approximately million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations in in accordance with the modified prospective method  prior periods have not been restated 
no compensation expense related to stock option grants has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for and  as all of the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
as of december   million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested share based compensation awards subject only to service conditions that has not yet been recognized 
textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years 
as of december   million represents the total compensation cost associated with unvested share based compensation awards subject to performance vesting conditions that has not yet been recognized 
textron expects that this compensation will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years 
sfas no 
r requires that the excess tax benefits received related to stock option exercises be presented as financing cash inflows 
for  million of these excess tax benefits have been presented as cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the valuation of stock options requires numerous assumptions 
textron determines the fair value of each option as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs for the expected volatility of textron s common stock price  expected life of the option and expected dividend yield  among others 
in addition  we estimate the number of options expected to eventually vest 
expected volatility estimates are based on implied volatilities from traded options on textron common stock  historical volatilities and other factors 
textron uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior  adjusted to reflect anticipated increases in expected life

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt 
we continuously monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix  as necessary  based on our evaluation of internal and external factors 
the difference between the rates textron manufacturing received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in  or within the finance segment  a strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities limits our risk to changes in interest rates 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at december   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were million  net of billion of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent and million of interest rate exchange agreements which effectively converted fixed rate finance receivables to a floating rate equivalent 
for textron finance  interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the effect of decreasing interest expense by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold 
for  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from increased revenues by approximately million and decreased segment profit by approximately million 
textron manufacturing manages its exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
during  textron manufacturing primarily used borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures  textron manufacturing also enters into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts are generally used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts  foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately million at the end of and million at the end of quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements  foreign exchange contracts  marketable equity securities and marketable security price forward contracts 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end 
we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a decrease in interest rates  a strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a decrease in the quoted market prices of applicable marketable equity securities
