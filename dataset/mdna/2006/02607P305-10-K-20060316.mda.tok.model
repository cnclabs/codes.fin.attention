overview we are a self administered  self managed maryland real estate investment trust  or reit 
we are focused primarily on acquiring and operating properties leased to regulated financial institutions 
we believe banks will divest of their corporate real estate  in order to enhance operating performance 
we also believe that our contractual relationships  with large national banks  our growing visibility within the banking industry and the flexible acquisition and lease structures we can offer financial institutions positions us for continued growth 
we seek to lease our properties to banks and financial institutions  generally using long term triple net or bond net leases  resulting in stable risk adjusted returns on our capital 
we lease space not occupied by financial institutions to other third party tenants at market terms 
we believe that our competitive advantage over traditional real estate companies is our ability to provide banks and other financial institutions with operational flexibility and the benefits of reduced real estate exposure 
we seek to become the preferred landlord of leading banks and other financial institutions through the development of mutually beneficial relationships and by offering flexible acquisition structures and lease terms 
we believe that financial institutions enjoy our long term relationship oriented business strategy rather than undergoing a competitive  selective bidding process with various real estate companies 
recent transactions involving bank of america  na  wachovia bank  na  citizens financial group  inc and regions financial corporation demonstrate our ability to cultivate and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with leading financial institutions 
as of december   we owned or held leasehold interests in  properties located in states and washington  dc  including bank branches and office buildings  containing an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet 
acquisitions during the year ended december   we acquired interests in properties  containing an aggregate of approximately million square feet  and land parcels  for a total net purchase price of million 
the most significant acquisitions included the purchase of i a three building class a office complex  aggregating more than  square feet on approximately acres  which is the corporate headquarters of fireman s fund insurance company  ii a portfolio of properties from regions bank  aggregating approximately million square feet  iii a portfolio of properties from charter one bank  na  a subsidiary of citizens financial group  inc  aggregating approximately  square feet  and iv three properties  aggregating approximately  square feet  which were developed by koll development  llc and leased to citicorp north america  inc dispositions during the year ended december   we disposed of non core properties  land parcels and leasehold interests aggregating approximately million square feet  for net proceeds of million 
these dispositions resulted in a gain of million  before minority interest 
approximately million square feet was vacant or soon to be vacant at the time of sale 
financings during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from new mortgages  including i debt secured by properties acquired during the year ended december  of million  ii long term financing of million on the portfolio of properties acquired from bank of america  na in october  which was originally financed under our secured credit facility  and iii million refinancing of the mortgage debt on our dana commercial credit portfolio of office properties 
the refinancing of our dana commercial credit portfolio is consistent with our refinancing strategy  which is focused on extending the term of existing debt while selectively reducing or eliminating 
table of contents amortization requirements and increasing internally generated cash flow 
during the year ended december   principal payments aggregated million  including the payment related to the refinancing of mortgage debt on our dana commercial credit portfolio of million  scheduled debt amortization of million and prepayments as a result of property dispositions of million 
during the year ended december   we executed a renewal of our secured credit facility  expanding the maximum available under the facility to million and extending the term to october the outstanding advance on our secured credit facility of million at december  was paid in march  when we received long term financing on the portfolio of properties acquired from bank of america  na in october the outstanding advance of million at december  primarily represents the financing of our regions bank portfolio acquired in june and our leased up bank branches acquired from wachovia bank  na in november second public offering on may   we completed a second public offering of  common shares of beneficial interest at per share 
the aggregate net proceeds from this offering after underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs were approximately million 
the company used the aggregate net proceeds for acquisitions 
portfolio review summarized in the table below are our key portfolio statistics  each of which decreased during the year ended december  these decreases were primarily due to the recapture of scheduled short term space occupied by bank tenants subsequent to recent acquisitions of certain properties and the acquisition of vacant branches purchased under our formulated price contracts in the fourth quarter of over the upcoming periods  we expect that our occupancy will increase through the lease up of core properties and the disposal of non core properties 
however  we expect that other key portfolio metrics will decrease as we lease up core properties to non bank tenants 
december  occupancy base revenue from financial institutions base revenue from tenants rated a or better per standard poor s base revenue from net leases average remaining lease term years includes triple net and bond net leases  as well as other similar leases in which our exposure to operating expenses is capped at the amount that has been  or we expect will be  reached in the near future 
we intend to continue our strategy of acquiring high quality properties through a combination of sale leaseback transactions  specifically tailored transactions  landlord of choice transactions and through our formulated price contracts  and to finance our acquisitions with a combination of equity and debt 
we expect to arrange long term financing on both a secured and unsecured fixed rate basis 
we intend to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships throughout the banking industry  which we expect will lead to further acquisition opportunities 
we will also continue to dispose of non core properties that do not meet our continuing portfolio objectives 
new information system effective january   we implemented a new information system 
as a result  a number of our operational processes and internal control procedures will change to conform to the work flow of the new application 
we anticipate that the new information system and internal control procedures will enhance 
table of contents our current processes and financial reporting structure  however we cannot assure you that this implementation will be executed without some interruption of our operating processes and controls 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting estimates include revenue recognition our revenues  which are derived primarily from rental income  include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straightline basis over the initial term of the lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straightline basis accounting requires us to record a receivable  and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
revenues also include income related to tenant reimbursements for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses that are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
we continually review receivables related to rent  tenant reimbursements and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectibility by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable is in doubt  we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in real estate investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset 
costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of up to years for buildings and improvements  five to ten years for equipment and fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which established a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and properties intended to be sold to be designated as held for sale on the balance sheet 
based on the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
such events or changes in circumstances include the following a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  
table of contents a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we review our portfolio on an on going basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability 
in general  our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends and residual value expected  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
purchase price allocation pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations  we follow the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations 
to ensure that intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase method business combination can be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  we ensure that the applicable criteria specified in sfas no 
are met 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values 
tangible assets include land  buildings  equipment and tenant improvements on an as if vacant basis 
we utilize various estimates  processes and information to determine the as if vacant property value 
estimates of value are made using customary methods  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquired leases for above and below market lease rates  the value of in place leases  and the value of customer relationships 
amounts allocated to land  buildings  equipment and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio 
depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated life of years for buildings  five to ten years for building equipment and fixtures  and the lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements 
above market and below market in place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of intangible assets related to in place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as 
table of contents if vacant 
factors considered by us in our analysis of the in place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up period for each property  taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up period  which typically ranges from six to months 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the aggregate value of intangibles assets related to customer relationship is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant 
characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which range primarily from two to years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
if a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities  in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed 
accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities we use derivatives to hedge  fix and cap interest rate risk and we account for our derivative and hedging activities using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statements in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges under sfas no 
under cash flow hedges  derivative gains and losses not considered highly effective in hedging the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in the income statement 
for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short cut method  at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and the following comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december   makes reference to the following i the effect of the same store  which represents all properties owned by us at january  and still owned by us at december   excluding assets held for sale at december  and ii the effect of acquisitions  which represents all properties acquired during the period from january  through december  acquisitions include state street financial center  harborside  independence center  the wachovia bank  na portfolio acquired in september  the bank of america  na portfolio acquired in october  the national city bank building  bank of america west  one montgomery street  market street  bank of oklahoma plaza  charter one bank portfolio  regions bank portfolio  household  fireman s fund  one citizen plaza  one colonial plaza and properties acquired under our formulated price contracts

table of contents as certain activity in same store portfolios  resulted in an increase to total net operating income of million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  same store net operating income net operating income on the same store increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the following dana commercial credit 
the properties in the dana commercial credit portfolio are primarily occupied by bank of america  na under a single master lease agreement 
this master lease agreement allows bank of america  na to return certain space or retain the space upon payment of additional rent in   and the return of the space does not reduce the amount of bank of america  na s contractual rent obligations 
in june and january  bank of america  na returned in aggregate approximately  square feet 
prior to june  bank of america  na paid rent on the returned space and directly collected the rent from its third party tenants and directly paid operating expenses 
as a result  in june and january  in addition to the income we already receive from bank of america  na for the properties  we also began directly collecting rental income and operating expense reimbursements from subtenants that occupy a portion of the returned space and from bank of america  na for certain space that it decided to retain and directly paying and incurring operating expenses 
these increases to net operating income on the dana commercial credit portfolio were partially offset by lost rental income from a scheduled lease termination by a non bank tenant  which occurred in june the net effect of this returned space and the scheduled lease termination totaled approximately million of additional net operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in rental income in the dana commercial credit portfolio was also related to the correction of straightline rental income 
during the fourth quarter of  the company discovered that rental income was being straightlined through december  six months longer than the actual expiration of june after evaluating the impact of this adjustment  approximately million of additional rental income was recorded during the fourth quarter of in order to adjust deferred straightline rent to the proper balance as of december  formulated price contract 
net operating income on same store also increased as a result of new leases across certain portfolios  particularly properties acquired under our formulated price contracts with wachovia bank  na and citibank 
once branches purchased or assumed under our formulated contracts are leased  the tenant generally directly pays operating expenses under net lease arrangements 
south broad street 
during the year ended december   we recorded an early termination fee of million  which resulted in an increase to other income 
this fee was received in connection with a bank tenant vacating a portion of the space it leased in south broad street in philadelphia 
as a result of this early termination  net operating income  excluding the early termination fee  on our south broad street decreased primarily due to the accelerated amortization of the accounts related to the lease 
bank of america  na portfolio acquired in june during the year ended december   we recorded an early termination fee of million  which resulted in an increase to other income  from a non bank third party tenant 
this early termination was initiated by the tenant due to its financial instability 
in connection with this early termination  we accelerated amortization of straightline rent and intangibles  which resulted in an increase to rental income of million 
three beaver valley 
during the year ended december   we finished construction of an adjacent parking garage and signed a new lease with the tenant effective january   which contributed million to net operating income 

table of contents acquisitions net operating income net operating income on acquisitions increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily relates to the following timing of acquisitions 
the increase in net operating income on acquisitions primarily related to the timing of acquisitions in the year ended december   which included a full year of results for acquisitions purchased in and a partial year of results for acquisitions purchased in the largest effect relates to the september and october purchases of the portfolios of properties from wachovia bank  na and bank of america  na  respectively 
state street financial center 
both the timing of the acquisition of state street financial center in february and the july completion of the lease on the parking garage at state street financial center contributed to the increase in net operating income on acquisitions 
lease up 
net operating income on acquisitions also increased as a result of lease up across certain portfolios  including harborside in jersey city  new jersey and properties acquired under our formulated price contracts 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  professional fees and office and travel related expenses 
these increases were partially offset by the increase in the capitalization of certain leasing related costs 
the decrease of marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   is largely attributable to the increase in rental income and operating expense reimbursements resulting from acquisitions 
broken deal costs broken deal costs increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our policy is to capitalize  as deferred costs  external expenses associated with potential acquisitions 
however  when we make the decision not to pursue transactions that do not meet our investment criteria  the previously capitalized costs are immediately expensed as broken deal costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
the majority of our broken deal costs during both the years ended december  and related to withdrawing from potential transactions associated with our european expansion efforts 
amortization of deferred equity compensation the amortization of deferred equity compensation increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was associated with the amortization of additional restricted stock grants issued during the year ended december  outperformance plan contingent restricted share component during the year ended december   we reversed the previously recorded expense associated with the contingent restricted share component of our outperformance plan 
this expense was reversed due to variable plan accounting treatment as a result of the performance in our stock price relative to the measured index 
the outperformance plan was a three year plan that expired on january  and was succeeded by the long term incentive plan as our long term performance plan for senior executives 

table of contents severance and related accelerated amortization of deferred compensation during the years ended december  and  we incurred severance charges related to the separation of two senior officers and one senior officer  respectively 
these severance charges included the amortization of deferred compensation associated with the acceleration of vesting and additional issuance of restricted stock awards 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense associated with acquisitions as well as the following same store 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in same store was primarily attributable to the correction of useful lives on certain portfolios 
during the year ended december   the company discovered that certain depreciable assets  primarily intangible assets  were being amortized over the improper useful lives 
after evaluating the impact of these adjustments  approximately million of additional depreciation and amortization expense was recorded during the year ended december  in order to adjust accumulated amortization to the proper balances 
since the change shortened useful lives  depreciation and amortization is higher in the year ended december  relative to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in same store was also related to additional capital and tenant improvements across various portfolios and the accelerated amortization of intangibles and tenant improvements related to early lease terminations 
corporate 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in corporate is primarily attributable to leasehold improvements  office furniture and fixtures due to the expansion of our corporate offices as well as equipment associated with our new information system capitalized during the year ended december  interest expense on mortgages and other debt interest expense on mortgage notes and other debt increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings and contractual increases in interest rates  specifically due to the following new borrowings 
during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million under new or assumed mortgages  secured by properties acquired in  which increased interest expense by million 
interest expense increased million due to incurring a full year of interest expense on mortgages secured by properties acquired in and in september the interest rate on the million mortgage note payable secured by state street financial center changed from a variable rate of libor plus to a fixed rate of 
in addition  in march  we completed the million long term financing  secured by the bank of america  na portfolio purchased in october this financing bore interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus through june   before reverting to a fixed rate of for the remainder of the loan term and increased interest expense by million 
secured credit facility 
interest expense on our secured credit facility increased by million 
although average advances under our secured credit facility decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december   the weighted average effective interest rate increased to from 
the advances outstanding at december  of million were drawn in october to partially fund the acquisition of the bank of america  na portfolio 
these funds were repaid in march  when proceeds of million from a long term loan secured by the portfolio were received 
after the repayment in march  the secured 
table of contents credit facility remained unused until funds were drawn to finance a portion of the regions bank portfolio and leased up properties purchased under formulated price contracts during the third and fourth quarters of senior convertible notes 
during the year ended december   we incurred a full year of interest expense associated with our convertible senior notes issued in july and october  which resulted in an increase to interest expense of million 
deferred financing costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred additional non cash interest expense of million related to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs due to the refinancing of the mortgage secured by the dana commercial credit portfolio 
during the year ended december   we also incurred additional non cash interest expense associated with the change in the amortization method of deferred financing costs from the straightline to effective interest method 
this change in methodology resulted in an increase in non cash interest expense of million to adjust accumulated amortization to the proper balance at december  variable to fixed changes in interest rates 
the million mortgage secured by bank of america plaza completed in april  converted from a variable rate of libor plus in june to a fixed rate of in july debt amortization and extinguishment 
these increases in interest expense are partially offset by contractual debt amortization of million during the year ended december  and the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million due to the disposition of the underlying properties 
gain on sale of land and minority interest in a property  net during the year ended december   we sold five parcels of land acquired in november under our formulated price contract with wachovia bank  na for a net gain of million 
the net gain recorded during the year ended december   primarily relates to the sale of a interest in state street financial center for a net gain of million 
net loss on investments net loss on investments increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a loss incurred on the sale of certain marketable securities 
we do not hold a position in such securities as of december  minority interest minority interest increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this amount represents an allocation of net loss to unitholders in our operating partnership and an allocation of net income or loss from our south broad street  state street financial center and market street properties to third parties that own a minority interest in those properties 
we sold a minority interest in state street financial center in december and acquired an majority interest in market street in april  therefore  little or no allocations to minority interest were recorded on these properties during the year ended december  on october   the company acquired the remaining limited partnership interest in the entity that owned s 
broad street in philadelphia  pa 
therefore  allocations of minority interest on south broad ceased after october  discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations increased million to a loss of million  net of minority interest  for the year ended december   from a loss of million  net of minority interest  for the year ended december  the properties included in discontinued operations generated approximately million more in net loss during the year ended december  compared to the 
table of contents same period in  primarily due to interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
a majority of the properties sold or held for sale at december  were acquired in or in the fourth quarter of and therefore only contributed a partial year of losses to the year ended december   if at all 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in impairment charges during the year ended december  compared to the same period in discontinued operations yield maintenance fees during the year ended december   we sold seven properties encumbered by a mortgage and incurred related charges on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  net of minority interest 
in comparison  during the year ended december   we sold three properties encumbered by mortgages and incurred related charges on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  net of minority interest 
discontinued operations net gains during the year ended december  and  we sold and properties for a gain of million and million  net of minority interest and income taxes  respectively 
we have established investment criteria for properties included in our real estate portfolio and a policy to dispose of non core properties that do not meet such criteria

table of contents net operating income total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  property operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these increases  which are largely attributable to acquisitions as well as certain activity in same store portfolios  resulted in an increase to total net operating income of million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  same store net operating income net operating income on the same store increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the lease up of properties acquired from wachovia bank  na under our formulated price contracts 
acquisitions net operating income net operating income on acquisitions increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily related to the following timing of acquisitions 
the primary reason for the increase in net operating income on acquisitions related to the timing of acquisitions in that the year ended december  included a full year of results for acquisitions purchased in and a partial year of results for acquisitions purchased in the largest effect relates to the september purchase of a portfolio of properties from wachovia bank  na and the june and october purchases of portfolios of properties from and bank of america  na dana commercial credit 
in addition to the effect of the timing of the acquisition of the dana commercial credit portfolio  which occurred in january  net operating income on the dana commercial credit portfolio increased due to the change in lease arrangement in some of the properties from bond net terms to net lease terms 
the properties in this portfolio are primarily occupied by bank of america  na under a single master lease agreement 
this master lease agreement allows bank of america  na to return certain space or retain the space upon payment of additional rent in   and the return of the space does not reduce the amount of bank of america  na s contractual rent obligations 
in june and january  bank of america  na returned in aggregate approximately  square feet 
prior to june  bank of america  na paid rent on the returned space and directly collected the rent from its third party tenants and directly paid operating expenses 
as a result  in june and january  in addition to the income we already receive from bank of america  na for the properties  we also began directly collecting rental income and operating expense reimbursements from subtenants that occupy a portion of the returned space and from bank of america  na for certain space that it decided to retain and directly paying and incurring operating expenses 
as a result of this change  net operating income on the dana commercial credit portfolio increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily related to additional compensation and related benefits resulting from the increased number of employees required to operate a public company and to manage a substantially increased number of properties 
the increase was also attributable to an additional million of initial costs associated with the investigation of european expansion opportunities  trustees and officer s insurance premiums  marketing and travel related expenses and professional fees 
the decrease of marketing  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to for the year ended december  
table of contents  from for the year ended december   was largely attributable to the increase in rental income and operating expense reimbursements resulting from acquisitions 
broken deal costs during the year ended december   we incurred broken deal costs of million 
no such costs were incurred during the year ended december  our policy is to capitalize  as deferred costs  external expenses associated with potential acquisitions 
however  once a decision is made not to pursue transactions that do not meet our investment criteria  the previously capitalized costs are immediately expensed as broken deal costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
the majority of our broken deal costs during the year ended december  related to withdrawing from potential transactions associated with our european expansion efforts 
amortization of deferred equity compensation the amortization of deferred equity compensation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the amortization for the year ended december  included the expense associated with awards granted in and  whereas amortization for the year ended december  only includes awards granted in  most of which were not granted until july outperformance plan cash and contingent restricted share components during the year ended december   we recorded an expense associated with the cash and contingent restricted share components of our outperformance plan of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we reversed the previously recorded expense associated with the contingent restricted share component of our outperformance plan  all of which was recorded during the year ended december  this expense was reversed due to variable plan accounting treatment as a result of the performance in our stock price relative to the measured index 
the outperformance plan was a three year plan that expired on january  and was succeeded by the long term incentive plan as our long term performance plan for senior executives 
severance and related accelerated amortization of deferred compensation during the year ended december   we incurred severance charges related to the separation of one senior officer 
these severance charges included the amortization of deferred compensation associated with the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards 
no such expense was incurred during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense associated with acquisitions 
same store 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in same store was primarily attributable to additional capital and tenant improvements 
corporate 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in corporate was primarily attributable to leasehold improvements and office furniture and fixtures 
interest expense on mortgages and other debt interest expense on mortgage notes and other debt increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended 
table of contents december  this increase was primarily attributable to additional borrowings and contractual increases in interest rates  specifically due to the following new borrowings 
during the year ended december   interest expense increased by million as a result of new debt  secured by properties acquired during the year ended december  and a full year of interest expense on debt secured by properties acquired during the year ended december  the increase included variable to fixed rate interest rate changes described below 
variable to fixed changes in interest rates 
the million mortgage secured by bank of america plaza completed in april  converted from a variable rate of libor plus in june to a fixed rate of in july in december  the interest rate on mortgages encumbered by properties in our bank of america  na portfolio acquired in june reverted from a variable rate of libor plus to a fixed rate of 
in april and may  interest rates on mortgages secured by our pitney bowes wachovia and dana commercial credit portfolios reverted from a variable rate of libor plus for both loans to a fixed rate of and  respectively 
in september  the interest rate on the million mortgage note payable secured by state street financial center changed from a variable rate of libor plus in august to a fixed rate of secured credit facility 
during the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of million related to advances under our secured credit facility to fund acquisitions 
we did not have any advances under this facility during the year ended december  senior convertible note 
during the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of million associated with our convertible senior notes issued in july and october no such expense was incurred during the year ended december  debt amortization 
these increases in interest expense are partially offset by the effect of contractual debt amortization of million  which occurred during the year ended december  gain on sale of land and minority interest in a property  net the net gain recorded during the year ended december   primarily relates to the sale of a interest in state street financial center for a net gain of million 
loss on investments loss on investments was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a loss incurred on the sale of investments in our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio during the year ended december  our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities was sold in the second quarter of net interest income on residential mortgage backed securities  net of expenses during the year ended december   net interest income from our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio was approximately million 
we did not have any net interest income from residential mortgage backed securities during the year ended december  because on may   our board of trustees approved the sale of all remaining residential mortgage backed securities in our portfolio  the repayment of all borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements used to finance the portfolio and the termination of a related hedging agreement 
these transactions were completed during the second quarter of minority interest minority interest decreased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  this amount represents an allocation of net loss to unitholders in our operating partnership and an allocation of net income or loss from our south broad street and state street financial center properties to 
table of contents individuals who own an and interest in the entities that own those properties  respectively 
we sold a minority interest in state street financial center in december  therefore  no allocations to minority interest was recorded on this property during the year ended december  discontinued operations loss from operations 
loss from discontinued operations increased approximately million to a loss of approximately million  net of minority interest for the year ended december   from a loss of approximately million  net of minority interest for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to impairment charges on properties sold of approximately million during the year ended december   compared to approximately million during the year ended december  excluding impairment charges  the properties included in discontinued operations generated approximately million of additional net loss during the year ended december  compared to the same period in discontinued operations yield maintenance fees 
during the year ended december   we sold three properties encumbered by mortgages and incurred related charges on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  net of minority interest 
we did not incur charges related to the early extinguishment of debt  during the year ended december  discontinued operations net gains 
during the year ended december  and  we sold and properties for a gain  net of minority interest and income taxes  of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have established investment criteria for properties included in our real estate portfolio and a policy to dispose of non core properties that do not meet such criteria 
pursuant to our policy  we generally intend to commence efforts to dispose of non core properties within days of acquisition and dispose of them within approximately months of acquisition 
if we sell properties at a gain  we may incur an income tax liability on such gains 
cash flows for the year ended december  during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the level of cash flows provided by operating activities is affected by the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the timing of the payment of operating and interest expenses 
the increase in deferred revenue is due to the prepayment of contractual rent payments received from bank of america  na for the dana commercial credit portfolio that apply to future periods  sublease management and standby subtenant fees related to our leasehold interest in harborside and prepaid rent related to properties we did not own on december  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million 
investing activities consisted primarily of payments for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of approximately million and approximately million for payments related to capital expenditures and leasehold termination costs 
payments for capital expenditures and leasehold termination costs include million of non real estate capital expenditures  million of tenant improvements  million of completed building improvements and equipment projects  million of construction in progress and million of termination costs 
payments for completed building improvements and equipment include approximately million of the pro rata share of these costs that will be reimbursed with interest by our bank tenants over the useful life of the assets 
these payments were partially offset by net sales of marketable securities of approximately million and proceeds from sales of real estate and non real estate investments and payments received to assume leasehold interests of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million 
financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from mortgage notes payable  convertible senior notes and credit facilities of approximately  million  which were used principally to finance properties acquired in and 
table of contents the bank of america  na portfolio purchased in we also received approximately million of proceeds from our secondary offering in may and the exercise of stock options and million of contributions from the minority interest owners of state street financial center 
these proceeds were partially offset by i dividends to shareholders and distributions to operating partnership unitholders of approximately million  ii repayment of mortgage notes payable and payment of financing costs of approximately million  iii approximately million of payments to redeem operating partnership units issued in connection with the acquisition of state street financial center and iv approximately million related to an increase in restricted cash 
cash flows for the year ended december  during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the level of cash flows provided by operating activities was affected by the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the timing of the payment of operating and interest expenses 
the increase in deferred leasing costs was primarily related to the lease inducement fee paid to a subsidiary of state street corporation  the tenant in state street financial center  and a lease extension fee paid to bank of america  na  a tenant in independence center 
these increases were partially offset by the increase in deferred revenue 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to the prepayment of contractual rent payments received from bank of america  na for the dana commercial credit portfolio that apply to future periods  sublease management and standby subtenant fees related to our leasehold interest in harborside and prepaid rent related to properties we did not own on december   including state street financial center and the portfolios we purchased from wachovia bank  na in september and bank of america  na in october net cash used in investing activities was approximately  million 
investing activities consisted primarily of payments for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of approximately  million  principally for the acquisition of state street financial center  fremont street  independence center  and the wachovia bank  na and bank of america  na portfolios  and approximately million for payments related to capital expenditures and leasehold termination costs 
these payments were partially offset by net sales of marketable securities of approximately million  proceeds from sales of real estate and non real estate investments and payments received to assume leasehold interests of approximately million and net proceeds from the sale of a interest in state street financial center of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  million 
financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from mortgage notes payable  convertible senior notes and credit facilities of approximately  million  which were used principally to finance a portion of the purchase price of state street financial center  fremont street  and the wachovia bank  na and bank of america  na portfolios and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately million 
these proceeds were partially offset by i dividends to shareholders and distributions to operating partnership unitholders of approximately million  ii repayment of mortgage notes payable and payment of financing costs of approximately million  iii approximately million of payments to redeem operating partnership units issued in connection with the acquisition of state street financial center  and iv approximately million related to an increase in restricted cash 
cash flows for the year ended december  during the year ended december   net cash provided from operating activities was approximately million 
the level of cash flows provided by operating activities is affected by the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the timing of the payment of operating and interest expenses 
in january  we received a rental payment of approximately million from bank of america  na under the terms of a lease we assumed in the acquisition of a portfolio of office buildings and two parking facilities from a wholly owned subsidiary of dana commercial credit corporation 

table of contents net cash used for investing activities was approximately million  and included i sales of residential mortgage backed securities of approximately million  ii receipt of principal payments on residential mortgage backed securities of approximately million  iii net sales of marketable investments of approximately million  iv acquisitions of real estate investments  net of proceeds on sales of real estate investments  of approximately  million  v a decrease in accrued interest income of million and vi capital expenditures of approximately million

liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity requirements we had an aggregate of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  on may   we completed a public offering of  common shares and received proceeds of approximately million  which were deployed in their entirety to complete acquisitions previously identified in that offering s prospectus or additional acquisitions identified after the completion of the offering 
based on the collateral pool of assets pledged on our secured credit facility at december   we had approximately million of immediately available funds and had drawn million of advances  resulting in a net immediate availability of million 
we also had million of additional  uncollateralized availability under this facility 
in addition to our secured credit facility  we have an unsecured credit facility with a million borrowing limit  available for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the unsecured facility  resulting in a net availability of million 
as of december   total availability under both our secured and unsecured credit facilities was approximately million  excluding additional collateral that could be pledged under the secured credit facility of million 
as of february   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this decrease during the period from december  to february  primarily relates to our dividend payment of million  the interest payment on our senior convertible notes of million and acquisitions under our formulated price contracts of million 
these cash payments were partially offset by the receipt of the annual rent payment of million related to the dana commercial credit portfolio 
since we completed the refinancing of the mortgage debt on our dana commercial credit portfolio of office properties in december to a non amortizing mortgage  we were not required to pay the january principal payment under the original loan terms of approximately million 
in addition to eliminating principal amortization requirements  the refinancing extended the term of the mortgage from approximately five years to twelve years with an increase in the debt balance from approximately million to the refinanced amount of million 
the interest rate also increased from to as a result of this refinancing 
completion of the refinancing of this portfolio is consistent with our announced refinancing strategy  which is focused on extending the term of existing debt  while selectively reducing or eliminating amortization requirements  and increasing internally generated cash flow 
as of december   we had approximately million in pending acquisitions under contract or letters of intent  excluding acquisitions pending under our formulated price contracts 
the most significant of these pending acquisitions was a portfolio of properties  which we acquired from national city corporation in march for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction 
table of contents related expenses 
we anticipate that these acquisitions will be partially funded from our secured credit facility with an advance of million 
our contracts and letters of intent to acquire the proposed acquisitions are subject to various closing conditions  including the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation regarding the properties to be acquired  and there can be no assurance as to when  or if  any or all of the proposed acquisitions will be consummated 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the acquisitions we are currently negotiating will result in contracts and or will be consummated 
as of december   we also had approximately million in pending acquisitions under outstanding notifications and notifications we anticipate receiving under our formulated price contracts 
pursuant to our formulated price contracts  we acquire  or assume leasehold interests in  the surplus bank branches of financial institutions at a formulated price established by independent appraisals 
at march   we were still in due diligence periods and had not received appraisals for all the properties for which we received or anticipate receiving notice 
therefore  where possible and quantifiable  we have estimated the purchase price of the properties we anticipate acquiring  based on the appraisals we have received for similar properties 
the acquisition of these properties will be principally financed with cash available from operations  proceeds from dispositions and advances from our secured credit facility collateralized by other existing properties in our portfolio 
we anticipate receiving advances from our secured credit facility of approximately million to fund these acquisitions 
in march  we anticipate receiving proceeds from selling non core properties of approximately million  net of principal payments on related debt 
these dispositions include properties we anticipate acquiring in march and selling soon after acquisition 
we also anticipate receiving an additional million in proceeds  net of principal payments on related debt  from the sale of other non core properties in the second quarter of we cannot assure that we will successfully close these dispositions 
if such properties are not sold or not sold in a timely manner  our liquidity position could be adversely affected 
in february  we entered into an agreement with resnick development corp 
to sell five occupied properties  which aggregate approximately million square feet  for approximately million  before transaction and closing costs  and net of approximately million in loan defeasance and prepayment costs that will be paid or reimbursed by the purchaser at closing 
we anticipate that this transaction will be completed in april  at which time  after debt principal payments  defeasance and other closing costs  we anticipate receiving proceeds from this sale of approximately million 
as of december   we had formulated price contracts with banking institutions  including contracts with three of the six largest depositary institutions in the united states 
unless terminated  our formulated price contracts automatically renew on an annual basis 
since our formulated price agreements require us  with limited exceptions  to purchase all bank branches  subject to notification  that the counter parties determine to be surplus properties  the total contractual obligation under these agreements is not quantifiable 
if we are unable to accurately forecast the number of properties that we may become obligated to purchase  or if we are unable to secure adequate debt or equity financing to fund the purchase price  we may not have sufficient capital to purchase these properties 
if we cannot perform our obligations  we may become subject to liquidated or other damages or impair our relationships with these institutions 
the institutions with which we have such agreements may also have the right to terminate the agreements if we breach our obligations under them 
any of these damages could significantly affect our operating results  and if these agreements are terminated  our ability to acquire additional properties and successfully execute our business plan 
if we are successful in entering into similar agreements with other financial institutions  we may need a significant amount of additional capital to fund additional acquisitions under those agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise necessary capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to fund required acquisitions would adversely affect our revenues  impair our business plan and reduce cash available for distribution to shareholders 
under a long term triple net lease agreement with one of our tenants  we have agreed to allow the tenant to obtain leasehold financing once the tenant is able to obtain certain regulatory approval to conduct its business 
the previously vacant property that the tenant leases is presently securitized along with other properties included in our bank of america  na portfolio acquired in june the tenant s financing 
table of contents arrangements  will require us to extinguish the debt and pay approximately million to release this property from the securitization 
we expect this release to occur during the second quarter of on june   the short term bridge facility initially received in anticipation of completing a pooled securitization financing  secured by bank of oklahoma plaza  one citizens plaza and one colonial plaza  will expire at which time this million facility must be renewed or repaid 
we anticipate that the pooled securitization financing will be completed before the short term bridge facility expires  however we cannot assure you that the timing will not be delayed by unforeseen circumstances and that we will be able to renew or raise the necessary funds to meet our obligations 
in december  we satisfied all post closing requirements related to the short term bridge facility 
the portion of the short term bridge facility secured by bank of oklahoma plaza and one citizens plaza was initially full recourse to our operating partnership 
the recourse decreased from approximately million to approximately million  when the post closing requirements were satisfied 
we anticipate that the pooled securitization financing will refinance bank of oklahoma plaza  one citizens plaza and one colonial plaza as well as a multitude of other assets 
after debt payments and defeasance costs  we anticipate receiving net proceeds from the pooled securitization financing in the range of approximately million to million 
our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses  contractually obligated reimbursable and non reimbursable capital expenditures  dividend and distribution payments to our shareholders and unitholders  respectively  debt service  inclusive of principal repayment and interest expense related to both secured and unsecured debt and commitments to complete pending acquisitions 
although cash flow from real estate operating activity is a source from which these payments are provided  with the exception of acquisitions  it alone is not sufficient to meet these obligations 
in addition to cash flow from real estate operating activity and cash available from our credit facilities  we expect to fund short term liquidity requirements from any or all of the following sources proceeds from the sale of non core real estate assets  proceeds from the sale of interests in existing real property assets contributed to and maintained or re developed through off balance sheet entities to be formed with unrelated third party investors  the placement of mortgage financings on existing unencumbered assets  the placement of mortgage financings to refinance existing encumbered assets  and the issuance of secured or unsecured debt securities 
however  if these sources of funds become unavailable  our access to the capital markets becomes restricted or we are unable to match the completion of capital sourcing transactions with capital needs  our ability to meet our short term liquidity requirements will be adversely affected 
long term liquidity requirements our long term requirements generally consist of real property investments  the refinancing of existing long term debt obligations  which may come due in the next months  as well as the repayment of balances outstanding on our credit facilities 
these investments and refinancing requirements may be funded utilizing capital market transactions  which may include the issuance of preferred equity  common equity and various forms of secured and unsecured long term debt instruments 
such financings may also be funded through short term bank loans and long term mortgages 
in addition  we are actively managing our debt and capital position 
we are currently reviewing our debt portfolio  in order to identify and refinance obligations with high interest rate coupons or high debt service constants 
through these refinancings  we anticipate improved cash flow by decreasing interest payment obligations or eliminating or reducing debt amortization 
we are also looking to extend the term of certain debt to balance future refinancing requirements 
we expect to continue to acquire additional properties in the next months 
we expect to fund current acquisition commitments and future commitments with any or all of the sources of capital described above 
we intend to arrange debt in accordance with our general borrowing policies  which 
table of contents include utilizing our credit facilities prior to securing permanent debt financing and or obtaining short term floating rate bridge financings to expedite the closing of such acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from real estate operating activity and access to the capital markets is sufficient to meet our short term and long term capital requirements 
however  if these sources of funds become unavailable or our access to the capital markets becomes restricted  our ability to meet current dividend and other cash payment requirements will be adversely affected 
our properties are encumbered by mortgages and other financing agreements aggregating approximately  million in outstanding principal  excluding unamortized premiums and discounts  as of december   with an average remaining term of years and a weighted average interest rate excluding unamortized debt premium and discounts and the effects of hedging activities of 
during the year ending december   we are required to pay million in debt service  which includes million under our short term bridge facility which we expect to refinance from a pooled securitization in the second quarter of  million of other balloon payments and million of contractual debt amortization

table of contents our indebtedness contains various financial and non financial covenants customarily found in financing arrangements  including debt service coverage ratio requirements and in the case of our unsecured credit facility  limitations on our total indebtedness and our total secured indebtedness 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all of these covenants

includes approximately million for a portfolio of properties  which we acquired in march from national city corporation  other properties aggregating million and approximately million related to notifications outstanding and notifications we anticipate receiving under our formulated price contracts 
however  since our formulated price agreements require us  with limited exceptions  to purchase all bank branches  subject to notification  that the counter parties determine to be surplus properties  the total contractual obligation under these agreements is not quantifiable 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
we have provided charles schwab co  inc with an irrevocable  standby letter of credit for million as security for our obligation under a subtenant agreement and a sublease management and standby subtenant agreement at harborside plaza in jersey city  new jersey 
the amount of the letter of credit will increase concurrently with each rent credit and sublease management fee paid to us by charles schwab co  inc up to million and then decrease over the term of our obligations through october in connection with various reserve requirements for our long term financing of the bank of america  na portfolio we acquired in october  we posted a million letter of credit as collateral 
this letter of credit may be reduced when certain conditions are met  including various leasing and maintenance requirements 
we also provided bank of america  na with an irrevocable  standby letter of credit for million  as security for our obligations under our lease agreements related to the properties we acquired from bank of america  na in june and october the remaining letters of credit were primarily issued to secure payments under leasehold interests and issued to utility companies in lieu of a cash security deposit to establish service 
in addition  the company has million in surety bonds outstanding as of december  issued to utility companies in lieu of a cash security deposit to establish service 
we generally intend to refinance the remaining principal balance of our mortgage notes payable as they become due or repay them if the respective property is sold 
inflation some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions 
in addition  our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of the amortized cost of capital expenditures with interest as well as operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance 
this may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings 
to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured financings  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps  caps  and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   our debt included fixed rate debt  including debt secured by assets held for sale  with a carrying value of approximately  million and a fair value of approximately  million 
changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow 
for instance  if interest rates rise basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant  we expect the fair value of our debt to decrease  the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise 
the sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
as of december   our debt included variable rate mortgage notes payable with a carrying value of million 
the sensitivity analysis related to our variable rate debt assumes an immediate basis point move in variable interest rates with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable notes payable would increase or decrease our interest expense by approximately million annually 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs  and  assumes no other changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date 
the information represented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures  hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations
