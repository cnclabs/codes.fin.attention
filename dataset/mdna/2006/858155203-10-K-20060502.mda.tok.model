item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
north america segment our north america segment serves customers mainly through independent and company owned dealers in over locations in the united states and canada 
each of our dealers maintains their own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with the dealers throughout the sales process 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our segment revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a material effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market due to financial failure or the inability to smoothly transition ownership could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
from time to time  we obtain a controlling interest in dealers that are undergoing an ownership transition 
it is typically our intent to sell these dealerships as soon as it is practical 
our offerings in the north america segment include furniture  architecture  and technology products  as described above  under the steelcase and turnstone brands 
in  the north america segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and at the end of the year had approximately  permanent employees and  temporary workers  of which  of the total workers relate to manufacturing 
the north america office furniture markets are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
in these markets  companies compete on price  delivery and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most significant competitors in the united states are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc  and knoll  inc 
together with steelcase  these companies represent approximately of the united states office furniture market 
steelcase design partnership segment the sdp segment is comprised of five brands focused on higher end design furniture products and niche applications 
each brand has its own competitors which are generally focused on a small group of specialized products 
designtex is focused on surface materials including textiles  wall covering  shades  screens and surface imaging 
details designs and markets computer support and ergonomic tools and accessories for the workplace 
brayton  vecta  and metro each provide different furniture products  including solutions for lobby and reception areas  conference rooms  private offices  health care and learning environments 
the sdp segment markets and sells its products through many of the same dealers as the north america segment 
in  the sdp segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and at the end of the year had approximately  permanent employees and temporary workers  of which of the total workers relate to manufacturing 
international segment our international segment serves customers outside of the united states and canada primarily under the steelcase and sdp brands 
the international office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many different local or regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in most cases  these competitors focus their strengths on selected product categories 
the international segment has its greatest presence in europe where we have the leading market share 
the international segment serves customers through independent and company owned dealers in about locations 
in certain geographic markets the segment sells directly to customers 
in  our international segment accounted for  or of our total revenue and at the end of the year had approximately  permanent employees and temporary workers  and approximately  of the total workers relate to manufacturing 
other category the other category currently includes our polyvision  ideo and steelcase financial services subsidiaries and unallocated corporate expenses 
polyvision designs and manufactures visual communications products  such as static and electronic whiteboards 
the majority of polyvision s revenue relates to static whiteboards in the primary and secondary education markets 
polyvision primarily sells to general contractors through a direct bid process 
polyvision s remaining revenues are generated from electronic whiteboards and group communication tools sold through our north america dealer network and other audio visual resellers 
ideo provides product design and innovation services to companies in a variety of industries including communications  consumer products  healthcare  information technology and manufacturing among others 
steelcase financial services provides leasing services to north america and sdp customers and selected financing services to our dealers 
approximately of corporate expenses for shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated expenses are reported within the other category 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our total revenue 
joint ventures we enter into joint ventures from time to time to expand our geographic presence or support our distribution network 
at february   our investment in joint ventures was our portion of the income or loss from the joint ventures is recorded in other income  net  in the consolidated statements of income 
our primary joint ventures include steelcase jeraisy we own of this office furniture manufacturer in saudi arabia that serves customers primarily in the saudi market 
workstage we own of this us based company that designs and constructs buildings that focus on the integration of the three core elements of the work environment architecture  furniture and technology 
ksm we own of this japanese office furniture manufacturer that supports our distribution in the japanese market 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue in and our five largest direct sale customers accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies and other entities purchasing under our general services administration contract  which in the aggregate accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics historically  each of our segments  and in some cases  brands within segments  had their own dedicated manufacturing facilities 
in many cases  these plants were highly vertically integrated which helped us maintain control over our make to order system 
we invested in automation which improved labor productivity but also resulted in a relatively capital intensive operation with significant work in process inventories because of a batch and queue approach 
over the last several years  we have been migrating to a different industrial model based on lean principles which emphasize continuous one piece flow and discourage batch and queue 
moving to this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  reduced inventories  and reduced the amount of floor space we need to produce products 
the recent industry downturn along with the migration to lean manufacturing created significant excess manufacturing capacity which we have been reducing over the last few years 
at the end of  we had approximately million square feet of manufacturing facilities worldwide 
during fiscal years to  we have undergone significant restructuring driven by the need to reduce our excess capacity in response to lower industry demand 
at the end of  we had reduced our square footage dedicated to manufacturing by approximately million square feet to approximately million square feet 
we currently manufacture and distribute our products in principal locations throughout the world 
see item properties for additional information regarding real estate held for sale and idle property 
we will continue to examine opportunities to consolidate our manufacturing and distribution operations and dispose of assets that represent excess capacity 
the increased breadth of our product line over the last years has increased the number of parts and manufacturing stock keeping units skus  which has increased the complexity and cost of many of our manufacturing operations 
the company launched an initiative in to utilize more common part platforms  streamline our product offerings and increase sales volume per sku to reduce complexity in our industrial system 
during  we implemented projects to simplify large case manufacturing and panel manufacturing and we expect to continue to implement additional projects during we are continuing to create a more flexible industrial model one that moves away from facilities dedicated to manufacturing for a single or limited number of geographic locations and towards a global network of manufacturing  assembly and logistics operations with a global network of integrated suppliers that can serve customer needs across multiple brands and geographies 
in  we centralized our global manufacturing under a single organization to help achieve this goal 
this change had no impact on how our operating results are reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 
our physical distribution system in north america and europe utilizes both our company owned trucking fleet and commercial transport and delivery services 
in north america  we are in the process of establishing a number of regional distribution centers throughout the united states to improve service to customers and dealers and reduce freight cost throughout the value stream 
raw materials and suppliers the company s manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within north america  europe and asia 
to date  we have not experienced difficulties obtaining raw materials  which include steel and other metals  wood  paper  paint  plastics  acoustical materials  foam  laminates  particleboard  veneers  glass  fabrics  leathers and upholstery filling material 
these raw materials are not unique to our industry nor are they rare 
certain commodity prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in the global supply and demand 
there is some risk that these changes could lead to higher than expected costs or future supply interruptions although we do not expect nor have we experienced any such interruptions to date 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of raw materials prices 
research  design and development steelcase s extensive research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated network analysis has helped the company develop unique expertise in helping people work more effectively 
we team up with other innovators leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs 
our design teams develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions are sometimes single products and or enhancements to existing products  and are sometimes integrated architecture  furniture and technology solutions 
design work is organizationally distributed across our major businesses and can involve outside design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
next  designers work closely with our engineers and outside suppliers to co develop products and processes that lead to more efficient manufacturing while incorporating innovative user features 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we have invested in research  design and development activities over the past three years 
royalties are sometimes paid to outside designers of our products as the products are sold and are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable  based on product sales 
the company continues to invest approximately two percent of its revenue in research and development each year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding research  design and development costs 
intellectual property steelcase s commitment to research and development has resulted in our being awarded more us design and utility patents than any other manufacturer in our industry 
currently  steelcase holds approximately active us design and utility patents for current and anticipated products  and approximately patents in other countries 
the average remaining life of the utility patents in our united states portfolio is approximately years 
we have also registered various trademarks and service marks in the united states and other countries 
collectively  we hold registrations for approximately united states and  foreign trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our affiliates 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
for example  our leap seating technology has been licensed for use in automotive and aircraft seating  and we are pursuing other licensing opportunities for this technology 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks  or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the brayton  designtex  details  ideo  leap  metro  polyvision  steelcase  turnstone and vecta trademarks 
working capital our receivables are primarily from our dealers  and to a lesser degree  direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america and sdp segments  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment by offering a discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
in we changed the terms for our north america and sdp segments to encourage faster payment 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within four to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
under certain environmental laws  steelcase could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
steelcase is a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  other financially viable potentially responsible parties and the total estimated cleanup costs  we do not believe that the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations and or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing towards cleanup costs 
employees as of february   steelcase had approximately  permanent employees including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  steelcase had  temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
internationally  a significant number of employees are covered by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management believes that we continue to maintain strong relations with our employees

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows  and financial condition 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our efforts to restructure our industrial model may not be successful 
over the last several years  we have been migrating to a more flexible industrial model based on lean manufacturing principles and a simpler product portfolio 
we also began to adopt a global supply chain 
these strategies have led to restructuring of our manufacturing operations in our north america and international segments 
the restructuring of our manufacturing operations has involved actions such as workforce reductions  facility rationalizations and the disposition of excess assets  including real estate 
the cost of these actions has had the effect of reducing our recent earnings until expected cost savings are achieved 
it is likely that these kinds of actions will continue to be necessary as we pursue with our strategy 
it is possible the scope of our restructuring efforts and the related costs will be higher than we currently anticipate 
the success of our restructuring initiatives is dependent on several factors  including our ability to manage facility consolidation without disrupting existing customer commitments  efficient implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  simplifying our product portfolio  establishing cost effective regional distribution centers  and implementing global sourcing and supply chain initiatives 
such actions may not be accomplished as quickly and effectively as anticipated  and we may not realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities  either of which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy 
our growth strategy calls for expansion in existing markets by leveraging our existing distribution to more fully serve existing customers and to win new customers  and new adjacent markets such as the mid market segment of the office furniture market  vertical markets such as healthcare and education and emerging international markets 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to deliver to our customers a great experience  which includes innovative  well made products and world class processes 
our success will rely in part on our research and development and engineering efforts  our ability to manufacture or source the products  and customer acceptance of our products 
as it relates to new markets  our success will also depend on our ability to create and implement distribution strategies to reach these markets 
our inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
our efforts to grow our business in emerging markets include the risk factors listed below relating to our global operations  but can also include other risks 
in certain markets in asia and eastern europe where we are expanding our business  the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and to protect our investments or sell our investments in the future 
as we hire new people and establish new processes in these locations  we will implement our global business standards  but there is some risk our activities could expose us to liabilities 
we also make investments in new business development initiatives which  like most startups  have a high failure rate 
we limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks  but losses could result and may be material 
in the past  we have also made minority investments in external startup companies and we continue to hold some of these investments 
while we have established reserves related to these investments  it is possible these companies will not be successful or that it will be difficult for us to sell our investment 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  price  lead time  delivery and service  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors  and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
in north america  our top competitors in our primary markets are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc 
and knoll  inc some of our competitors have lower cost structures and a broader offering of moderately priced products  making it more difficult for us to compete in certain customer segments 
in addition  such competition may prevent us from maintaining or raising the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures 
although we do not have major offshore competitors in our north america segment  there are other segments of the north america furniture industry  notably the residential furniture and made to stock office furniture segments  where lower cost imports have become dominant 
it is possible we could see increased competition from imports in our core markets 
in international markets  we tend to compete against a larger number of smaller size competitors 
most of our top competitors have strong relationships with their existing customers that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders 
these competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and can develop products that could have a competitive advantage over steelcase products 
in certain markets  we compete using an import model which requires longer lead times than local competitors with domestic supply chains 
our continued success will depend upon many things  including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality  high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to evolve our business model and implement world class processes to enable us to effectively compete in the office furniture industry s increasingly competitive environment 
our success is also dependent on our ability to sustain our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brand and our trademarks effectively as we enter new markets 
a downturn in the cyclical office furniture industry could adversely impact our revenues and profits 
office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of cyclical macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  white collar employment growth and commercial office construction 
our product sales are directly tied to corporate spending which is outside of our control 
geopolitical uncertainties  terrorist attacks  acts of war  natural disasters  and other world events or combinations of such and other factors that are outside of our control could also have a significant effect on business confidence  the global economy  and therefore  our business 
the global office furniture industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years which dramatically impacted our profitability because of the high level of fixed costs associated with our business 
if another economic or industry downturn occurred in a similar magnitude as experienced during recent years  we may not be able to react fast enough to counteract the decline which could negatively impact our operating results  financial condition and access to capital 
other influences on our industry include technology changes  organizational change  employee health and safety concerns  and the globalization of companies 
the trend towards outsourcing white collar jobs could cause our major customers in our core markets to shift employment growth to countries where our market share is not as strong 
our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have sales offices and manufacturing facilities in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture  design  develop or sell products in particular countries  which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including differing employment practices and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  and natural disasters  security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  and global health issues 
in the united states and most countries in europe  our revenues and costs are typically in the same currency 
however there are some situations where we export and import products in different currencies 
we also may hold assets  such as equity investments  real estate investments and cash balances  or incur debt in currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business  and changes in currency controls with respect to such countries  could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tariff and import regulations and changes to us and international monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue 
varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could negatively impact our overall tax rate 
disruptions to the supply of raw materials  components and labor in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our supply chain management 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials and components from third party suppliers and our own manufacturing operations 
the flow of such materials and components may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of the raw materials  damage and loss or disruption of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes  and disruptions caused by labor activities 
we expect to continue to migrate to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model  which will increase our reliance on an international network of suppliers 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of products or deficiencies in our ability to develop and manage our international network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by increasing raw material costs 
we procure raw materials from a significant number of sources within the united states  canada  europe and asia 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the absolute level and volatility in steel and other commodity costs  such as energy  have significantly increased in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
these changes could also lead to supply interruptions 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs remain high or escalate further 
in the short run  rapid changes in supply costs can be very difficult to offset because of price hold agreements we have entered into with our customers 
it is difficult to find effective hedge markets to manage these risks 
in the longer run  we may not be successful in passing along a portion of the higher raw materials costs to our customers because of competitive pressures 
disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
in the united states and canada  we rely largely on a network of independent and company owned dealers to market our products to customers 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers 
we do not have written contracts with our domestic dealers  however  they are subject to a uniform set of guidelines prescribed by us 
from time to time  an individual dealer or steelcase may choose to terminate the relationship  or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
in addition  our competitors or other third parties could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert a number of our dealers to carry their products 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership  thereby increasing our financial exposure 
a portion of our international distribution network is owned because of the need for us to make financial investments in dealerships 
if we are not able to effectively manage these dealerships  they could have a negative effect on our operating results 
in certain cases we have adopted a direct model of distribution through which we establish a company owned sales and service capability 
this model involves increased customer credit risk  the risk of conflict with other distribution channels  and the risk that we will not be able to compete effectively to win business in those markets because of a more limited breadth of product offering than a dealer who carries multiple lines of products 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with our dealer network 
in specific situations  the company may choose to extend credit to or guarantee the obligations of a dealer which can increase our financial exposure 
a significant portion of our accounts receivable is due from our dealers 
individual dealers may not continue to be viable or profitable 
if dealers go out of business or restructure  we may suffer losses because such dealers may not be able to pay for products already delivered to them 
sometimes we loan funds to  or invest funds in  dealers for project financing or to finance ownership changes 
we carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers involved in financial and ownership transition transactions 
while most of the dealers that have transition financing from us are able to honor their financial obligations  some individual dealers could face financial challenges 
if these dealers experience declines in revenues  the likelihood of losses resulting from these financing transactions could increase and we may have to record additional charges or reserves  as necessary 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by increasing healthcare costs 
we provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our employees and certain of our retirees and their respective eligible dependents 
the cost of providing such benefits has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase 
although we have taken various actions intended to mitigate the impact of such cost increases  such as making changes in benefit plan design  changing plan administrators and increasing the portion of the cost of healthcare benefits borne by plan participants  if our actions are not effective in mitigating the cost increases  or if we are unable to continue to mitigate such increases because of contractual obligations or competitive pressures  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
we could incur material costs related to product defects 
we incur various expenses related to product defects  including product warranty costs  product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs 
the amount of our product defect expenses relative to product sales varies from time to time and could increase in the future 
we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions  but our actual warranty costs could exceed our reserve and we could need to increase our accruals for warranty charges 
any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
we have significant asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols in various jurisdictions 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction to fully utilize our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk which could reduce the amount that we will ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols 
our investments in company owned life insurance are subject to market risk which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
we have investments in company owned life insurance policies with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for post retirement medical benefits  deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plan obligations 
the cash value of these policies is based on the market value of bond and equity investments and can fluctuate as these markets fluctuate 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain investments and their results could be better or worse than the broader united states equity markets returns 
our acquisition  joint venture  or alliance activities may not be successful 
our growth strategy may involve acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances and additional channels of distribution 
some of the risks associated with these activities are we may not identify attractive opportunities or be able to enter into transactions on acceptable terms and at the right price  we may not successfully integrate acquired entities into our operations and be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies  our business philosophy may change which could affect the business rationale for our joint ventures or alliances  and we may not successfully implement new distribution channels  and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws  and our financial results could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws 
we are currently liable for various investigations and remediation of environmental contamination  and we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
any present or future investigations and remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could entail material costs or otherwise result in material liabilities 
the amount of future clean up costs and other environmental liabilities could be material 
see the discussion under environmental matters in item business for additional information regarding potential liabilities that we may incur in connection with environmental matters

net income improved over for similar reasons 
our revenue increased in compared to following an increase of from to revenue in increased for all of our reportable segments  but was primarily driven by growth in our north america segment 
as compared to  revenue benefited by from service businesses in the north america segment that were not reported in revenue in see note and from four small acquisitions completed during the year 
current year revenue was negatively impacted by from currency translation effects as compared to the prior year 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved percentage points in compared to the prior year 
improved pricing yield  higher sales volume  and prior restructuring efforts were all factors in this improvement 
operating income improved in  despite of higher restructuring charges  due to higher sales and improved cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
we recorded net pre tax operating charges for restructuring items totaling in  as compared to in  and in the net charges in primarily consisted of facility rationalizations in the north america and international reportable segments 
the north america charges were part of a two year restructuring effort announced on march   to continue to consolidate our north america operations by closing certain manufacturing and distribution facilities in grand rapids  michigan 
see further discussion and detail of all these items in the segment disclosure analysis below and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net  improved in due to higher interest income  unrealized gains on derivative instruments  and lower interest expense  partially offset by the change in the elimination of minority interest in consolidated dealers and the change in the gain loss on dealer transitions

interest expense decreased in primarily due to the retirement of of debt related to our corporate aircraft in q interest expense in increased from due to the consolidation of debt from variable interest entities 
interest on our term notes has been stable since because the interest rates are fixed 
interest income increased in and due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
the unrealized gains on derivative instruments in relate to interest rate lock derivative contracts 
in anticipation of refinancing our senior notes which mature in november  we entered into derivative contracts with a notional amount of to effectively lock in the five year treasury note interest rate which is expected to be the base component of the coupon rate for the debt 
a gain on these derivatives was recorded to adjust the contracts to fair value at february  on march   we designated the interest rate locks as hedges 
therefore  beginning on the designation date  all changes in the fair market value of the interest rate locks will be recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
although the designation date is later than the date that the contracts were entered into  we expect the hedges to be highly effective as required for hedge accounting 
our consolidated results include the results of several dealers where we either own a majority interest or we maintain participative control but our investments are structured such that we do not share in the profits or losses 
elimination of minority interest in consolidated dealers represents the elimination of earnings where either our class of equity does not share in the earnings or the earnings are allocated to the minority interest holder 
these amounts were previously included in miscellaneous expense  net 
prior year amounts have been reclassified 
the increase in the current year elimination is due to improved profitability of the dealers 
equity in income of unconsolidated ventures represents our portion of the income from our joint ventures 
during  the gain on disposal of property and equipment related to the sale of excess idle land in morocco for net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of the gain in primarily related to property sold in the united kingdom for net cash proceeds of and a pre tax non operating gain of this facility had been idle for about three years prior to the sale as a result of prior restructuring activities 
the loss on dealer transitions recorded in relates to an additional reserve against a lease that was retained as part of a previous dealer transition 
in  we recorded a gain on dealer transitions which represented an equity return related to a previous international dealer transition and a recovery on dealer transition financing that was previously reserved 
the majority of the loss recorded in related to an international dealer transition 
the foreign exchange gain in primarily represents the gain on derivative instruments related to our euro denominated intercompany loans 
we carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers in ownership transition 
we have established reserves for certain dealers facing difficult financial challenges 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect the credit risk associated with these dealers 
if these dealers experience additional financial challenges  the likelihood of losses would increase and we would record additional charges or reserves  as necessary 
although our tax rate can vary from year to year  we expect that our long term effective tax rate will be approximately 
in  we recorded an reduction in a specific tax reserve 
the tax reserve was originally recorded in response to a fiscal tax calculation that was later rejected by the irs 
at the time of the rejection  we recorded a reserve for the total amount of the deduction while we challenged the irs s decision 
the matter was settled during resulting in the reversal of the reserve 
we calculated our tax expense for using a rate and then adjusted it for the favorable reserve reduction

north america year ended income statement data north america february  february  february  revenue cost of sales restructuring costs gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating income loss the north america business generated of additional profits in compared to after an increase of during the improvement was driven by increased revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
revenues increased and accounted for of consolidated revenues for the year 
revenue growth in is attributed to stronger market demand  improved pricing yield  a significant increase in sales of the moderately priced turnstone brand  along with solid sales growth across most of our other product categories 
additionally  current year revenue included of service revenue and of revenue from an acquisition see note  which had the net effect of increasing revenue by compared to the prior year 
cost of sales improved percentage points over the prior year because of improved pricing yields  leverage from higher sales volume  and benefits from prior restructuring actions 
from an operational perspective  we also generated a number of productivity improvements from our restructuring actions and our focus on lean manufacturing principles 
we incurred ongoing costs of moving and reconfiguring production lines as we continue to reduce our manufacturing footprint and simplify our product offering 
after a significant increase in steel costs in  steel costs decreased during  but were still higher than in years prior to the decrease was largely offset by increases in many other commodities as well as increases in fuel and utility costs 
during q  we implemented a price increase and ended the steel surcharge at the same time 
the price increase did not have a significant impact on results 
cost of sales as a percent of revenue in our wood category is higher than our other product categories 
we are actively implementing initiatives to improve profitability including yield analysis  common platforms  and simplicity projects 
gross profit as a percent of revenue improved from in the prior year to in the current year  despite in higher restructuring costs 
this year s change in accounting for service revenue had the effect of reducing the north american gross margin percentage for the year by points compared to the prior year 
service revenue and related expense was previously recorded as a net adjustment within operating expenses 
restructuring costs of  reported separately from cost of sales  primarily included in charges for the consolidation of several of our north america manufacturing plants  which was announced on march  and for a lease impairment 
the charges included severance charges  asset impairment costs  gain on the sale of a manufacturing plant  and curtailment gains related to post retirement benefit plans 
the asset impairment charges included a charge of related to our grand rapids complex 
we are in the process of closing the plants in our grand rapids complex and we have been marketing the properties to real estate developers 
during q  we received proposals from multiple developers that were lower than the book value that was recorded and our previous estimates of fair value resulting in the impairment charge 
operating expenses improved from of revenue in to in this improvement reflects continued cost control as well as revenue growth 
on a dollar basis  spending increased due to several factors including in increased sales and marketing expenditures  of higher variable compensation  from the change in reporting for certain service businesses and related to our acquisition 
steelcase design partnership year ended income statement data steelcase design partnership february  february  february  revenue cost of sales restructuring costs gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating income sdp improved profitability in following a large increase in revenue for the sdp segment increased in and in each of the brands within sdp reported sales growth for the year  and growth was strong across most product categories 
most notably  growth within the furniture brands was 
sdp has the highest gross profit percentage among all of our segments 
gross profit as a percent of revenue was consistent with despite the rising cost of commodities and higher volume of lower margin furniture 
these negative impacts were offset by the spread of fixed costs over a higher volume of sales 
operating expenses in dollars and as a percent of revenue decreased during primarily due to higher volume and continued cost control 
international year ended february  february  february  income statement data international revenue cost of sales restructuring costs benefit gross profit operating expenses restructuring costs operating loss international reported a loss in but improved compared to despite an increase in restructuring charges of the improved results were primarily driven by higher revenue and productivity improvements 
revenue increased in primarily due to increased sales in france  eastern and central europe  latin america  and asia 
revenue also included from newly acquired dealers see note 
these improvements were partially offset by from unfavorable currency translation effects compared to the prior year 
cost of sales as a percent of revenue improved in and primarily due to increased volume and productivity improvements  partially offset by higher sales of our lower margin products and operational issues in the united kingdom uk 
gross profit as a percent of revenue was in compared to in gross profit was favorably impacted by improved cost of sales as a percent of revenue  however  that improvement was more than offset by higher restructuring costs 
the restructuring costs primarily relate to costs associated with consolidating our french manufacturing operations which was initiated in  impairment and severance charges to outsource our european wood manufacturing business  an impairment charge related to idle real estate on our strasbourg campus  and charges to restructure our operations in malaysia 
restructuring charges were minimal in in  restructuring costs primarily related to the closure or consolidation of manufacturing facilities  including workforce reductions 
operating expenses increased by in  primarily due to from dealers acquired during the year  from charges to write off accounts receivable previously owed to us by the dealers we acquired and for lease impairment charges and related reserves recorded in the uk these increases were partially offset by in currency translation effects 
restructuring costs related to operating expenses in are primarily the result of changes to business and information technology processes in europe and severance charges for the restructuring of our operations in italy 
restructuring costs related to operating expenses in and primarily consisted of charges related to workforce reductions and business exit costs 
economic conditions in certain countries continue to put profitability pressure on some of our dealers 
we continue to monitor the financial condition of dealers for changes in credit quality but we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if dealers experience a deeper reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary 
other year ended february  february  february  income statement data other revenue restructuring costs operating loss our other category includes our polyvision  ideo  and steelcase financial services subsidiaries  and unallocated corporate expenses 
revenue decreased by in due to slower demand in the educational markets  a key segment for polyvision  and the run off of the lease portfolio at steelcase financial services 
these decreases were partially offset by growth with key clients and expanded service offerings at ideo 
restructuring costs included in relate to the consolidation of two polyvision facilities 
restructuring costs in included a polyvision lease impairment and workforce reductions 
restructuring costs in primarily related to workforce reductions 
the increase in operating loss in is primarily due to lower revenue and higher new product development and market development costs at polyvision 
this was partially offset by improved operating income for ideo 
approximately of corporate expenses representing shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
the unallocated portion of these expenses is considered general corporate costs and is reported within the other category 
revenue and costs of exploring new business opportunities within new market niches or areas related to  but not part of  our core business activities are considered ventures  and are reported in the other category 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows year ended february  february  february  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period during  we increased cash and cash equivalents by to a balance of as of february   our highest level of cash as a public company 
however  of the increase represents the conversion of short term investments to cash and cash equivalents 
of our total cash and cash equivalents  was located in the united states and the remaining was located outside of the united states  primarily in canada and europe 
these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to a number of factors 
operating activities generated cash primarily from net income and from adjusting for depreciation and amortization which are non cash expenses 
depreciation and amortization continue to be much higher than current levels of capital expenditures 
the largest impact in investing activities was from converting short term investments to cash 
financing activities used cash to pay down debt and to pay dividends 
we look at various scenarios for cash planning purposes 
in one possible scenario a substantial and rapid increase in revenue in a short period of time we anticipate we would likely experience a corresponding rapid increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
this rapid increase in required working capital would represent a significant use of cash 
we retain sufficient cash balances to respond to working capital needs driven by a rapid increase in revenue 
we believe we currently need between and in cash to fund the day to day operating needs of our business 
our cash balances fluctuate from quarter to quarter because our business has some seasonality and certain cash flows related to variable compensation  retirement funding and insurance payments occur only annually 
at this time  we expect to maintain an additional cushion of to for funding investments in our business  including investments related to our growth initiatives and restructuring activities  and to protect the company in the event of a downturn while we are still restructuring our operations 
we will also use cash to return value to shareholders  primarily through dividends but also through selective use of share repurchases 
these are general guidelines and our cash balance may be higher or lower at any point in time 
we also may change this approach as conditions change or new opportunities emerge 
significant uses of cash in q include a payment of related to variable compensation contribution 
cash provided by operating activities year ended february  february  february  cash flow data operating activities net income loss depreciation and amortization gain on sale of net assets of discontinued operations deferred income taxes cumulative effect of accounting change changes in operating assets and liabilities other  net net cash provided by operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities was sufficient to fund our capital expenditure needs for and we expect this trend to continue 
the year to year change in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to improvements in year over year income from continuing operations 
additionally  changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased in the current year compared to the prior year due to an improvement in management of working capital  primarily through an improvement in accounts receivable days sales outstanding 
most of the change in cash generated from operating activities from to was due to the improvements in year over year income from continuing operations 
additionally  other  net decreased primarily due to current year restructuring payments  lower charges related to dealer transitions and fixed asset impairments and disposals 
cash provided by used in investing activities year ended february  february  february  cash flow data investing activities capital expenditures short term investments  net proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets net proceeds from repayments of lease fundings net decrease increase in notes receivable proceeds from the sales of leased assets acquisitions  net of cash acquired proceeds on sale of net assets of discontinued operations other  net net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in includes the sale and conversion of all of our short term investments in auction rate securities to investments in commercial paper  which are classified as cash equivalents 
in and  we used cash to purchase auction rate securities 
we continue to closely scrutinize capital spending to ensure we are making the right investments to sustain our business and to preserve our ability to introduce innovative  new products 
capital expenditures continue to be less than depreciation  which represented a source of cash 
capital expenditures increased in primarily due to in payments for the replacement of a corporate aircraft compared to progress payments of in we received in proceeds from the sale of the aircraft that we replaced 
proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets in also included from the sale of a manufacturing facility 
proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets in and primarily relate to the sale of domestic and international manufacturing facilities and related equipment 
in  we generated cash from the sale of leased and fixed assets and the sale of our attwood facility 
the sale of leased assets was primarily due to the new lease funding strategy implemented by steelcase financial services in in preparation for its new strategy  steelcase financial services sold a large portion of its lease portfolio in and continued to sell a portion of the remaining leased assets during and under its new strategy  steelcase financial services continues to originate leases for customers  but uses a third party to provide lease funding 
during each of the past three years  cash was generated from repayments on leases that were not sold 
we expect to continue to generate cash from the remaining owned leases in  but at a lower level 
acquisitions  net of cash acquired  represents the purchase of three small dealerships acquired by our international segment and a small technology services company that was acquired by a company owned dealer as part of our north america segment 
we have an outstanding commitment to purchase a corporate aircraft that is intended to replace an existing aircraft 
we currently have on deposit toward this purchase 
we expect to take delivery of the aircraft in with a total remaining commitment of cash used in financing activities year ended february  february  february  cash flow data financing activities dividends paid repayments of short term and long term debt  net common stock issuance  net of repurchases net cash used in financing activities we used cash in financing activities in primarily to pay down debt and to pay common stock dividends to our shareholders 
we paid common stock dividends of per share in and per share in and the dividend declared by the board of directors was per share for each of the last three quarters of and per share for q in and  the dividend declared by the board of directors was per share in each of the quarters 
during q  we announced an increase in the dividend rate to per share for q this increase is expected to use additional cash of approximately in q we issued common stock in for proceeds of related to the exercise of employee stock options 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the company s stock based incentive plans 
the board of directors has previously authorized share repurchases of up to million shares 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share including commissions 
the total cost of this repurchase was approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under our board s authorization and we have no outstanding share repurchase commitments 
since the inception of our repurchase program  million shares have been repurchased for we consider the use of both share repurchases and dividends as vehicles to return cash to shareholders 
capital resources off balance sheet arrangements we are contingently liable under loan and lease guarantees for certain steelcase dealers and joint ventures in the event of default or non performance of the financial repayment of the liability 
in certain cases  we also guarantee completion of contracts for our dealers 
due to the contingent nature of guarantees  the full value of the guarantees are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets  however  we have reserves recorded to cover potential losses

committed capital expenditures represent obligations we have related to property  plant and equipment purchases and include an outstanding commitment to purchase a corporate aircraft that is intended to replace an existing aircraft 
we define purchase obligations as non cancelable signed contracts to purchase goods or services beyond the needs of meeting current backlog or production 
other long term liabilities represent contribution and benefit payments expected to be made for our post retirement  pension  deferred compensation  and defined contribution benefit plans 
it should be noted that our obligations related to post retirement benefit plans are not contractual and the plans could be amended at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors 
we limited our disclosure of contributions and benefit payments to years as information beyond this time period was not available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these plans

borrowings under this facility are unsecured and unsubordinated 
there are currently no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
this committed facility and another financing agreement require us to satisfy financial covenants including a maximum debt ratio covenant and a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant

our long term debt rating is bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s and ba with a positive outlook from moody s investor service 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting policies that typically involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity are listed and explained below 
these policies were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluate goodwill using five reporting units north america  sdp  international  polyvision and ideo 
as of february   we had of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as follows recorded reporting unit goodwill north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision ideo total during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units consistent with the prior year 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a combination of two methods based upon a discounted cash flow valuation dcf and a market value approach mva 
the first method used a weighting factor based on dcf while the second valuation was based upon of dcf and of mva 
in either case  we concluded no impairment existed in any reporting unit 
the dcf analysis was based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value and used the following assumptions a business is worth today what it can generate in future cash to its owners  cash received today is worth more than an equal amount of cash received in the future  and future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
the mva used a set of four comparable companies to derive a range of market multiples for the last twelve months revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the mva was not calculated for polyvision or ideo as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows enterprise value in excess of reported goodwill using an discount rate discounted market cash flow value reporting unit valuation approach north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a the mva was not calculated for polyvision or ideo as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
for each reporting unit  this excess is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate from to  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the excess amounts above to the following amounts enterprise value in excess of reported goodwill using a discount rate discounted market cash flow value reporting unit valuation approach north america steelcase design partnership international polyvision n a ideo n a the mva was not calculated for polyvision or ideo as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
we also perform impairment analyses on our other intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
these intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks within the polyvision reporting unit 
as of the valuation date  the fair value exceeded the book value by approximately a decrease in projected revenue would result in a reduction of the excess fair value by a increase in the discount rate would result in a reduction of the excess fair value by for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  an impairment analysis is performed at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determined if the asset was recoverable 
we then compared the undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  long term expected fund returns  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plan obligations including a sensitivity analysis 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable  investments in leases and notes receivable is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date 
in estimating probable losses  we review accounts that are past due  non performing  or in bankruptcy 
we also review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the customer or dealer  such as financial statements  news reports  and published credit ratings 
we also use general information regarding industry trends  the general economic environment and information gathered through our network of field based employees 
using an estimate of current fair market value of the collateral and other credit enhancements  such as third party guarantees  we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the trade balance based on historical trends 
our projection of credit losses is based on estimates  and as a result we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such losses 
changes in economic conditions  the risk characteristics and composition of the portfolio  bankruptcy laws or regulatory policies and other factors could impact our actual and projected credit losses and the related allowance for possible credit losses 
if we had made different assumptions about probable credit losses  our financial position and results of operations could have differed 
uncollectible receivable balances are written off when we determine that the balance is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
see further discussion regarding concentrations of credit risk in note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company has operating loss carryforwards of and tax credit carryforwards of available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for these carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we estimate a tax benefit from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowance of  but we have recorded a valuation allowance of which reduces our estimated tax benefit to additionally  we have recorded a valuation allowance of against our tax credit carryforwards which reduces our estimated tax benefit to it is considered more likely than not that a benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately operating loss operating loss carryforwards carryforwards tax credit year ending february  gross tax effected carryforwards total carryforwards valuation allowance net benefit forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations

foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures 
we have entered into a series of forward contracts to hedge our net investment in canada to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in exchange rates 
as of february   the notional amount of these contracts was changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating income by approximately in and in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity until sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the net foreign currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  net transaction gains were interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our notes receivable  investments in company owned life insurance  short term borrowings and long term debt 
substantially all of our interest rates on our term borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized 
in anticipation of refinancing our senior notes which mature in november  we entered into derivative contracts with a notional amount of to effectively lock in the five year treasury note interest rate which is the base component of the coupon rate for the debt 
we are still exposed to changes in the credit spreads in the corporate bond market until the new bonds are issued 
the interest rate locks expire at the same time that the existing debt matures 
a portion of our company owned life insurance cash surrender value is invested in fixed income securities 
the valuation of these securities is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for or see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps and derivative instruments 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance 
bond and equity price risk we are exposed to bond and equity price risk primarily on our investments in company owned life insurance 
we estimate that a adverse change in the value of the underlying funds  which could be caused by changes in interest rates  portfolio duration or equity prices  would have reduced our operating income by approximately and in and  respectively 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the market returns
