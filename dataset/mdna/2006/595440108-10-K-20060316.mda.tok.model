item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations external factors impacting the bank competitive factors 
other entities  both governmental and private industry  seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities  also provide competition for the bank in the acquisition of deposits 
banks also compete with money market funds and other providers of money market instruments 
commercial banks compete with savings and loan associations  credit unions  other financial institutions  securities brokerage firms and other entities for funds 
for instance  yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits 
commercial banks also compete for loans with savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies and other lending institutions 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes involving frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services that have further increased competition 
there can also be no assurance that these technological improvements  if made  will increase the bank s operational efficiency or that the bank will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
the trend toward consolidation of banking assets exhibited over the past few years in california continued in but other new institutions are coming on line to replace them 
statewide in  there were banks which either completed or announced merger into another institution 
according to the california state department of financial institutions however  applications for new banks were filed in in california  with of those having received approval 
employees at december   the bank had a total of employees  a number of which are part time 
on a full time equivalent basis  employees represent positions 
the bank believes that its employee relations are positive 
effect of governmental policies and legislation banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate received by the bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the bank s portfolio comprise the major portion of the bank s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the bank 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the bank are subject to the influence of local  domestic and foreign economic conditions  including recession  unemployment and inflation 
the commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession by its open market operations in united states government securities which effect short term rates such as the fed funds rate  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact on the bank of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial intermediaries 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial intermediaries are frequently made in congress  the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies 
see financial services modernization legislation  and sarbanes oxley act of supervision and regulation the bank is extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
set forth below  is a summary description of certain laws which relate to the regulation of the company and the bank 
the description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
mid state bancshares the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act  and is registered as such with  and subject to the supervision of  the federal reserve board 
it is required to file with the federal reserve board quarterly and annual reports and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve board may conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if  after giving effect to such acquisition of shares  the company would own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank 
prior approval of the federal reserve board is also required for the merger or consolidation of the company and another bank holding company 
the company is prohibited by the bank holding company act  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging  directly or indirectly  in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  the company may  subject to the prior approval of the federal reserve board  engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
the federal reserve board may require that the company terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest subsidiaries or affiliates when the federal reserve board determines that the activity or the control or the subsidiary or affiliates constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries 
the federal reserve board also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  the company must file written notice and obtain approval from the federal reserve board prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities 
under the federal reserve board s regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe and unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve board s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations or both 
the company and the bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  neither the company nor the bank may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by the company and the bank or an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor 
the company s common stock is registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
as such  we are subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  corporate governance  and other requirements and restrictions of such act 
the bank the bank is chartered under the laws of the state of california and its deposits are insured by the fdic to the extent provided by law 
the bank is subject to the supervision of  and is regularly examined by  the california department of financial institutions dfi and the fdic 
such supervision and regulation include comprehensive reviews of all major aspects of the bank s business and condition 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including reserves against deposits  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends and locations of branch offices 
further  the bank is required to maintain certain levels of capital 
if  as a result of an examination of a bank  the fdic or the dfi should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to these regulatory agencies 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a california chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
capital standards the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as certain business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets  which includes off balance sheet items  against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital consists primarily of common stock  retained earnings  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most intangible assets 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  cumulative preferred stock  long term preferred stock  eligible term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of 
mid state bank trust s ratios are and  respectively  as of december  on a consolidated basis  mid state bancshares ratios are and  respectively  at the same date 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least to basis points above the minimum  or to 
mid state bank trust s ratio is as of december  on a consolidated basis  mid state bancshares ratio is at the same date 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy 
such a change could affect the ability of the bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends to the company 
on january  legislation became effective which  among other things  gave the dfi power to take possession of the business and properties of a bank in the event that the tangible shareholders equity of the bank is less than the greater of i of the bank s total assets or ii million 
for additional information concerning the capital ratios of the company and the bank  see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the bank was considered well capitalized as of december  prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
banks are also subject to certain federal reserve board restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons ie  insiders 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms and pursuant to the same credit underwriting procedures as those for comparable transactions with persons who are neither insiders nor employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders 
a violation of these restrictions may result in regulatory sanctions on the bank or its insiders 
premiums for deposit insurance the bank s deposits are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor through the bank insurance fund administered by the fdic 
the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums  which are assessed semiannually and paid quarterly 
the premium amount is based upon a risk classification system established by the fdic 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
the fdic is also empowered to make special assessments on insured depository institutions in amounts determined by the fdic to be necessary to give it adequate assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the us treasury and other sources or for any other purpose the fdic deems necessary 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the president signed the budget reconciliation package s 
that contains the comprehensive federal deposit insurance reform act of this legislation  among other things  i merges the bank insurance fund bif and the savings associations insurance fund saif into the deposit insurance fund dif  ii establishes a process for indexing coverage levels to account for inflation  iii sets a cap on the dif  iv sets up a system of dividends  v gives certain banks credit for past over payments to the fund  vi gives the fdic added flexibility should the fund ever face financial difficulty  and vii increases deposit insurance coverage to  for certain retirement accounts 
the legislation will become effective six months after the fdic completes their regulations covering the above items 
sarbanes oxley act of on july   the sarbanes oxley act of sox  was signed into law to address corporate and accounting fraud 
sox establishes a new accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing standards and restricts the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients 
among other things  sox also i requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the sec  ii imposes new disclosure requirements regarding internal controls  off balance sheet transactions  and pro forma non gaap disclosures  iii accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies  and iv requires companies to disclose whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one audit committee financial expert 
under sox  the sec is required to regularly and systematically review corporate filings  based on certain enumerated factors 
to deter wrongdoing  sox i subjects bonuses issued to top executives to disgorgement if a restatement of a company s financial statements was due to corporate misconduct  ii prohibits an officer or director from misleading or coercing an auditor  iii prohibits insider trades during pension fund blackout periods  iv imposes new criminal penalties for fraud and other wrongful acts  and v extends the period during which certain securities fraud lawsuits can be brought against a company or its officers 
as a public reporting company  the company is subject to the requirements of sox and related rules and regulations issued by the sec and nasdaq 
the company has incurred additional expense as a result of the requirements of the act  but does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on its business overall 
financial services modernization legislation on november   the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act is intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks  insurance companies  the securities industry and other financial service providers 
it provides financial organizations with the flexibility of structuring such affiliations through a holding company structure or through a financial subsidiary of a bank  subject to certain limitations 
the financial services modernization act establishes a new type of bank holding company  known as a financial holding company  which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are financial in nature  which include securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the company has not chosen to seek financial holding company status 
the financial services modernization act also sets forth a system of functional regulation that makes the federal reserve board the umbrella supervisor for holding companies  while providing for the supervision of the holding company s subsidiaries by other federal and state agencies 
in addition  the bank is subject to other provisions of the financial services modernization act  including those relating to cra  privacy and safe guarding confidential customer information  regardless of whether the company elects to become a financial holding company or to conduct activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company does not  however  currently intend to file notice with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company and the bank do not believe that the financial services modernization act will have a material adverse effect on their operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company and the bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company and the bank 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or the patriot act  of among other things  the patriot act i prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  ii imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals iii requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering compliance program  and iv eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records 
the department of the treasury is empowered to administer and make rules to implement the patriot act 
there are various measures pending in the us congress which would extend the provisions of the act 
while the company and the bank believes the patriot act affects their recordkeeping and reporting expenses  they do not believe that it has a material adverse effect on their business and operations 
bank secrecy act in  congress passed the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  otherwise known as the bank secrecy act the bsa  which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions 
the bsa was designed to help identify the source  volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the united states in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking  terrorism and other criminal activities 
the primary tool used to implement bsa requirements is the filing of suspicious activity reports 
today  the bsa requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions 
these programs must  at a minimum  provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance  provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance  designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training 
transactions between affiliates transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve board issued regulation w on october   which comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
sections a and b and regulation w restrict loans by a depository institution to its affiliates  asset purchases by a depository institution from its affiliates  and other transactions between a depository institution and its affiliates 
regulation w unifies in one public document the federal reserve board s interpretations of section a and b 
regulation w had an effective date of april  community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance  resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulatory agency of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
at its last examination by the fdic  the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
the federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution s noncompliance with one or more standards 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public information to non affiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
a new capital plan of the fhlb of san francisco was approved by the federal housing finance board and was implemented on april  the new capital plan incorporates a single class of stock with a par value of per share  and may be issued  exchanged  redeemed  and repurchased only at par value 
each member must own stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the new capital stock is redeemable with five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
the effect of this plan was that the bank had to purchase million of additional fhlb stock bringing the total of its holdings to million 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following scenarios trigger coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
accounting changes from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb issues pronouncements which govern the accounting treatment for the company s financial statements 
for a description of the recent pronouncements applicable to the company see the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report

additionally  the company has undisbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which compares to million outstanding one year earlier 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by the company which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and undisbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans totaled million at the end of  compared to the million outstanding one year earlier

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks associated with our business 
we are highly dependent on real estate and a downturn in the real estate market could hurt our business 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
at december   real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately of our loan portfolio 
a decline in current economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans and the value of real estate owned by us  as well as our financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of our common stock 
acts of nature  including earthquakes  floods and fires  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans  may also negatively impact our financial condition 
we also have a concentration in commercial real estate loans 
we also have a high concentration in commercial real estate or cre loans 
cre loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending due  among other things  to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our income and financial condition 
in addition  unlike residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt 
cash flow may be significantly affected by general economic conditions 
banking regulators have recently issued proposed guidance regarding institutions that have particularly high concentrations of cre within their lending portfolios 
this guidance suggests that institutions that exceed certain levels of cre lending may be required  in the future  to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in cre lending 
if and when this proposed guidance becomes final  we may be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and subject to higher capital requirements 
our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
insufficient loan demand could have an adverse impact on our business 
we are significantly affected by the level of loan demand available in our markets 
strong local pressure from competitors to make loans to existing and potential customers also affects our ability to make sufficient loans 
the inability to make sufficient loans directly affects the interest income we earn 
lower loan demand will generally result in lower interest income since funds will be placed in lower yielding investments 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance and financial condition 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the demand for new loans  the credit profile of our borrowers  the rates received on loans and securities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the difference between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as interest rate spread 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may decrease our net interest spread by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates 
a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to refinance higher rate  fixed rate loans at lower rates  prepaying their existing loans 
under those circumstances  we would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans 
in addition  our commercial real estate and commercial loans  which carry interest rates that  in general  adjust in accordance with changes in the prime rate  will adjust to lower rates 
we are also significantly affected by the level of loan demand available in our market 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread can be expected to increase when market interest rates are rising  and to decline when market interest rates are declining 
the federal reserve board s decrease in rates during  and substantially impacted our interest rate spread  as the spread for declined to taxable equivalent from taxable equivalent in and from taxable equivalent in increases in short term rates by the federal reserve board in the latter half of through and into are having the effect of beginning to reverse this trend with our interest spread rising to taxable equivalent in although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to successfully execute our strategy could adversely affect our performance 
our financial performance and profitability depends on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations challenges and opportunities in continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long term financial performance goals include those stated elsewhere in this section  as well as inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee and healthcare costs  inability to increase non interest income  and continuing ability to expand  through de novo branching or finding acquisition targets at valuation levels we find attractive 
our primary market area is an increasingly competitive and overcrowded banking market 
our ability to achieve the growth outlined in our corporate strategic goals may be dependent in part on an ability to grow through the successful addition of new branches or the identification and acquisition of potential targets at acceptable pricing levels either inside or outside of our primary market 
if we are unable to attract significant new business through strategic branching  or acquiring new business through our acquisition of other banks  our growth in loans and deposits and  therefore  our earnings  may be adversely affected 
economic conditions on the california central coast could adversely affect our operations and or cause us to sustain losses 
our retail and commercial banking operations are concentrated primarily in san luis obispo and santa barbara counties 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in this area 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
this risk increases when the economy is weak 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in general and the market value of our stock 
potential acquisitions may affect our business and shareholder value 
we are currently seeking merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
we do not currently have any specific plans  arrangements or understandings regarding such expansion 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate such acquisitions 
in attempting to make such acquisitions  we anticipate competing with other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company 
exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company 
difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company 
potential disruption to our business 
potential diversion of management s time and attention 
the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company 
difficulty in estimating the value of the target company 
potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our stock s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  we may expand our branch network through de novo branches in existing or new markets 
these de novo branches will have expenses in excess of revenues for varying periods after opening that could decrease our reported earnings 
we face strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services that could hurt our business 
the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting quality assets and deposits and in making loans 
we compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share  decrease loan demand  cause the prices we charge for our services to fall  or decrease our net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates 
therefore  our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks 
we are subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
we maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
information systems 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  the central coast of california is subject to earthquakes and fires 
operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities 
while we have not experienced such an occurrence to date  other severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations 
as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service our obligations  including cash dividends 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
impairment of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet could lead to a charge against future period s earnings 
pursuant to generally accepted accounting practices gaap  we are required to periodically assess our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets to determine if they are impaired 
disruptions to our business  end market conditions and protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units  divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairments 
future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge 
in addition  such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders equity 
risks associated with our industry 
we are subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities  which in turn could adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or repeal of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our business 
we have to comply with all governmental regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act of  the bank secrecy act  the patriot act  the community reinvestment act  and many others 
the cumulative cost of compliance with these regulations could be significant and affect the ability of the company to earn an adequate return for its shareholders 
for example  operating expenses were impacted by the significant cost of compliance with the new sarbanes oxley section provisions in the years ended december  and further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects economic conditions for us 
new legislative and regulatory proposals may affect our operations and growth 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of  and federal insurance premiums paid by  banks and other financial institutions and companies that control such institutions are frequently raised in the us congress  state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities 
the likelihood of any major changes in the future and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine 
similarly  proposals to change the accounting treatment applicable to banks and other depository institutions are frequently raised by the sec  the federal banking agencies  the irs and other appropriate authorities 
the likelihood and impact of any additional future changes in law or regulation and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine at this time 
risks associated with our stock 
our stock trades less frequently than others 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
our stock price is affected by a variety of factors 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors discussed in this section  including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations 
recommendations by securities analysts 
operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company 
news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry 
perceptions in the marketplace regarding our company and or its competitors 
our common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may hinder a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

the company s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when declared by its board of directors  out of funds legally available therefore  subject to the restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law the corporation law 
the corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if the corporation s retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution 
the corporation law also provides that  in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may  nevertheless  make a distribution to its shareholders if it meets two conditions  which generally stated are as follows i the corporation s assets equal at least times its liabilities  and ii the corporation s current assets equal at least its current liabilities or  if the average of the corporation s earnings before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the corporation s interest expenses for such fiscal years  then the corporation s current assets must equal at least times its current liabilities 
the ability of the company to pay a cash dividend depends largely on the bank s ability to pay a cash dividend to the company 
the payment of cash dividends by the bank is subject to restrictions set forth in the california financial code the financial code 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a the bank s retained earnings  or b the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greater of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
the fdic may also restrict the payment of dividends if such payment would be deemed unsafe or unsound or if after the payment of such dividends  the bank would be included in one of the undercapitalized categories for capital adequacy purposes pursuant to federal law 
see  item prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
additionally  while the federal reserve board has no general restriction with respect to the payment of cash dividends by an adequately capitalized bank to its parent holding company  the federal reserve board might  under certain circumstances  place restrictions on the ability of a particular bank to pay dividends based upon peer group averages and the performance and maturity of the particular bank  or object to management fees to be paid by a subsidiary bank to its holding company on the basis that such fees cannot be supported by the value of the services rendered or are not the result of an arm s length transaction 
whether or not dividends will be paid in the future will be determined by the board of directors after consideration of various factors 
the company s profitability and regulatory capital ratios in addition to other financial conditions will be key factors considered by the board of directors in making such determinations regarding the payment of dividends by the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and business of the company the company has as its single  wholly owned subsidiary  mid state bank trust the bank 
the bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries msb properties  inc and mid coast land company discussed above in part i of this report and later in this management s discussion and analysis 
the bank was founded in and operates a full service commercial banking business serving its customers on the central coast of california 
headquartered in arroyo grande  it operates offices in communities throughout san luis obispo  santa barbara and ventura counties and serves nearly thousand households and businesses 
the following discussion and analysis will provide insight and supplementary information into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company 
it also provides management s assessment of the operating trends over the past few years and certain of their expectations for unless otherwise noted below  the discussion and analysis section deals almost exclusively with the community banking segment of the company 
the other two segments  mid coast land company and trust services  contribute a small percentage less than to the overall earnings of the company 
results and accomplishments financial summary the company  on a consolidated basis  reported net income of million in  million in and million in the diluted earnings per share eps was for compared to in and in consolidated total assets at december  were billion compared to billion at december   up 
total deposits also increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  shareholders common equity stood at million at year end down from its million level one year earlier 
there were a number of factors working to both increase and decrease this account which showed a net decline 
those factors working to increase shareholders common equity included  million of net income generated for the year and million received for the exercise of stock options 
these were offset however by  million in dividends paid out during  million paid for the repurchase of common stock outstanding  and a million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the table below illustrates net income by subsidiary unit 
income loss by subsidiary s bank only  pre tax msb properties  pre tax mid coast land co  pre tax parent only  pre tax tax expense net income mid state bancshares executive summary management considers the following to be the most significant items affecting net income during compared to during  with the federal reserve orchestrating a number of increases in short term interest rates  the prime rate to which many of the company s loans are tied increased times over the course of the year from at the start of the year to by the end of the year 
because of its general asset sensitivity  the company saw an improvement in its net interest margin from in to in  taxable equivalent 
coupled with a million increase in earning assets  this allowed the company to show a million increase in net interest income 
the company took a benefit to provision for loan losses of million in compared to no provision during the benefit taken to the provision for loan losses in reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
the company did not need to take any benefit to the provision for loan losses in because of the continued quality of the portfolio  it also did not have to take a charge to the provision for loan losses in the company realized non recurring gains in of million on the sale of oreo and thousand in securities gains 
the company had only minor securities gains of thousand in and no oreo gains 
the net decrease in total non interest expense amounted to million in compared to factors contributing to this decrease included decreases in merchant credit card processing fees of million on compared to  increases in salaries and employee benefits of million related primarily to the company s incentive bonus program and all other operating expenses increasing by thousand from one year to another 
the decrease in merchant credit card processing charges was a result of outsourcing this function to a third party 
there was a similar drop in non interest income 
management considers the following to be the most significant items affecting net income during compared to the company took a benefit to provision for loan losses of million in compared to a benefit of thousand in resulting in a positive pre tax improvement in earnings of million 
the benefit taken to the provision for loan losses in reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies and charge offs  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and an improved outlook for economic activity in general 
average earning assets increased by million in compared to more than offsetting the decline in the net interest margin from in to in taxable equivalent thereby allowing the company to show a million increase in net interest income 
the company realized non recurring gains in of million on the sale of oreo and thousand in securities gains 
the company had only minor securities gains of thousand in increases in the non interest expense amounted to million in compared to factors contributing to this increase included increases in outside professional services of thousand related to section sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  increases in advertising and promotional expenditures of approximately million in compared to  increases in costs reflecting the merger with ojai valley bank effective october  which resulted in two months of costs in the figures compared to a full months in  estimated to be an increase of million  increase in employee benefits primarily related to workers compensation and group insurance increases of thousand excluding the impact of the ojai employees and all other operating expenses increasing by million  net of declines the primary impact being salary increases of million excluding the impact of ojai employees 
there was a decline in the net gains realized on mortgage loans sold of million in compared to as a result of the dramatic slowdown in refinance activity during the year 
challenges and opportunities in management considers the following to be major challenges and opportunities for the company in they should be read in conjunction with the information contained in item a 
risk factors 
the number of additional increases in short term interest rates that the board of governors of the federal reserve system will cause to occur in the company s asset and liability  maturity and rate structure are such that its net interest margin should improve in a rising rate environment 
however  many pundits expect the number of additional increases in to be limited 
since the company received benefit to its spread and its net interest margin from the rate increases in  the extent to which it may receive additional benefit in could be limited 
the ability of the economy to continue its recovery and enhance the company s ability to grow its loan portfolio either through loan originations or purchases consistent with the company s credit standards 
loan growth in recent years has been adequate  however  competition is intense and no assurance can be given that in future periods the company will be able to obtain a sufficient share of the business available 
the ability of the company to generate new revenue sources either through new customers in existing or new markets  increased fees on existing products or the introduction of new products 
because the company is well capitalized and its stock price is trading at favorable multiples of book value and earnings  it is well positioned to make strategic acquisitions in selected markets but only at valuation levels we find attractive 
the ability of the company to contain salary and benefits costs which have risen in recent years  especially in view of the expensing of stock options initial estimates for put the impact at approximately million pre tax  or per share see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which follows in item of this report and the start up costs of new banking facilities a branch office and commercial banking office in the westlake village market 
the ability of the company to fully integrate its relatively new ventura county offices and presence into the company and take advantage of the expanded market opportunities it sees there 
the company believes its expanded presence in ventura county will allow it to take advantage of the large and growing economic base in that part of its market area 
expansion into the westlake village market in the spring of should enhance this effort 
the ability of the company to make its internal support functions more efficient by exploring  and then implementing  a plan to consolidate their operations in one location in a cost effective manner 
the ability of the company to continue to be competitive on deposit and loan pricing in the face of intense competition from its competitors 
these competitive pressures could affect both interest income in a downward manner and deposit costs in an upward manner leading to a compression of the net interest margin 
the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel 
since the company has the capacity  it may increase its other borrowings during in an effort to diversify its funding sources and purchase earning assets which create a positive spread for the income statement  allowing it to more profitably leverage its strong capital base 
other events and items of note in the company s stock repurchase program continued in with  shares repurchased  which compares to  and  shares repurchased in and  respectively 
the average price paid for the stock over this three year period was   and  respectively 
as of december   the company had  shares remaining to repurchase under its june authorization approved by the board of directors to re purchase up to  additional shares 
the authorization does not have an expiration date 
external factors impacting the bank economic conditions in last year s annual report we noted that  management is encouraged that should again be a solid year for the economy in the company s trade area our local trade area again appears to be in a solid position at the start of to continue the recovery underway and maintain low unemployment rates 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system have started raising short term interest rates and management expects this trend to continue with the target fed funds rate reaching the mid range by year end 
management also expects that longer term rates will rise much more modestly  if at all  in keeping with a continued trend towards a flatter yield curve 
we note that this forecast proved reasonably accurate 
the federal reserve increased short term rates throughout with the bellwether federal funds rate reaching at december  while the national unemployment rate dropped from at the start of to by the end of the year  locally  unemployment rates also fell with san luis obispo county falling to at the end of compared to at the start of the year and santa barbara county falling to from one year earlier 
the yield curve also  as expected  flattened dramatically with the spread between the three month and ten year treasury declining from basis points at the start of to just basis points at the end of the year 
the ten year treasury is actually little changed from its level at the start of the year having closed at at the end of management is of the opinion that the flattening of the yield curve portrays a general belief that future inflation will be in line with recent historical experience eg the consumer price index was up and in and  respectively and we have no reason to change that expectation 
notwithstanding spikes in energy prices  inflation does appear to be in check 
the most comprehensive review of local economic conditions in our market known to management comes from the university of california at santa barbara ucsb economic forecast project 
according to ucsb  gross county product in the tri county area was estimated at billion in  up from the level in the prior year 
adjusted for real dollars  it was up following a growth rate in and in these rates of growth were down from the double digit increases witnessed in the late s 
for california as a whole  real gross state product was in  in and in  slightly ahead of the tri county experience 
expectations by ucsb for are for further improvements with the real state product growing and the real tri county gross product growing somewhat slower at a pace 
a survey of business owners across the tri county area conducted by ucsb in the third quarter of found general optimism with respect to expected business activity over the coming year 
survey participants were queried  will you be expanding or downsizing your firm in the next twelve months while of the respondents said they did not expect to expand or contract  fully expected to expand to and expected to expand or more 
in contrast  only of respondents expected to contract 
reflecting similar optimism  when asked  in six months  do you expect your firm to be better or worse off  over expected to be better off or much better off compared to just expecting to be worse off 
all of this evidence indicates to management that growth should continue in in the local economy at similar levels to with nominal growth in the to range and real growth in the to range 
median home prices are at historical highs throughout the bank s service area 
the median price of a home in is estimated to have reached thousand in san luis obispo county  up from a year earlier 
in santa barbara county  that figure is estimated to have reached thousand  up from one year earlier 
and in ventura county  the median home price is estimated to have grown at a somewhat slower pace from one year before 
in spite of numerous residential building projects in the bank s trade area and housing affordability indices falling below in most locales  the local real estate market still appears relatively healthy with a combination of historically low interest rate levels and demand ahead of supply 
the strong trends in both residential and non residential real estate exhibited in recent years are believed to be slowing somewhat though as we enter lenders continue to be very prudent in their lending practices having learned the lessons of the early s and hence building is far less speculative 
collectively  all factors considered  management does not see significant risk of a dramatic slowdown in real estate in however  management would not be surprised to see flat housing prices in or even some modest downward pressure on prices  as a correction to the dramatic increases seen over the past several years 
it is also significant that high real estate prices have created a demographic trend of aging home owners replacing working class residents who find first time home ownership difficult 
this is contributing to an out migration by young families with working aged heads of households 
the impact of this demographic trend has implications on the local economy and the types of businesses that operate here with service and retail oriented businesses likely to be more predominant compared to manufacturing and industrial type businesses 
with positive indicators continuing in the national economic statistics and a solid economic base locally  management is encouraged that should again be a positive year overall for the economy in the company s trade area 
as mentioned last year  this optimism must be tempered by the potential for disruption resulting from geopolitical issues surrounding homeland security and terrorism 
the effects of episodes such as the terrorist attacks  the wars in afghanistan and iraq  and the international tensions surrounding these events  can have a significant impact on economic activity 
in spite of this caveat  our local trade area again appears to be in a solid position at the start of to continue solid economic growth and maintain low unemployment rates 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system are widely believed to be reaching the end of their drive to raise short term interest rates and management expects only modest additional increases with the target fed funds rate reaching the range by year end 
management again expects that longer term rates will rise modestly  with a continuing flat yield curve in place through competitive factors competitive pressures from other financial institutions continue to be intense both in the company s trade area and throughout the nation 
many banks are suffering from insufficient loan volumes and have become very aggressive on the pricing of those good credits available 
in the company s tri counties service area  financial institutions banks and savings institutions operate offices serving billion in deposits based on data as of june  these figures are up from institutions operating offices with billion in deposits one year earlier 
additionally  while management does not have specific metrics on competition from broker dealers  there is significant competition from brokerage houses providing competing deposit and investment products 
also  conduit financing from wall street is competing with the bank for larger loan transactions 
it should be noted that the trend toward consolidation of banking assets exhibited over the past few years in california continued in statewide  banks are merging out of existence based on announced merger transactions 
according to the state department of financial institutions however  new banks have filed in to start a new bank in california  with of those having been already approved

the bank expects to continue to emphasize all types of lending activity in order to diversify the risk in its portfolio 
economic activity in the central coast will determine the types of credit the bank will be able to extend and hence its ability to achieve this objective 
for a discussion of the company s concentrations in total real estate loans and in commercial real estate loans  see item a 
risk factors 
the bank s allowances for losses collectively stand at million  or of gross loans  and represents losses not yet realized  but inherent in the loan portfolio and on unfunded commitments 
the allowances for losses was million at december  the year end balance now represents of non performing loans which is up from the level at the end of owing to a drop in non performing loans 
a five year review of activity in the allowance for losses and an allocation by loan type of the allowance is shown in the tables below 
allowances for losses in s allowance for loan losses beginning of year allowance for losses unfunded commitments total allowances for losses provision for loan losses charged to operating expense provision for losses unfunded commitments credited charged to operating expense adjustments acquisition through merger loans charged off real estate loans installment loans commercial loans credit cards and related loans recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate loans installment loans commercial loans credit cards and related loans total allowances for losses allocation of allowance for losses in s allowance for loan losses allowance for losses unfunded commitments total allowance for losses ratio of net loan losses to average loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for losses compared to loan type as a percent of total at december dollars in s balance applicable to type as a of loans type as a of loans type as a of loans type as a of loans type as a of loans construction and land real estate hecl installment credit card and related commercial  other unfunded commitments n a n a n a n a n a unallocated n a n a n a n a n a balance at end of year during  we enhanced our methodology for determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses 
while our methodology had always consisted of two key components  an individual loan impairment component and a pool loan analysis component  the enhancement made in introduced improved methodology incorporating increased analysis of loss exposure associated with both historical loss rates and known qualitative factors present in various major segments of the loan portfolio 
the prior methodology relied on loss factors that provided results not significantly different from the results of our enhanced methodology 
however  with this enhancement  there was a reallocation in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses which was attributable  at least in part  to the enhanced calculation of loss exposure compared to prior years 
non accrual loans within the bank s portfolio decreased from million as of december   to million  at the end of loans days or more past due  and still accruing  remained at zero for the periods ending december  and december  additional information on non accrual loans  past due loans and troubled debt restructurings can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
over half of the level of non accrual loans at the end of is centered in one relationship total million 
management has established specific reserves that would offset potential losses  if any  arising from less than full recovery of the loan from the supporting collateral 
recoveries in of loans previously charged off totaled million compared to charge offs of million taken during the year resulting in net charge offs of million 
this figure compares to net recoveries of million and net charge offs of million in and  respectively 
with the combination of the collateral securing the problem loans and the size of the allowance for losses  management feels that the allowance is sufficient to cover inherent losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group quarterly to  among other things  review the reasonableness of individual asset classifications 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance on a regular basis 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
during  management took a benefit to the provision for loan losses of million 
no provision for loan losses was taken during these actions reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies  modest levels of net charge offs in recent years  a positive outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  and a positive outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
the allowance for losses consists of an allocated portion based on historical average loss experience adjusted for known expected loss factors and a specifically allocated portion 
the total of these components is considered adequate to provide for losses  which can be reasonably anticipated 
however  since these amounts are based on estimates  ultimate losses relating to these loans may vary and management believes that qualitative factors make it prudent to carry a reasonable level of an additional portion to absorb losses in excess of the allocated portion 
qualitative factors considered include  but are not limited to  portfolio composition  concentrations  off balance sheet risks  delinquencies and non accruals  criticized and classified loans  non performing loans  gross and net loan losses  changes in lending function  changes in management  the bank s organizational structure  the special assets group  lending and credit approval authorities  loan officer training  the credit review function  and real estate appraisal policies 
management continuously monitors residential real estate reports and markets  and is aware of a great deal of discussion surrounding a possible slow down and or drop in value of residential real estate in the bank s service area 
while long term interest rates remain relatively low and the bank s service area is marked by limited supply and healthy demand  residential projects financed by the bank are underwritten with a requirement of a percentage of cash equity to the total cost of the project in addition to prudent exposures to current appraised values 
to further mitigate this risk  individual projects financed are analyzed using direct  current and historical project trends with limitations to production unit starts ahead of sales using the projected absorption analysis contained in the appraisal of each project 
the bank believes  based upon past experience  that this process helps mitigate against the production of a supply of units that would exceed the current market demand 
additionally  due to the popularity of our market area to urban retirees and others wanting to enjoy the environment and lifestyle it provides  we have seen and continue to see a migration of wealthier individuals and families absorb the residential housing production with greater cash equities than is typical of other areas throughout the country 
this assumption is supported by the fact that the bank s portfolio of residential mortgages have an average loan to value ratio of less than along with average credit scores substantially exceeding industry standards with low delinquency ratios 
management does not see significant risk of a dramatic slowdown in real estate in however  management would not be surprised to see flat housing prices in or even some modest downward pressure on prices  as a correction to the dramatic increases seen over the past several years 
a summary of maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates at december  is shown in the table below

to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed composition of the investment portfolio 
overall  the portfolio showed a net reduction in outstanding balances over the course of as the bank redirected these earning assets into the loan portfolio and to a lesser extent the market value relative to amortized cost of the investment portfolio declined 
the treasury and agency portion of the portfolio decreased by million from one year ago 
holdings in the municipal bond portfolio were reduced from million at the end of to million at the end of in total  the bank decreased its investment portfolio from million at the end of to million at the end of  a million decrease 
the bank may segregate its portfolio into three categories a trading portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in the income statement  a held to maturity portfolio which is carried at amortized cost  with changes in market value having no impact on the financial statements and an available for sale portfolio which is carried at market value  with changes in market value reflected in comprehensive income 
the bank holds no securities that should be classified as trading or held to maturity securities 
the bank has determined that since its securities may be sold prior to maturity because of interest rate changes  to meet liquidity needs  or to better match the re pricing characteristics of funding sources  that the entire portfolio should be classified as available for sale 
adjustments to the available for sale portfolio for changes in market values resulted in an unrealized gain of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  compared to an unrealized gain of million at december   net of related taxes 
maturities and sales over the full year exceeded purchases and the total investment portfolio decreased by million from the end of to the end of shown below is a summary maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  by type and weighted taxable equivalent yield as of december  expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

goodwill and core deposit intangibles goodwill totaled million at december  and of this total  million was the result of the acquisition of ojai valley bank that was completed on october   million was the result of the acquisition of american commercial bank that was completed on september  and million relates to a may  acquisition of citizens bank of paso robles by bsm bancorp which the company acquired in on an annual basis  the company tests its goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill is entirely attributable to the company s community banking segment 
results of these tests have indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the past four years through since the testing commenced 
core deposit intangibles total million at december  compared to million one year earlier 
of the year end amounts  million represents the net un amortized value of the core deposit intangible created with the american commercial bank acquisition and million represents the net un amortized value of the core deposit intangible created upon the acquisition of ojai valley bank 
in connection with these acquisitions  the company recognizes core deposit intangibles that represent the fair value of long term deposit relationships acquired 
such amounts are then amortized over expected useful remaining economic lives 
during  the company adjusted the amortization rate of the core deposit intangible associated with the american commercial bank acquisition due to a greater retention rate of the original core deposit base than was originally contemplated at the time of the acquisition in no adjustments to the ojai valley bank related core deposit intangible have been necessary 
absent adjustments to the amortization schedules in future periods  the core deposit intangibles are now scheduled to be fully amortized in september with respect to the american commercial bank acquisition and october with respect to the ojai valley bank acquisition and the total amount of the amortization is projected to be thousand in this charge to expense is carried under other operating expense on the consolidated statements of income 
senior housing crime prevention foundation investment the bank owns a million holding of the preferred stock of senior housing crime prevention foundation investment corporation shcpf i which is carried under a separate caption on the consolidated statement of financial positions 
that investment is secured by a federal agency security issued by fnma 
the bank has the right after five years on april  to require shcpf to redeem all or a part of the shares of the preferred stock 
dividends are paid to the bank on the preferred stock at a rate which is below the interest earned on the underlying fnma agency security 
this differential is used by shcpf to fund the various programs of the senior housing crime prevention foundation at nursing home facilities in the bank s tri county service area 
these include  among other things  the senior crime stoppers program which is reducing crimes against the elderly living in those facilities 
the benefits to the bank of this program include full community reinvestment act cra credit for our million investment  positive public relations  and significant marketing opportunities with the operators of the facilities  their owners  board of directors  employees  family members and residents 
deposits while the bank is competitive with major institutions in terms of its structure of interest rates on deposit products offered  management was not aggressive during in terms of pricing to attract additional deposits  a decision which reflected the bank s liquidity through the year 
as discussed in the income statement analysis  many of the bank s deposit rates have risen in varying degrees in response to the general increase in rates 
a comparison of the rates paid on the bank s deposit products at december  and is as follows selected quoted interest rates change demand deposits now account better over  money market deposits over  passbook savings account individual retirement account year term time deposit  month term wall street journal prime rate average deposits have risen steadily over the past three years reflecting growth at the bank s existing offices and the acquisition of ojai valley bank on october  which had deposits of approximately million at the time of the acquisition 
below is a summary of the average deposits outstanding and the average rate paid by category over the last three years 
average average average dollars in s balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate interest bearing demand and money market investment accounts savings accounts time deposits total interest bearing deposits non interest bearing demand total deposits the majority of the bank s time deposits approximately have balances that are under  while all time deposits are somewhat more rate sensitive than the bank s other deposit categories  the smaller time deposit balances tend to be more stable and less sensitive to absolute rate levels than do time deposits of  or more 
approximately of the bank s time deposits mature within one year and would be potentially subject to a change in rate on their maturity date 
the following table as of december   displays summary size and maturity information on the bank s time deposits 
three after three after six dollars in s months or months to months to after balance by size less six months one year one year total under   or more total time deposits other borrowings while not a significant component of the bank s structure  other borrowings were million  at the end of compared to million at the end of these consist of borrowings under the us treasury tax and loan note account and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
the bank had outstanding borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively  under the us treasury tax and loan note account program 
the bank had two borrowings from the fhlb totaling million at december  and one for million at december  the two borrowings at the end of were structured as follows description issue date rate maturity principal fixed rate credit advance fixed rate credit advance total while the million borrowing above was specifically taken down to match fund a particular earning asset  the million borrowing funded general earning asset growth 
the company may increase its other borrowings during in an effort to diversify its funding sources and purchase earning assets which create a positive spread for the income statement  allowing it to more profitably leverage its strong capital base 
management had the ability at december  to borrow up to million of mostly shorter term borrowings up to five years from sources such as the fhlb 
funds raised from these sources may be used to fund earning assets such as investment securities or generate additional loans at sufficiently positive spreads to justify the additional leverage 
in january of  the company added million of additional borrowings in the form of a five year fixed rate credit advance at 
liquidity and capital resources the focus of the bank s liquidity management is to ensure its ability to meet cash requirements 
sources of liquidity include cash  due from bank balances net of federal reserve requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  fed funds sold  investment securities net of pledging requirements  loan repayments  deposits and fed funds borrowing lines 
typical demands on liquidity are deposit run off from demand deposits and savings accounts  maturing time deposits  which are not renewed  and anticipated funding under credit commitments to customers 
a review of liquidity provided by operating activities finds that this source has been relatively constant over the past three years at million  million and million in   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities has declined from million in to million in and million in reflecting a net drop over this period in new loans and investments made 
net cash provided by financing activities fell from million in to million in and million in the company experienced slower deposit growth over the last couple of years compared to the bank has adequate liquidity at the present time 
its loan to deposit ratio at year end was versus one year earlier 
the bank normally strives for a loan to deposit ratio in the to range 
the bank s internally calculated liquidity ratio stands at at december  compared to one year earlier 
these levels are above the bank s minimum policy of 
management is not aware of any trend  demand  commitment or event that would result in a material change in the bank s liquidity at the present time 
the company is dependent on the bank for dividend payments to conduct its stock repurchase program and to make dividends to its shareholders 
the company declared cash dividends during of  and repurchased stock totaling  the california financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the bank s undivided profits or the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years less the amount of any distributions made by the bank during such period 
based on these restrictions in the california financial code  the bank can make additional cash dividends totaling  at december  to the company 
the bank can also apply to the dfi for the ability to pay additional dividends to the company 
the bank and company expects to make such application during given the company s planned regular dividends and on going stock repurchase program 
given the bank s strong capital position  management does not expect such approval to be withheld 
indeed  at the bank s request  it received approval to pay  in dividends to the holding company in the fourth quarter of so that it would not risk violating the california financial code requirements noted above for capital ratios for commercial banks and their holding companies in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
the company and the bank are subject to certain standards concerning these ratios 
these standards were developed through the joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
further  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and certain other intangibles that a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio again uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the capital ratios at december  and  for both mid state bancshares and mid state bank trust 
additionally  the standards for a well capitalized institution  as defined by the federal banking agencies  are displayed 
minimum well capitalized mid state mid state regulatory regulatory bancshares bank trust standard standard leverage ratio tier one risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio while it is the intent of management to continue to maintain strong capital ratios  the board of directors has initiated a stock repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend payments in an effort to further leverage its equity and enhance shareholder value 
the company also may modestly increase its other borrowings as noted above under other borrowings and increase its capital leverage 
without deducting for goodwill and other intangibles from equity  two other commonly followed ratios related to capital have trended as follows over the past three years 
dividend payout ratio average common equity to average assets capital commitments as of december   neither the company nor the bank had any material commitment for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations as of december   the bank had the following contractual obligations 
less than one to three three to five over one year years years five years total long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations off balance sheet and other related party transactions as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letter of credit accommodations made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december   up from million one year earlier 
additionally  the company has un disbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling million  which was up from the million outstanding one year earlier 
the company has an allowance for losses unfunded commitments totaling  and  at december  and  respectively  to cover losses inherent in its letter of credit accommodations and un disbursed loan commitments 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by the company or the bank which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and un disbursed loan commitments 
as noted in footnote to the financial statements  the company does make loans and leases to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans and leases totaled million and million at the end of and  respectively 
in addition  there were un funded commitments to loan up to an additional  in extensions of credit to directors and executive officers at year end income statement analysis net interest income and interest rate risk net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on all earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  up from million recorded in and million in the components of net interest income change in response to both changes in rate  average balance and mix of both earning assets and liabilities

first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in higher yielding average loans  which were up by million  offset by declines in investments outstanding of million and fed funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
third  earning asset yields were higher in compared to the average for  and liability costs  while higher in also  did not increase as dramatically 
during there was a million increase in interest income along with a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the resulting million increase in net interest income for was a result of a number of dynamics affecting both average balance and interest rate considerations 
first  the company experienced an increase in its average earning assets outstanding of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in average loans  which were up by million  and to a lesser extent to an increase in average investments of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds sold of million 
second  while the company s average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  earning assets increased by a larger million 
third  earning asset yields were somewhat lower in compared to the average for and liability costs did not drop as quickly 
the bank expects its risk exposure to changes in interest rates during to remain manageable and well within acceptable policy ranges 
a recent review as of the end of of the potential changes in the bank s net interest income over a month time horizon showed that it could fluctuate under extreme alternative rate scenarios from between and of the base case rates unchanged of million 
the bank s policy is to maintain a structure of assets and liabilities which are such that net interest income will not vary more than plus or minus of the base forecast over the next months 
management expects that its exposure to interest rate risk is manageable and it will continue to strive for an optimal trade off between risk and earnings 
the following table presents a summary of the bank s net interest income forecasted for the coming months under alternative interest rate scenarios 
change from base rates down very significant prime down from to over months rates down significant prime down from to over months rates down modestly prime down from to over months base case rates unchanged prime unchanged at over months rates up modestly prime up from to over months rates up aggressive prime up from to over months rates up very aggressive prime up from to over months net interest income under the above scenarios is influenced by the characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
in the case of now  savings and money market deposits total billion interest is based on rates set at the discretion of management ranging from to 
in a downward rate environment  there is a limit to how far these deposit instruments can be re priced and this behavior is similar to that of fixed rate instruments 
in an upward rate environment  the magnitude and timing of changes in rates on these deposits is assumed to be more reflective of variable rate instruments 
it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitors behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior  and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the bank s net interest income 
therefore the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
historically  the bank has been able to manage its net interest income in a fairly narrow range reflecting the bank s relative insensitivity to interest rate changes 
the impact of prepayment behavior on mortgages  real estate loans  mortgage backed securities  securities with call features  etc 
is not considered material to the sensitivity analysis 
over the last years  the bank s net interest margin which is net interest income divided by average earning assets of the bank has ranged from a low of to a high of not taxable equivalent 
the bank s net interest margin in of was just below the middle of this range by historical standards  coming off the low levels experienced in and of and  respectively 
the improvement in the net interest margin in is a result of both the higher level of interest rates and the change in mix of earning assets the bank now has a higher portion in loans vis vis investment securities compared to when the margin was at its lowest level 
the net interest margin under the alternative scenarios ranges from to 
management feels this range of scenarios is consistent with current experience and interest rate levels  but no assurances can be given that actual future experience will fall within this range 
the bank s exposure with respect to interest rate derivatives  exchange rate fluctuations  and or commodity price movements is nil 
the bank does not own any instruments within these markets 
provision for loan losses the company did not make a provision to the allowance for loan losses during in and however  it reduced the allowance for loan losses by million and thousand  respectively  through a benefit to the provision for loan losses 
these actions over the past three years reflected strong credit quality standards  consistent performance of the loan portfolio in recent years  improving trends in classified loans  improving trends in delinquencies  an improved outlook for the collection of the company s non accrual loans  the reduced absolute level of non accrual loans and the outlook for economic activity in general 
the need for additional provision for loan losses or for further benefit to the provision for loan losses in will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
non interest income non interest income for totaled million compared to million in and million in service charges on deposit accounts decreased million to million in compared to following an increase of million to million in versus the decrease in compared to reflects primarily a decline in account analysis charges collected in the face of higher earnings credits for compensating balances posted to customer accounts in the higher rate environment compared to the prior year 
the increase in compared to primarily reflects the implementation of a new decision plan module for handling non sufficient fund and overdraft accounts and the merger with ojai valley bank 
commissions  fees and other service charges decreased by million in to million 
this followed a decrease of million in over the decrease in is a result of outsourcing its merchant credit card processing functions approximately million offset by improvements to other categories  especially debit card fees million  letter of credit commissions million and trust department income million 
the company now receives a payment for merchant credit card processing which is net of expenses  so a similar decline was experienced in the non interest expense section of the income statement 
the decrease in compared to also related primarily to a drop in merchant credit card processing income as a result of outsourcing this activity late in the year 
gains on sales of securities decreased to thousand in following thousand and thousand gains in and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as  disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management believes that the most significant subjective judgements that it is required to make include the following allowance for losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance and also employs an independent third party loan review group to  among other things  review the adequacy of the allowance and make recommendations 
management  as necessary  adjusts the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses unfunded commitments 
these adjustments are made through a charge to expense or a benefit in the provision for loan losses on the income statement 
the allowance is also examined annually by one or more of the bank s regulatory bodies including the fdic and dfi 
the need for additional provision for loan losses in  or a benefit to the provision for loan losses  will be dependent upon management s on going analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
while management believes it to be adequate at the present time  the appropriate value can fluctuate over time in response to economic conditions and the subjective decisions which must be made in response to those conditions 
fair value 
where applicable  the company is required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to disclose the fair value of financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate those fair values 
also  the fair value calculated on collateral supporting the bank s extensions of credit eg appraisals on the property securing real estate loans can have a significant effect on the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for losses noted above 
wherever possible  fair value used by the company equals quoted market price  as for example with its investment securities portfolio  if available 
if it is not available  fair value is estimated by the company using quoted market prices for similar assets 
fair value of other instruments involves discounting future cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturity and credit characteristics 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value
