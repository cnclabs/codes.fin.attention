table of contents company overview aflac incorporated the parent company and its subsidiaries the company primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the united states and japan 
the company s insurance business is marketed and administered through american family life assurance company of columbus aflac  which operates in the united states aflac us and as a branch in japan aflac japan 
most of aflac s policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents 
our insurance operations in the united states and our branch in japan service the two markets for our insurance business 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended december  as a result  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes 
prior year results have been adjusted to reflect adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  on january  for additional information  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this md a is divided into four primary sections 
in the first section  we discuss our critical accounting estimates 
we then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment 
the third section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion of market risks of financial instruments 
we conclude by addressing the availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash in the capital resources and liquidity section 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations 
the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of aflac s results of operations and financial condition are those related to investments  deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities 
the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management s analyses and judgments 
the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which of our assets and of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity 
subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly differ ent results 
ii 
table of contents investments investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities 
for privately issued securities  we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each security s credit quality and liquidity characteristics 
we also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of distressed investments  the determination of fair value if not publicly traded  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and require evaluation of factors  including but not limited to percentage decline in value and the length of time during which the decline has occurred recoverability of principal and interest market conditions ability to hold the investment to maturity review of the issuer s overall operating performance rating agency opinions and actions regarding the issuer s credit standing adverse changes in the issuer s availability of production resources  revenue sources and technological conditions adverse changes in the issuer s economic  regulatory or political environment deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities aflac s products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity contracts 
as such  our products are accounted for under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
we make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business in order to match expected policy benefits and expenses with expected policy premiums 
these assumptions include persistency  morbidity  mortality  investment yields and expenses 
if actual results mirror the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs  profits will emerge as a level percentage of earned premiums 
however  because actual results will vary from the assumptions  profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year 
we measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs dac annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business 
our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our dac is recoverable 
ii 
table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs under the requirements of sfas no 
 certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy s premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income 
future amortization of dac is based upon our estimates of persistency  interest  and future premium revenue at time of policy issuance 
however  the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency 
as presented in the following table  the ratio of unamortized dac to annualized premiums in force has been relatively stable for aflac us and aflac japan over the last three years 
deferred policy acquisition cost ratios aflac japan aflac us in yen in dollars in millions deferred policy acquisition costs annualized premiums in force deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force policy liabilities our policy liabilities  which are determined in accordance with sfas no 
and actuarial standards of practice  include two primary components future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims  which accounted for and of total policy liabilities as of december   respectively 
future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums 
we calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity  mortality  persistency and interest 
these assumptions are established at the time a policy is issued 
the assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy 
as required by gaap  we also include a provision for adverse deviation  which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience 
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us 
we compute unpaid policy claims on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments  adjusted for current trends and changed conditions 
assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims are updated regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability 
claims incurred under aflac s policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame 
they are sensitive to frequency and severity of claims 
they are not  however  subject to medical cost inflation because benefits are based on a fixed indemnity 
our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders 
ii 
table of contents in computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims  we consider many factors  including the benefits and amounts available under the policy  the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims  and internal business practices  such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices 
we monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges 
claim levels are generally stable from period to period  however  fluctuations in claim levels may occur 
in calculating the unpaid policy claim liability  we do not calculate a range of estimates 
however  if current period claims were to change by  we would expect the unpaid policy claim liability to change by approximately million 
the following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of december policy liabilities in millions us segment future policy benefits unpaid policy claims other policy liabilities total us policy liabilities japan segment future policy benefits unpaid policy claims other policy liabilities total japan policy liabilities consolidated future policy benefits unpaid policy claims other policy liabilities total consolidated policy liabilities new accounting pronouncements during the last three years  various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements  interpretations and exposure drafts on issues  including equity based compensation  pensions  variable interest entities  special purpose entities  derivatives  intangible assets and business combinations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  such as granting stock options 
it requires that companies use a fair value method to value share based awards and recognize the related compensation expense in net earnings 
we adopted sfas r january   using the modified retrospective application method 
as a result  prior year results have been adjusted to reflect the expensing of share based awards 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ii 
table of contents in november  the fasb issued staff position number fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in fsp amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and was effective january  we do not expect the adoption of this staff position to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
sop provides accounting guidance on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
retrospective application of this sop to previously issued financial statements is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this sop on our accounting for internal replacements 
for additional information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact  if any  on our financial position or results of operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table is a presentation of items impacting net earnings and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended december items impacting net earnings in millions per diluted share net earnings items impacting net earnings  net of tax realized investment gains losses impact from sfas release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets japanese pension obligation transfer ii 
table of contents realized investment gains and losses our investment strategy is to invest in fixed income securities in order to provide a reliable stream of investment income  which is one of the drivers of the company s profitability 
we do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses 
however  investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers 
the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products  which are the principal drivers of our profitability 
in  we realized pretax gains of million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share 
the significant realized investment gains in primarily resulted from the execution of bond swaps in the third and fourth quarters that took advantage of tax loss carryforwards 
these bond swaps also improved overall portfolio credit quality and investment income 
during the third quarter of  we received an issuer s offer to redeem certain available for sale yen denominated debt securities held by the company 
we accepted the issuer s offer of million and recorded a pretax loss of million 
this investment loss and other investment gains and losses in the normal course of business decreased pretax earnings by million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share 
realized investment losses in related primarily to the sale of our investment in parmalat at a pretax loss of million 
we also sold our investment in levi strauss at a pretax loss of million 
these investment losses and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased pretax earnings by million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share 
impact from sfas we entered into cross currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar denominated senior debt obligation  which matures in  into a yen denominated obligation see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of issuing fixed rate  dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate  yen denominated debt has the same economic impact on aflac as if we had issued yen denominated debt of a like amount 
however  the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated samurai notes 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swap  which does not qualify for hedge accounting  be reflected in net earnings other income 
this change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results o f operations 
at maturity  the swaps fair value and their initial contract fair value will be equal  and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero 
we have the ability and intent to retain the cross currency swaps until their maturity 
the impact from sfas includes the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swaps  which does not qualify for hedge accounting 
ii 
table of contents we have also issued yen denominated samurai notes 
we have designated billion yen of these notes as a hedge of our investment in aflac japan 
if the value of these yen denominated notes and the cross currency swaps exceeds our investment in aflac japan  we would be required to recognize the foreign currency effect on the excess  or ineffective portion  in net earnings other income 
the ineffective portion would be included in the impact from sfas these hedges were effective during the three year period ended december   therefore  there was no impact on net earnings 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
nonrecurring items we received regulatory approval for a change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between aflac and the parent company in this enabled the parent company to fully utilize its tax basis  non life operating losses and therefore release the valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit of million 
per diluted share in the american jobs creation act of eliminated the limitation on the utilization of foreign tax credits 
as a result of this tax law change  we recognized a benefit of million 
per diluted share in for the release of the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets 
the and tax benefits are included as reductions to income tax expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 
during  we concluded the process of returning the substitutional portion of aflac japan s pension plan to the japanese government as allowed by the japan pension insurance law 
we recognized a one time gain other income as the result of this transfer to the japanese government in the amount of million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share in for additional information on the transfer  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency translation aflac japan s premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen 
claims and expenses are paid in yen  and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities 
these and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes 
we translate aflac japan s yen denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period  and we translate its yen denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period 
however  it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency 
except for a limited number of transactions  we do not actually convert yen into dollars 
ii 
table of contents due to the size of aflac japan  where our functional currency is the japanese yen  fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results 
in periods when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported 
when the yen strengthens  translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported 
consequently  yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year  while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year 
as a result  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders 
because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations  management evaluates aflac s financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
income taxes our combined us and japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was in  in and in total income taxes were million in  compared with million in and million in the lower than normal income tax rate primarily resulted from the release of the valuation allowance for non life losses in our effective income tax rate and tax expense were impacted by the release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets discussed previously 
japanese income taxes on aflac japan s results accounted for most of our consolidated income tax expense 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
earnings guidance we communicate earnings guidance in this report based on the growth in net earnings per diluted share 
however  certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management s control may have a significant impact on actual results 
therefore  our comparison of net earnings includes certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings 
in comparing year over year results  we exclude the effect of realized investment gains and losses  the impact from sfas and nonrecurring items 
we also assume no impact from foreign currency translation on the aflac japan segment and the parent company s yen denominated interest expense for a given year in relation to the prior year 
subject to the preceding assumptions  our objective for was to achieve net earnings per diluted share of at least  an increase of 
based on net earnings per diluted share of  adjusted for realized investment gains 
per diluted share  the impact from sfas a loss of 
per diluted share  the release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a gain of 
per diluted share and foreign currency translation a loss of 
per diluted share  we met our objective for the year 
our objective for is to achieve net earnings per diluted share of at least  an increase of over using the preceding assumptions 
if we achieve this objective  the following table shows the likely results for net earnings per diluted share  including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen dollar exchange rate scenarios

table of contents net earnings per share eps scenarios weighted average yen dollar net earnings per growth yen impact exchange rate diluted share over on eps excludes realized investment gains losses  impact from sfas and nonrecurring items in and  and assumes no impact from currency translation in actual weighted average exchange rate our objective for had been to increase net earnings per diluted share by to  on the basis described above 
however  based on the development of our business  we now expect net earnings per diluted share to increase by to  on the basis described above 
insurance operations aflac s insurance business consists of two segments aflac japan and aflac us aflac japan  which operates as a branch of aflac  is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings 
gaap financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual financial statements 
furthermore  we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain revenue and expense items  and segment assets 
we measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis 
we define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses  the impact from sfas  and nonrecurring items 
we believe that an analysis of segment pretax operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business 
furtherm ore  because a significant portion of our business is conducted in japan  we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into us dollars 
we evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales  an industry operating measure 
total new annualized premium sales  which include new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions  represent the premiums that we would collect over a month period  assuming the policies remain in force 
premium income  or earned premiums  is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period 
ii

ii 
table of contents the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of in  in  and in  reflect the high persistency of aflac japan s business and the sales of new policies 
annualized premiums in force at december   were trillion yen  compared with billion yen in  and billion yen in annualized premiums in force  translated into dollars at respective year end exchange rates  were billion in  billion in  and billion in the benefit ratio has declined over the past several years  reflecting the impact of newer products with lower loss ratios 
we have also experienced favorable claim trends in our major product lines 
we expect the benefit ratio to continue to decline in future years primarily reflecting the shift to newer products and riders 
however  this decline is partially offset by the effects of low investment yields  which affect our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves see table and discussion on 
page ii 
the operating expense ratio increased in as a result of additional advertising expenditures and the write off of previously capitalized systems development costs 
we expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively stable in as we continue our investment in systems development 
due to improvement in the b enefit ratio  the pretax operating profit margin expanded to in we expect a modest expansion in the profit margin in and aflac japan maintains a portfolio of dollar denominated and reverse dual currency securities yen denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments 
dollar denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately of aflac japan s investment income in  compared with in and in in years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar  translating aflac japan s dollar denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income  total operating revenues  and pretax operating earnings in yen terms 
in years when the yen weakens  translating dollar denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income  total operating revenues  and pretax operating earnings in yen terms 
the following table illustrates the effect of translating aflac japan s dollar denominated investment income and related items by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been r eported had yen dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year

table of contents aflac japan sales for  sales increased in yen  which was in line with our objective of to growth for the year 
we saw strong sales results in our stand alone medical product category and from cancer life sales through dai ichi mutual life 
however  as expected  sales continued to be affected by sharp declines in rider max sales 
the following table presents aflac japan s total new annualized premium sales for the years ended december in dollars in yen in millions of dollars and billions of yen total new annualized premium sales increase over prior year aflac japan s sales mix has been shifting during the last few years 
the following table details the contributions to total new annualized premium sales by major product for the years ended december medical policies rider max cancer life ordinary life other total our medical products  which include our ever product line  sustained strong sales growth in with continued cost pressure on japan s health care system  we expect demand for medical products will continue to rise in the future and we remain encouraged about the outlook for the medical insurance market 
although that market is very competitive  aflac japan retains the distinction of being the number one seller of stand alone medical insurance in japan 
we believe that our number one status provides us with a distinct advantage in the marketplace 
as a result  we continue to believe that the medical category will be an important part of our product portfolio 
as we have disclosed previously  we expect rider max conversions and sales to continue to decline in future periods 
conversion activity accounted for approximately of total rider max sales in  compared with in and in for policy conversions  new annualized premium sales include only the incremental annualized premium amount over the original term policy 
we expect that conversions will continue to decline in future periods 
cancer life sales benefited from a new product introduction in  as well as our program that converted payroll policies to a direct billing mode 
our cancer life policies are also marketed by dai ichi mutual life

table of contents for  we expect to generate solid sales growth from our medical products 
however  we anticipate that lower rider max sales and weaker conversions will continue to restrain sales growth 
as a result  our objective for is to increase total new annualized premium sales in yen by to 
we continued to focus on the growth of our distribution system in japan 
during  the number of licensed sales associates rose to approximately  compared with  at december  the growth of licensed sales associates resulted primarily from individual agency recruitment 
in  we recruited  agencies  compared with our goal of  agencies 
we believe that new agencies and sales associates will continue to be attracted to aflac japan s high commissions  superior products  customer service and brand image 
furthermore  we believe that these new agencies and associates will enable us to further expand our reach in the japanese market 
aflac japan investments growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations  yields on new investments  and the effect of yen dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income 
aflac japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than japanese government or other corporate bonds would have provided  while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality 
all of our privately issued securities are rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
these securities are generally issued with standard documentation for medium term note programs and have appropriate covenants

japanese economy recent events indicate that japan s economy has begun to recover 
the bank of japan s january monthly report of recent economic financial developments indicates continued increases in exports  an upward trend in industrial production  and continued increases in capital expenditures and household income 
the same report also expressed the bank of japan s opinion that the economy is expected to continue a steady recovery trend 
this opinion is based on expectations of increases in domestic private demand and exports  while issues such as excess corporate debt are dissipating 
nevertheless  the time required for a full economic recovery remains uncertain 
ii 
table of contents japan s system of compulsory public health care insurance provides medical coverage to every japanese citizen 
these public medical expenditures are covered by a combination of premiums paid by insureds and their employers  taxes  and copayments from the people who receive medical service 
however  given japan s aging population  the resources available to these publicly funded social insurance programs have come under increasing pressure and as a result  copayments have been rising and affecting more people 
in  copayments were raised from to and additional reforms are being considered for and we believe the trend of higher copayments will lead more consumers to purchase supplemental insurance plans 
many insurance companies have recognized the opportunities for selling supplemental insurance in japan and have launched new products in recent years 
however  we believe our favorable cost structure compared with other insurers makes us a very effe ctive competitor 
in addition  we believe our brand  customer service  and financial strength also benefit our market position

the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force

annualized premiums in force at december were billion in  billion in  and billion in ii 
table of contents the benefit ratio has increased slightly over the past several years  primarily due to the impact of declining investment yields on the growth of our investment income 
as a percentage of premium income  the benefit ratio has been fairly stable at in  in and in we expect the benefit ratio to decline slightly in future periods due to favorable claim cost trends 
we also expect the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary promotional expenses  to remain relatively stable 
the pretax operating profit margin is expected to improve modestly in overall  the financial effect from hurricanes in was not material 
in early september  we announced that we were allowing a day grace period for premium payments in the hurricane affected areas as defined by the federal emergency management agency 
additionally  the insurance departments in louisiana  mississippi and alabama have mandated various grace periods for the affected areas  some of which extended into early in  we saw a modest increase in policy terminations in the areas impacted by the hurricanes 
however  these additional terminations did not have a material impact on our financial results 
aflac us sales we were pleased with the sales results of aflac us for  sales increased  which met our objective of to growth for the year 
our accident disability and cancer expense products were again the primary contributors to sales 
the following table presents aflac s us total new annualized premium sales for the years ended december in millions total new annualized premium sales increase over prior year our objective for is to increase total new annualized premium sales by to 
one aspect of our growth strategy is the continued enhancement of our product line

other operations corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation  benefits  and facilities expenses 
corporate expenses  excluding investment income  were million in  million in and million in investment income included in reported corporate expenses was million in  and million in both and the increase in the corporate expenses was primarily the result of increased expenses associated with our retirement obligations 
analysis of financial condition our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations during the last two years 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one dollar  or weaker than the december   exchange rate of 
the weaker yen decreased reported investments and cash by billion  total assets by billion  and total liabilities by billion  compared with the amounts that would have been reported for if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from december  market risks of financial instruments because we invest in fixed income securities  our financial instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks currency risk and interest rate risk 
ii 
table of contents currency risk the functional currency of aflac japan s insurance operation is the japanese yen 
all of aflac japan s premiums  claims and commissions are received or paid in yen  as are most of its investment income and other expenses 
furthermore  most of aflac japan s investments  cash and liabilities are yen denominated 
when yen denominated securities mature or are sold  the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities 
aflac japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations 
in addition  aflac incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its dollar denominated senior notes 
although we generally do not convert yen into dollars  we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on a consolidated basis  we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations 
we accomplish this by investing a portion of aflac japan s investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities  by the parent company s issuance of yen denominated debt and by the use of cross currency swaps see hedging activities on 
page ii for additional information 
as a result  the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is mitigated 
at december  consolidated yen denominated net assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation were million in and million in aflac japan s yen denominated net assets were billion at both december  and aflac incorporated s yen denominated net liabilities were billion at december   and billion at december  the following table demonstrates th e effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen denominated assets and liabilities  and our consolidated yen denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of december ii

this primarily occurs when we transfer funds from aflac japan to aflac us  which is done annually

these repatriations have not been greater than of aflac japan s prior year fsa based earnings 
a portion of the repatriation may be used to service aflac incorporated s yen denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars 
ii 
table of contents interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure is to the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities 
we use modified duration analysis  which measures price percentage volatility  to estimate the sensitivity of fair values to interest rate changes on debt securities we own 
for example  if the current duration of a debt security is  then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points  assuming all other factors remain constant 
likewise  the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately if market interest rates increase by basis points  assuming all other factors remain constant 
the estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt securities we own  notes payable  cross currency swaps and our obligation for the japanese policyholder protection fund as of december follows sensitivity of fair values of financial instruments to interest rate changes fair basis fair basis in millions value points value points debt securities fixed maturity securities yen denominated dollar denominated perpetual debentures yen denominated dollar denominated total debt securities notes payable cross currency swap liabilities japanese policyholder protection fund excludes capitalized lease obligations changes in the interest rate environment have contributed to the unrealized gains on debt securities we own 
however  we do not expect to realize a majority of these unrealized gains because we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
likewise  should significant amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields  we would not expect to realize these losses because we have the intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity 
for additional information on unrealized losses on debt securities  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
ii 
table of contents we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities 
for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years is longer than that of the related invested assets due to the unavailability of acceptable long duration yen denominated securities 
the following table presents the approximate duration of our yen denominated assets and liabilities  along with premiums  as of december in years yen denominated debt securities policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years premiums to be received in future years on policies in force the following table shows a comparison of average required interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields  based on amortized cost  for the years ended december comparison of interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields net of investment expenses us japan us japan us japan policies issued during year required interest on policy reserves new money yield on investments policies in force during year required interest on policy reserves return on average invested assets represents yen denominated investments for aflac japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes aflac japan s annuities  and dollar denominated investments and related investment income in response to low interest rates in the united states  we lowered our required interest assumption for newly issued products to in in japan  we also lowered our required interest assumption for some newly issued products to 
however  the majority of japan s newly issued products have a required interest assumption of 
we continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the united states and japan and will re evaluate those assumptions as necessary 
over the next two years  we have several yen denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of aflac japan s current net investment yield of 
these securities total million at amortized cost and have an average yield of 
these maturities will contribute to a continued decline in our overall portfolio yield 
currently  when debt securities we own mature  the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  adding riders to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread 
and despite negative investment spreads  adequate overall profit margins still exist in aflac japan s aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable experience from mortality  morbidity  and expenses 
ii 
table of contents investments and cash our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity  safety and quality 
our investment objective  subject to appropriate risk constraints  is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity 
we seek to achieve this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports 
aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets 
our investment activities expose us to credit risk  which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
however  we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality 
we accomplish this by considering our product needs and overall corporate objectives  in addition to credit risk 
our investment policy requires that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
in evaluating the initial rating  we look at the overall senior issuer rating  the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class  and  where applicable  the appropriate designation from the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
in addition  we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities

page ii for additional information 
ii 
table of contents we have investments in both publicly issued and privately issued securities 
however  the status of issuance should not be viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of fair value 
the outstanding amount of a particular issuance  as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and the state of the market  including credit events and the interest rate environment  affect liquidity regardless of type of issuance 
we routinely assess the fair value of all of our investments 
this process includes evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources  as described more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

reverse dual currency debt securities accounted for billion  or  of total privately issued securities as of december   compared with billion  or  at december  aflac japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than those available from japanese government bonds 
aflac japan s investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non japanese issuers and have longer maturities  thereby allowing us to improve our asset liability matching and our overall investment returns 
most of our privately issued securities are i ssued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings  except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments 
furthermore  we use several methods to monitor these criteria  including credit rating services and internal credit analysis 
all of our securities have ratings from either a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or the svo of the naic 
the distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended december  based on acquisition cost  were as follows ii 
table of contents composition of purchases by credit rating aaa aa a bbb total the distributions of debt securities we own  by credit rating  were as follows composition by credit rating december  december  amortized fair amortized fair cost value cost value aaa aa a bbb bb or lower total the increase in below investment grade securities primarily resulted from credit rating downgrades of the securities of two us issuers 
in the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status  we do not automatically liquidate our position 
however  if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio  we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the security s fair value and its unrealized gain loss are reflected on the balance sheet 
once we designate a security as below investment grade  we intensify our monitoring of the issuer 
we do not automatically recognize an impairment for the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
our investment management starts by reviewing its credit analysis 
included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer  its current credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the issuer 
we then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing sources 
upon determining the fair value  we move our focus to an analysis of whether or not the decline in fair value  if any  is other than temporary 
for securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value  investment management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated 
the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed more fully in the critical accounting estimates section on

this occurs when one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade 
our policy is to review each issue on a case by case basis to determine if a split rated security should be classified as investment grade or below investment grade

ii 
table of contents hedging activities aflac has limited hedging activities 
our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in aflac japan  which is affected by changes in the yen dollar exchange rate 
in order to mitigate this exposure  we have taken the following courses of action 
first  aflac japan owns dollar denominated securities  which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in aflac japan 
second  we have designated the parent company s yen denominated liabilities samurai notes payable and cross currency swaps as a hedge of our investment in aflac japan 
if the total of these yen denominated liabilities is equal to or less than our net investment in aflac japan  the hedge is deemed to be effective and the related exchange effect is reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income 
should these yen denominated liabilities exceed our investment in aflac japan  the portion of the hedge that exceeds our investment in aflac japan would be deemed ineffective 
as required by sfas no 
 we would then recognize the foreign exchange effect on the ineffective portion in net earnings other income 
we estimate that if the ineffective portion was million  we would report a foreign exchange gain loss of approximately million for every one yen weakening strengthening in the end of period yen dollar exchange rate 
at december   and  our hedge was effective with yen denominated assets exceeding yen denominated liabilities by billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
in  we chose not to increase our hedge for the increase in our yen denominated net asset position 
capital resources and liquidity aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the parent company through dividends and management fees 
aflac declared dividends to the parent company in the amount of million in  compared with million in and million in during  aflac paid million to the parent company for management fees  compared with million in and million in the increase in management fees in resulted from the previously discussed change in the allocation of expenses under the management fee agreement between aflac and the parent company 
the primary uses of cash by the parent company are shareholder dividends and our share repurchase program 
the parent company s sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future 
the parent company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital 
capital is primarily used to fund business expansion  capital expenditures and our share repurchase program 
in  we filed a shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to billion yen of samurai notes in japan 
in july  we issued billion yen approximately million of these securities with a coupon of 
and a five year maturity 
these securities are not available to us persons or entities 
the remaining billion yen of the shelf registration statement expired in december as a result  in february we filed a new shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to billion yen approximately million using the december   exchange rate of samurai notes in japan 
if issued  these securities will not be available to us persons or entities 
we believe outsid e sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available 
ii 
table of contents the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
the primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
when making an investment decision  our first consideration is based on product needs 
our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities 
these objectives also take into account duration matching  and because of the long term nature of our business  we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs 
in general  our insurance products provide fixed benefit amounts that are not subject to medical cost inflation 
furthermore  our business is widely dispersed in both the united states and japan 
this geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature 
additionally  our insurance policies generally are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
as a result of policyholder aging  claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy 
therefore  future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments 
we expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses 
the following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of december  we translated our yen denominated obligations using the december   exchange rate 
actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen dollar exchange rate 
distribution of payments by period less total total than one to four to after in millions liability payments one year three years five years five years future policy benefits liability unpaid policy claims liability long term debt principal long term debt interest policyholder protection fund operating service agreements operating lease obligations capitalized lease obligations total contractual obligations liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the distribution of payments for future policy benefits is an estimate of all future benefit payments for policies in force as of december  these projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency  mortality and morbidity 
the distribution of payments for unpaid policy claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims 
actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above 
we anticipate that the future policy benefit liability of billion at december   along with future net premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments 
ii 
table of contents consolidated cash flows we translate cash flows for aflac japan s yen denominated items into us dollars using weighted average exchange rates 
in years when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported 
when the yen strengthens  translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported

investing activities operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations 
the following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended december cash provided used by investing activities in millions aflac japan aflac us and other operations cash flows for aflac us and other operations were impacted by the january return of cash collateral from the security lending activities of aflac us at the end of approximately billion 
ii 
table of contents prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities 
for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years is longer than that of the related invested assets due to the unavailability of acceptable long duration yen denominated securities 
currently  when debt securities we own mature  the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  the long term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provides us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses 
when market opportunities arise  we dispose of selected debt securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and or improve future investment yields 
as a result  disposi tions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year 
dispositions before maturity were of the annual average investment portfolio of debt securities available for sale during the year ended december   compared with in and in the increase in dispositions before maturity primarily resulted from the bond swaps we executed in the third and fourth quarters of financing activities consolidated cash used by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  we received net proceeds of million in connection with the issuance of samurai notes due in and paid in full the samurai notes at their maturity 
cash provided by investment type contracts increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the following table presents a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended december in millions treasury stock purchases shares purchased stock issued from treasury shares issued the dividend of

table of contents regulatory restrictions aflac is domiciled in nebraska and is subject to its regulations 
the nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to the parent company 
the nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations  which excludes net realized investment gains  for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles  or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the naic  as modified by the insurance departmen t in the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
the continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations 
aflac s insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
the naic s risk based capital rbc formula is used by insurance regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance companies 
the rbc formula quantifies insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s rbc ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position 
currently  the naic has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the rbc formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products  investments  and other actuarial a nd accounting matters 
we believe that we will continue to maintain a strong rbc ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  japan s fsa may not allow transfers of funds from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders 
the fsa maintains its own solvency standard 
aflac japan s solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums 
payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac us for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings 
in  expenses allocated to aflac japan were million  million in and million in during  aflac japan also remitted profits of million billion yen to aflac us  compared with million billion yen in and million billion yen in profits remitted in were lower primarily as a result of realized investment losses recognized in for additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends  profit transfers and other remittances  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
