item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview general the company has three reportable operating segments its traditional business which manufactures and sells precured tread rubber  equipment and supplies for retreading tires  tire distribution systems  inc tds which sells and maintains retread tires and new tires to principally commercial and industrial customers and speedco  inc which provides quick service truck lubrication and routine tire service through company owned on highway locations in the united states 
bandag and its licensees have franchise locations worldwide  with located in the united states and internationally 
the majority of bandag s franchisees are independent operators of full service tire distributorships and the remaining are owned by either gcr  a bridgestone wholly owned company  or by tds 
the traditional business revenues primarily come from the sale of retread material and equipment to its franchisees 
tds offers complete tire management services including the complete line of bandag retreads  new tires commercial  retail and off the road  alignment and hour road service 
speedco provides quick service truck lubrication and routine tire service 
bandag anticipates strengthening speedco s success by adding more locations and tire capability while not compromising speedco s deserved reputation for convenient  quick  quality service 
a major component of the expansion is to modify all existing locations and build new locations to include a bandag designed and developed high speed tire sales and service capability 
it is anticipated that most new locations will be built with a minimum of two high speed tire lanes 
the majority of the current locations are being modified to include two tire lanes with the exception of those locations where current sites are not large enough to add two lanes and the adjoining property is unavailable or cost prohibitive 
speedco had  in capital expenditures in and anticipates capital expenditures of  to  in bandag anticipates that the costs associated with the start up of new locations and the expansion of tire lanes at existing locations will continue to put pressure on speedco margins and costs which may offset the positive contribution of speedco 
approximately of bandag s retread material sales in north america come from national account contracts with a variety of major fleets 
the depth of the company s franchisee network combined with the quality of its products has allowed bandag to build a significant national account business 
significant fleet revenue is important to bandag s franchisees who act with bandag as subcontractors to deliver products  information and services to national fleet customers 
bandag s franchise agreements require its franchisees to buy their precured retreading material and equipment from bandag  which gives bandag a secure revenue stream 
growth in revenue can be achieved by expanding the amount of services that can be provided to a fleet by bandag and its franchisees while continuing to provide value added retread products 
bandag also generates significant cash flow which has historically been used to reinvest in the business  make debt payments  pay dividends  repurchase stock and other corporate purposes 
despite an aggressive push by competitors in the unites states retread business  bandag has retained its leading position 
in addition to its leading presence in the united states  bandag also has an important presence internationally in europe  canada  mexico  brazil  south africa and australia 
trucking industry while shippers apply pressure to fleets from the service side  pressure on fleets from the cost side continues to intensify 
high insurance costs  increased driver wages  new hours of service hos rules  and higher fuel costs continue to increase the pressure on fleets to find ways to reduce costs 
the pressure to reduce costs and still meet shipper demands requires fleets to focus on increasing revenue through better asset utilization 
fleets are looking for ways to reduce costs and to reduce the assets that are used to generate revenues 
they are focusing  not just on reduction of downtime  but on better utilization of downtime that is mandated through regulation eg when the truck is down due to regulated driver rest time  fleets will seek to use that time for vehicle maintenance 
fleets  particularly truckload carriers  will likely focus more on preventive maintenance and other services and products  such as those provided by bandag  that can provide more reliable utilization of their assets 
new tire retread pricing and profitability the relationship between new tire pricing and retread unit pricing has been narrowing primarily due to retread unit prices increasing at a faster rate than new tires and lower priced imported new tires entering the market 
generally  a decreasing new tire to retread price ratio will put downward pressure on retread pricing and tend to increase the use of relatively less expensive new tires instead of retreads 
increases in imports of low priced new tires and the movement of major new tire manufacturers to lower their costs by utilizing overseas production has exacerbated this situation 
however  there still remains an inherent value in retreading to fleets that recognize the need for a well managed tire program that combines quality new tires  retreads and tire management services to reduce operating costs 
acquisitions on february   the company acquired an majority interest in speedco  inc from its founders and equilon enterprises  llc  a royal dutch shell group company 
in total  bandag paid approximately  net of cash received  for its interest and to assume and retire  of debt 
the company recorded  of goodwill and  of other intangible assets 
on june   speedco  inc acquired the assets of six licensed locations  which were owned and operated by pm express  inc speedco paid approximately  net of cash acquired  for these assets 
the company recorded  of goodwill 
during  the company s tds segment acquired one retread plant and five commercial and retail outlets for  during  the company s tds segment acquired seven commercial and retail outlets and two retread plants for  sale of tds locations bandag s tds subsidiary sold or closed one location during  locations during and locations during the company considers tds to be essential in order to protect bandag s distribution where no independent bandag franchise exists 
bandag will continue to divest tds locations where an independent bandag dealer is willing to buy the location and when it is a sensible decision for the company to sell 
bandag will also continue to purchase locations for tds if it is necessary to maintain bandag s distribution in an area 
in currently unprofitable locations where tds must operate to maintain bandag s presence to serve its fleet customers  the company intends to continue to improve operational efficiencies to achieve profitability 
during  the company s tds segment sold locations with a net carrying value of  for cash of  and assumed liabilities of  the assets of these locations consisted primarily of inventory and property  plant and equipment 
the divestitures resulted in a loss before income taxes and minority interest of  which was recorded in engineering  selling  administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
during  tds also closed two locations 
the and divested and closed locations had net sales and loss before income taxes and minority interest as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales   loss before income taxes and minority interest  outsourcing agreement on may  bandag announced that yellow roadway corporation elected on april  not to renew the existing bandag outsourcing agreement for roadway express tire and wheel services in place since and  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  would be repurchasing the tire and wheel assets from bandag 
on july  bandag received an initial payment of approximately  and received a final payment of approximately  on july  these tire and wheel assets had net carrying values of approximately  and  as of june  and december   respectively  and were classified with other current assets in the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets 
bandag s annual revenues under the contract in  including revenue derived from sales of retread materials to dealers performing services under the agreement  were approximately  bandag estimated that the agreement contributed approximately  to consolidated net earnings in  or approximately per diluted share 
the foregoing discussion concerning the economic contribution attributable to the roadway express agreement in overstated the potential financial impact to bandag on the termination of the agreement since it did not take into account or reflect the contribution to earnings which bandag recognized upon the investment of the proceeds derived from the sale of the tires and wheels to yellow roadway corporation 
sale of south africa operations on december   the company sold the business of bandag in south africa with a portion of the purchase price consisting of installment payments to be made over five years 
in relation to the installment payments  bandag is considered the primary beneficiary under fasb interpretation no 
 revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities and therefore bandag deferred recognition of the expected net loss 
effective december   bandag is no longer considered the primary beneficiary and due to the foreign operations reporting on a one month lag  bandag will record the net loss of approximately  or diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of the loss is primarily due to the cumulative translation adjustment of approximately  that is recorded in the bandag consolidated balance sheet related to the south african operation 
the loss will not affect bandag s cash flow  but rather will be an accounting entry which will reduce net earnings 
results of operations results include the company s three reportable operating segments its traditional business  tds and speedco 
net sales consolidated net sales in increased  or  from this included an increase of  of net sales for speedco and an increase of  due to the effect of translating foreign currency denominated net sales into us dollars 
net sales in the traditional business were also positively impacted by price increases 
these increases in consolidated net sales were offset by a  decrease in tds net sales primarily as a result of the divestitures in retread unit volume in the traditional business was even with the prior year 
the company s sales pattern is tied to the overall performance of the economy and to the level of trucking activity

corporate expenses were negatively impacted by increased professional fees and personnel related costs and the higher translated value of the euro  brazilian real and south african rand 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  it has generally been the company s practice to adjust its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect changes in production and raw material costs in order to maintain its gross profit margin 
to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices the company increased selling prices in the united states and canada effective december   may  and november   and increased selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
the company may continue to increase prices if raw material costs rise further  however  due to competitive pressure and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the agreements 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment 
this increased capital investment would result in higher depreciation charges affecting both inventories and cost of products sold 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources prior to june   the company classified auction rate securities as part of cash and cash equivalents 
the company has determined that such securities do not technically meet the generally accepted accounting principles definition of cash and cash equivalents and therefore  now classifies these securities as investments 
the december  balance of  has been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet to conform with this presentation 
certain other prior period amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform with this presentation 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to  at december  the sale of tire and wheel assets discussed under overview outsourcing agreement contributed  to cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the company had investments of  as compared to  at december  the company s ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities was to at december  with current assets exceeding current liabilities by  the company believes it has an adequate cash balance for future cash needs 
net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period of the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for is primarily due to a decrease in net earnings and increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the price increases 
the increase in inventory is primarily due to the increased raw material costs 
the company typically funds its capital expenditures from operating cash flows 
during  the company spent  for capital expenditures as compared to  in the company anticipates capital expenditures of  to  in the increase in capital expenditures in  and is primarily due to expenditures made and to be made by speedco for new facilities and expansion of existing facilities 
on february   the company acquired an majority interest in speedco  inc from its founders and equilon enterprises  llc  a royal dutch shell group company 
in total  bandag paid  for its interest and to assume and retire  of debt 
on june   speedco  inc acquired the assets of six licensed locations  which were owned and operated by pm express  inc speedco paid  for these assets 
during  the company sold tds locations for cash proceeds of the company invests excess funds over various terms  but only instruments with an original maturity date of over days are classified as investments for balance sheet purposes 
the company s maturities of investments exceeded purchases by  during  resulting in total investments of  as of december  as of december   the company had available uncommitted and committed lines of credit totaling  in the united states for working capital purposes 
also  the company s foreign subsidiaries had approximately  in credit and overdraft facilities available to them 
from time to time during  the company borrowed funds to supplement operational cash flow needs or to settle intercompany transactions 
the company s long term liabilities totaled  at december   which is approximately of the combined total of long term liabilities and shareholders equity  and is a decrease of  from december  during the year  the company paid  on short term notes payable and long term obligations compared to  in cash dividends totaled  in compared to  in cash dividends per share declared were in compared to in during the year  the company purchased  shares of common stock and class a common stock at an average purchase price of per share  as compared to the purchase of  shares of common stock and class a common stock at an average price of for off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments following is a summary of the company s commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total after long term debt    interest on long term debt  operating leases      raw material purchase commitments    pension     post retirement medical liability  dmr commitments     other obligations      total contractual obligations    total amounts amount of commitments expiration per period other commercial commitments committed after standby letters of credit   future pension contributions are expected to approximate estimates of post retirement medical contributions are expected to approximate estimates of the company has entered into various agreements with certain customers and is obligated to reimburse those customers an amount based on an increase in sales volume 
the actual payments will range from to the total obligated amounts 
standby letters of credit are provided to the company s insurance administrators to cover costs associated with self insurance liabilities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions 
all derivative transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
analytical techniques and selective derivative instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso and european union euro 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency risks associated with most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to manage the foreign currency risks associated with approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions within the coming twelve months 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have been  in and  in the company also has foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of the company s net equity investment in its foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed as a result of its investment in foreign subsidiaries are the european euro  brazilian real  mexican peso  canadian dollar and south african rand 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels would have impacted the company s net foreign investments by  and  at december  and  respectively 
interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december  and  the company had outstanding debt of  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the fair value of securities held for investment was  and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
securities held for investment primarily consist of obligations of states and political subdivisions of a short term nature 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber  which is the predominant raw material used in manufacturing tire tread  at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
historically  the company increases its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect significant changes in commodity costs  however  due to competitive pressures and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices  the company increased selling prices in the united states and canada effective december   may  and november  and increased selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
therefore  the company s exposure is limited to the extent selling price increases fail to offset increases in commodity costs 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the related agreements 
critical accounting policies bandag s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management s discussion and analysis disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable bandag s global credit policies are corporately determined and managed through business unit credit and financial management departments to insure compliance with local laws and to effect proper credit and collections at the country level 
a significant percentage of the company s global accounts receivable are obligations of franchisees 
the majority of these accounts receivable are extended within north america 
however  bandag competes in the global marketplace and credit is also extended outside of the united states 
bandag continuously monitors political  social and economic risks to insure sound credit decisions are made within these foreign markets 
bandag also extends credit in north america to customers in the trucking and transportation industry 
credit is extended to large national and regional customers on a contractual basis through bandag 
smaller regional and local trucking customers are provided credit through tds and speedco 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
general reserves for bad debts are maintained based upon the length of time the receivables are past due and upon historical write off experience by geographic location 
credit losses have been within management s expectations 
goodwill and trade name asset valuation while goodwill is not amortized  it is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
the company utilizes discounted cash flow methods to review the carrying value of goodwill and trade name assets for impairment periodically at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the reporting unit s goodwill and trade name assets fair value and result in an impairment charge 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and trade name assets that totaled  at december   however  the current fair values of the company s reporting unit s goodwill and trade name assets are in excess of carrying values 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  this balance consists of approximately  of net deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing of income and deductions for tax versus books  and  of net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are provided under the assumption that all profits of the foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated to the united states and all foreign taxes paid will be available to offset united states taxes 
in addition  any deferred tax asset is reviewed annually to determine the probability of realizing the asset 
if it is determined unlikely that the asset will be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance is established against the asset 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further details 
the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various federal  state and foreign tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may not agree with the company s position on certain issues  that the cost of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various issues might be significant  and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such positions  the company maintains tax reserves 
these reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover  as well as their adequacy to do so  are reviewed both internally and with outside tax professionals on a regular and frequent basis 
periodic adjustments are made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or commencement of new examinations  and changes in tax law or interpretations of tax law 
the company has completed a preliminary analysis of the repatriation provisions provided by the american jobs creation act the act that was signed into law on october  the act created a special one time tax deduction relating to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings during either or it was determined that the act provided no benefit to the company for any foreign earnings repatriated during the years ended december  and  and therefore no amounts have been recognized in the financial statements under the repatriation provision 
marketing programs distribution management request dmr is a marketing program designed to increase company market share by enhancing dealer capability and franchise value 
enhanced dealer capabilities and franchise values are achieved primarily through company provided financial assistance towards the acquisition of equipment  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
under the dmr program  the company provides financial assistance primarily in the form of dmr promissory notes from the dealer to bandag
