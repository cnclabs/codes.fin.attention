item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial protective clothing market 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over safety and mill supply distributors 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments such as fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the department of defense  central intelligence agency  federal bureau of investigation  and the centers for disease control 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sales of limited use disposable protective clothing grew approximately in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january   and our expectation is to see continued growth 
we expect that distributors will continue to stock more inventory as economic conditions in the united states continue to improve 
we also expect our net sales to increase as we introduce our tyvek r based products into new industries in which the use of tyvek r is not widespread 
in addition  our net sales are driven in part by government funding and health related events 
our net sales attributable to chemical suits decreased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  these sales decreases were due primarily to a lull in government spending utilizing fire act monies and delays by state and local governmental purchasers in spending their bio terrorism monies 
these governmental sales are driven primarily by grants from the federal government under the fire act of and the bio terrorism preparedness and response act of as part of the homeland security initiatives 
during fiscal  as a result of the sars virus outbreak in various cities in  we sold approximately million of sars related garments in china  toronto  hong kong and taiwan 
the centers for disease control has recommended protective garments be used to protect healthcare workers in the fight against the spread of the sars virus and the avian flu 
in the event of future outbreaks of sars or other similar contagious viruses  such as avian flu in  we have positioned ourselves with increased production capacity 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since and in china since beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we are in the middle of the process of moving production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and expect to complete this process by the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to see profit margin improvements for these product lines as well 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards  and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our distributors at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are assessed for impairment annually and upon occurrence of an event that indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by sfas no 
factors that we consider important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires our management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
in fiscal  as a result of our decision to move a portion of our reusable woven garment assembly from the united states to china  we reviewed this portion of our business for impairment 
an impairment was calculated based on estimating the fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
we had no remaining goodwill recorded as of january  in august we purchased mifflin valley  a manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
this purchase resulted in the recording of  in goodwill as of january  self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table set forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense  net minority interest in net income of variable interest entities income tax expense net income significant balance sheet fluctuation january  as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the increase in borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is principally due to the increase in inventories as we build our finished goods inventory for our seasonally strong fourth and first quarters for fiscal and we also built raw material reserves due to an anticipated increase in the cost of these raw materials 
accounts receivable increased due to increased january sales 
plant property and equipment increased as a result of purchasing million of facilities in alabama in april and may that had been subject to fin r  in which we recorded million of buildings in our consolidation of variable interest entities in the previous fiscal year 
a corporate headquarters was also purchased in new york for  in may year ended january  compared to the year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the january  year ended from million for the year ending january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the sales in our core non woven disposable products line and secondarily by our fire and glove lines respectively 
increased sales were also driven by an improving us and canadian economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial non woven disposable markets we serve  the acquisition of mifflin valley  inc in july  offset by decreased demand for our chemical protective suits for homeland security purposes which decreased month over month from february to october but then started increasing from november to our fiscal year ended january  gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek r based products and chemical suits to china and mexico and changes in product mix 
we have increasingly shifted and will continue to shift production to these lower cost facilities in order to increase our margins 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to an increase in o salaries of million o freight of million o sales commissions of 
million o pension expense 
million o sales related expenses of 
million o payroll taxes of million o currency fluctuations of million o professional fees of million o consulting fees of million pertaining to sarbanes oxley compliance o other million o the absence in the current year of a minority interest reclassification in the prior year of million  leaving a net increase of million 
operating profit 
operating profit increased by million  or  to million for the year ended  from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ending january  primarily due to the higher margins as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by 
million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because of decreased borrowings and interest rates 
minority interest 
minority interest in net income of variable interest entities decreased by 
million for the year ended january  as a result of our adoption on financial interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective february  and then our purchasing such properties in fiscal year subsequent to our adoption of fin r  we determined that certain entities from which we lease real property and which are partially owned by related parties are variable interest entities governed by fin r 
as a result  these entities were consolidated in our statement of income for the year ended january  these facilities were purchased in april and may thereby negating the recording of variable interest entities in fiscal other income net 
other income net increased million principally as a result of the settlement by the company as plaintiff for million of an outstanding litigation involving two former employees of the company 
income tax expense 
income tax expenses consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the repatriation of million in profits from our chinese subsidiaries and a reserve of  covering the portion of the claims of the irs which can be determined due to a recent audit 
the resolution of the remainder of their claims cannot be determined at this time 
net income 
net income increased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales and productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher sales and increases in our tax rates as mentioned above 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the january  year ended from million for the year ending january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the sales of our chemical suits and also an increase in our core non woven disposable products line 
increased sales were also driven by an improving us economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial non woven disposable markets we serve  and increased demand for our chemical protective suits and fire turnout gear for homeland security purposes 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek r based products and chemical suits to china and mexico and changes in the mix resulting from more sales of the higher margin chemical suits 
we have increasingly shifted and will continue to shift production to these lower cost facilities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to an increase in o salaries of million o freight of million o sales commissions of million o sales related expenses of million o insurance expense of

operating income as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ending january  primarily due to increased margins as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by 
million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because we paid off our credit facility in full on june   from the proceeds of our secondary stock offering 
minority interest 
minority interest in net income of variable interest entities increased to 
million for the year ended january  as a result of our adoption on financial interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective february  subsequent to our adoption of fin r  we determined that certain entities from which we lease real property and which are partially owned by related parties are variable interest entities governed by fin r 
as a result  these entities have been consolidated in our statement of income for the year ended january  income tax expense 
income tax expenses consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased 
million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the year ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates  inclusion of minority interest in net income of variable interest entities and utilization of a tax carry forward 
net income 
net income increased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales primarily in the chemical suits and increased productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher sales 
liquidity and capital resources management measures our liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operational funding needs and fund additional investments  including acquisitions 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital under satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation  together with currently available cash and investment and an ability to access credit lines if needed  are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and any increase in working capital that we would need to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we are actively seeking to expand by acquisitions as well as through organic growth of our business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional borrowings  equity financing or both  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms based  among other things  on our earnings performance and current financial position 
cash flows as of january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  a decrease and increase of million and million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million  offset by an increase in inventories of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of 
million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in minority interest liability of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of mifflin valley 
net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facilities and to the secondary offering in fiscal credit facilities we currently have one credit facility o a five year  million revolving credit facility  of which we had borrowings outstanding as of january  amounting to million our million revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lower of million and a borrowing base determined by reference to a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
our million revolving credit facility expires on july  borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  as of january   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
our credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment  leasehold improvement and automobiles  as well as payments related to the construction of our facilities in china 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and thus chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to purchase our capital equipment primarily computer equipment and apparel manufacturing equipment in fiscal contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period less than total year years years after years in thousands operating leases     revolving credit facility   total     seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities  and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to cooler temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months  and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between september and march coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for our first annual reporting period that begins after june  if the company had included the cost of employee stock option compensation in our financial statements it would not have had a material effect on our net income for the years ended january    and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which has been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has recently been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government  and therefore  we will be exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in canada and  to a smaller extent  in europe 
our sales to customers in canada are denominated in canadian dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to our canadian customers because of the exchange rate change 
our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  however  our sales there are presently not material 
at this time  we do not manage the foreign currency risk through the use of derivative instruments 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the landed costs into the us but would make our selling price for international sales more attractive with respect to foreign currencies 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased and our income before income taxes would have decreased by less than
