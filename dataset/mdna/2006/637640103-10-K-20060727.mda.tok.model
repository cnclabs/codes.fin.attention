item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this md a and annual report on form k contain a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in part i of form k item a risks factors and business outlook section of this md a 
these statements relate to  among other things  sales  gross margins  operating expenses  capital expenditures  r d efforts and asset dispositions and are indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate  expect  outlook  foresee  believe  could  intend  will  and similar words or phrases 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
these forward looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of future events as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur 
for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements  see the discussion on risk factors that appears in item a of our form k and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof and disclaim any obligation to do so 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
o strategy and business our strategy is to be the premier analog company creating high value analog devices and subsystems 
we focus on our analog product capabilities  particularly in the standard linear categories 
our leading edge products include power management circuits  display drivers  audio and operational amplifiers  communication interface products and data conversion solutions 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from analog based products 
for more information on our business  see part i  item i  business  in our form k 
o critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement typically in the form of a purchase order  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales were made to distributors in fiscal we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume  price protection for inventory  scrap allowances and discounts for prompt payment 
the prompt payment program was discontinued during fiscal for substantially all of our distributors  except in the japanese region 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates  and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
these revenues are included in net sales and are not a material component of our total net sales 
certain intellectual property income is classified as revenue if it meets specified criteria established by company policy that defines whether it is considered a source of income from our primary operations 
these revenues are included in net sales and totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal there were no intellectual property amounts classified as sales in fiscal all other intellectual property income that does not meet the specified criteria is not considered a source of income from primary operations and is therefore classified as a component of other operating income  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
intellectual property income is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and remaining obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory to the other party 
b valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the total carrying value of our inventory is net of any reductions we have recorded to reflect the difference between cost and estimated market value of inventory that is determined to be obsolete or unmarketable based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
reductions in carrying value are deemed to establish a new cost basis 
therefore  inventory is not written up if estimates of market value subsequently improve 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reasonable estimates 
the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include o significant decrease in the market value of an asset o significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition o significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset o significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions o current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units with goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
as of may  our reporting units with goodwill include our flat panel displays formerly within displays  rf products formerly within wireless  portable power formerly within power management  non audio amplifier and interface business units  which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment  and our device connectivity business unit  which is included in all others 
our estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions for these business units fail to materialize as anticipated  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our net equity and results of operations 
d income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the valuation allowance has been established primarily against the reinvestment and investment tax allowances related to malaysia because we have concluded that a significant portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized owing to the uncertainty of sufficient taxable income in malaysia beyond the foreseeable future 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based on historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we currently have recorded  such adjustment could have a material impact on the tax expense for the fiscal year 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
o overview throughout fiscal  we continued to focus on addressing analog product areas  particularly in the analog standard linear categories 
the world semiconductor trade statistics wsts define standard linear as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management products  and interface 
as a part of our business focus  we periodically identify opportunities to improve our cost structure or to divest or reduce involvement in product areas that are not in line with our business objectives 
in june  we completed the sale of our cordless business unit in europe to hgcapital 
in july  we announced a planned closure of our assembly and test plant in singapore in a phased shutdown with the plant s volume to be consolidated into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the closure activities occurred throughout fiscal and are targeted to be completed by the end of our first quarter of fiscal in november  we took steps to reduce indirect manufacturing costs at our texas plant 
this included a change in the plant s organizational structure and a reduction of its workforce 
our sales and gross margin percentage in fiscal were both higher than they were in the preceding fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin reflects growth in our higher margin analog products  as well as higher factory utilization associated with increased volume 
we continued our focus on improving our gross margin relative to sales with our research and development investments aimed primarily at high value growth areas in analog standard linear markets 
in reviewing our performance we consider several key financial measures 
when reviewing our net sales performance  we look at sales growth rates  new order rates including turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter  blended average selling prices  sales of new products and market share in the analog standard linear category as defined by wsts 
we generally define new products as those introduced within the last three years 
we gauge our operating income performance based on gross margin trends  product mix  blended average selling prices  factory utilization rates and operating expenses relative to sales 
we are focused on generating a consistently high return on invested capital by concentrating on operating income  working capital management  capital expenditures and cash management 
we determine return on invested capital based on net operating income after tax divided by invested capital  which generally consists of total assets reduced by goodwill and non interest bearing liabilities 
we continued our stock repurchase activity in fiscal under three programs i the million stock repurchase program announced in march of which we used million to repurchase million shares of common stock in fiscal  ii the million stock repurchase program announced in september  and iii the million stock repurchase program announced in december under these programs we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal all of these shares were purchased in the open market 
the stock repurchase activity is one element of our overall program to deliver a consistently high return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value over time 
as of may   we had million remaining for future common stock repurchases under the program announced in december on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved an additional million stock repurchase program similar to our prior stock repurchase programs 
we also continued our dividend program in fiscal  as we paid a total of million in cash dividends during the fiscal year 
in june  the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  the following table and discussion provide an overview of our operating results for fiscal years  and years ended may  may  may  in millions change change net sales    operating income as a of net sales net income as a of net sales net income for fiscal includes a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from cost reduction actions taken during the year see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill impairment losses of million  gain from sale of businesses of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  net intellectual property income of million  an impairment loss on an intangible asset other than goodwill of million and other operating income of million 
all of these charges and credits are pre tax amounts 
fiscal net income also includes million of tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under provisions of the american jobs creation act of net income for fiscal included a goodwill impairment loss of million  a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expense related to cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements  gain from the sale of businesses of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  a net credit of million related to litigation settlements  a refund of million from the california manufacturer s investment credit  net intellectual property income of million and other operating expenses of million 
all of these charges and credits are pre tax amounts 
fiscal net income also reflected a net tax benefit of million  which consisted of income tax expense of million offset by a benefit from the change in the beginning of the year valuation allowance of million 
net income for fiscal included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses related to cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements  a litigation charge of million  net intellectual property income of million and settlement of certain patent infringement claims for million 
all of these charges and credits are pre tax amounts 
fiscal net income also included a million charge including a tax effect of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o net sales years ended may  may  may  in millions change change analog segment    as a of net sales all others as a of net sales total net sales    the chart above and the following discussion are based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the analog segment represented percent of our total sales compared to percent in fiscal the shift in percentage was due solely to our disposition of the cordless business which had been a business unit included within our analog segment in fiscal and in fiscal  we provided foundry materials to the new owners of this business and those sales are included in the all others category 
analog segment sales growth in fiscal was driven by stronger customer demand levels  especially in wireless handset and portable consumer markets 
we also increased our market share in the analog standard linear area during fiscal analog unit shipments were up percent in fiscal over fiscal while blended average selling prices for the whole company were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  blended average selling prices in our analog standard linear product portfolio were up by percent 
although our analog products generally have lower blended average selling prices than our non analog products  they also have higher margins 
within the analog segment  products sold by the power management  data conversion  amplifier including audio amplifier products and interface business units were the underlying drivers of the growth in sales for fiscal with increases of percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
for the all others category  the increase in sales for fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to the foundry sales related to the cordless business that was divested in june there were no such foundry sales related to the cordless business in fiscal for fiscal  sales increased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the increases were percent in the asia pacific region  percent in both the americas and japan  and percent in europe 
sales in fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent in the asia pacific region  while remaining flat at percent in the americas and percent in japan  and decreasing to percent in europe 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the pound sterling  euro and japanese yen all weakened over the fiscal year against the dollar 
however  the impact was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales were denominated in a foreign currency 
analog segment sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal because efforts by distributors and customers to reduce inventories combined with lower than expected demand patterns as we exited our summer quarter caused sales in the second half of fiscal to decline significantly compared to sales in the second half of fiscal our analog unit shipments were down percent in fiscal from fiscal  but blended average analog selling prices were up by percent in fiscal over fiscal  reflecting both a mix of higher value products as well as some actual price increases 
within the analog segment  sales from the power management area grew percent in fiscal over fiscal this was driven mainly by increased activity in wireless handsets 
sales from both the audio amplifier and data conversion business units increased by percent in fiscal over fiscal however  sales from the application specific wireless including radio frequency building blocks and non audio amplifier business units declined in fiscal by percent and percent  respectively  from fiscal the decrease in radio frequency chip sales was due to a trend in cellular handsets in which the radio function migrated from discrete building block solutions to more highly integrated chips 
phones that utilize integrated radios typically do not need discrete pll building block chips  such as those sold by us 
for fiscal  sales decreased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the decreases were percent in the americas and percent in the asia pacific region while both europe and japan each decreased percent 
sales in fiscal as a percentage of total sales remained flat at percent in europe and percent in japan  while the asia pacific region increased to percent and the americas decreased to percent 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar 
however  the impact was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales was denominated in a foreign currency 
o gross margin years ended may  may  may  in millions change change net sales    cost of sales gross margin    as a of net sales the increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by improved product mix of higher margin analog standard linear products 
our product mix improved through our active efforts to increase the portion of our business that comes from high value  higher performance analog products  which are more proprietary in nature and can generate higher margins than products that are less proprietary or are multi sourced 
higher factory utilization  coupled with manufacturing efficiencies  also contributed to the gross margin improvement during fiscal wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly driven by improvements in product mix and blended average selling prices 
our wafer fabrication capacity utilization was actually down year over year at percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal because of this lower utilization  we implemented mandatory factory shutdowns and initiated an action in january to eliminate manufacturing personnel positions 
since our analog products generally have higher margins than non analog products  the growth in analog segment sales to percent of total net sales in fiscal from percent of total net sales in fiscal had a positive impact on gross margin  despite the lower factory utilization 
o research and development years ended may  may  may  in millions change change research and development as a of net sales lower research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal largely reflect cost savings from the businesses we divested 
at the same time  we are continuing to concentrate our ongoing research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities 
although research and development spending is down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending on our key focus areas in the analog segment increased approximately percent as we continue to invest in the development of new analog products for wireless handsets  displays  other portable devices  as well as applications for the broader markets requiring analog technology 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
lower research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected a full year of cost savings from our sale and exit of the information appliance business in august and the completion in fiscal of other actions aimed at reducing our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales 
r d expenses for fiscal also reflected reductions due to the sale of the imaging and pc super i o businesses that occurred during the fiscal year 
total company spending in fiscal compared to fiscal was down percent for new product development and percent for process and support technology 
although research and development spending for the year was down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending on our key focus areas in the analog segment increased approximately percent 
o selling  general and administrative years ended may  may  may  in millions change change selling  general and administrative as a of net sales the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to higher personnel costs in fiscal  mainly attributable to increased compensation and benefits 
as a percentage of sales  however  our sg a expenses were actually down slightly as we continue to manage our cost structure in line with our overall business model objectives 
the reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal reflected our specific efforts to manage our cost structure more efficiently 
in addition  we implemented discretionary cost control programs during fiscal in response to the industry wide sales declines we saw in the early part of the fiscal year that resulted from excess inventories in the supply chain 
although to a much lesser extent than r d expenses  sg a expenses for fiscal also reflected some reductions due to the sale of the imaging and pc super i o businesses that occurred during the fiscal year 
the sg a expenses in fiscal were down from fiscal not only in actual dollars  but also as a percent of sales 
o severance and restructuring expenses related to cost reduction programs our fiscal results include a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from cost reduction actions taken during the year 
these actions include the phased closure of our assembly and test plant in singapore  steps to reduce indirect manufacturing costs at our texas plant and additional cost reduction actions primarily related to the reorganization of our product lines into two groups analog signal path group and power management group originally announced at the end of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  as well as a discussion of fiscal activity related to previously announced actions 
our fiscal results included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses related to several actions taken during fiscal these actions included workforce reductions connected with the divestiture of the imaging business  the streamlining of manufacturing to address the lower utilization of manufacturing facilities experienced during the fiscal year and the reorganization of our product lines into two groups effective at the beginning of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
during fiscal  we substantially completed all cost reduction actions related to our strategic profit improvement actions initially launched in february these actions included the exit and sale of the information appliance business  and other actions aimed at improving profitability and return on invested capital 
the net charge in fiscal for severance and restructuring expenses was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
o gain from sale of businesses as part of our actions to reposition toward a higher value portfolio  we have divested businesses that do not align with our business model 
our fiscal results include a gain of million upon the completion in april of the sale of a small business unit that was developing high definition products hdp and a gain of million from the sale completed in june of our cordless business unit 
in connection with the sale of the cordless business unit  we also recorded an additional gain of million  which represented contingent consideration earned when the buyer achieved certain revenue milestones set forth in the agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these transactions 
our fiscal results included a gain of million upon completion of the sale of certain intellectual property  inventory and equipment of our imaging business in september and a gain of million upon close of the sale in may of our pc super i o business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these transactions 
o goodwill impairment loss our fiscal results include a million impairment loss for goodwill in our hdp reporting unit  which arose in connection with our decision to sell that business 
we also recorded an additional million impairment loss for goodwill in our crt reporting unit  which arose in connection with our annual evaluation of goodwill in our fiscal fourth quarter 
the fair values of the hdp and crt reporting units were determined using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated our estimates of future sales and costs for the business units 
our fiscal results include an million impairment loss for goodwill in our wireless reporting unit  which arose in connection with our annual evaluation of goodwill 
the fair value of the wireless reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated our estimates of future sales and costs for the business unit 
o interest income and interest expense years ended may  may  may  in millions interest income interest expense interest income  net the increase in interest income  net  for fiscal over fiscal and for fiscal over fiscal was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates in each year 
interest expense in fiscal and fiscal also includes the accretion of interest associated with software license obligations 
o other non operating expense  net years ended may  may  may  in millions gain on investments share in net losses of equity method investments charitable contribution other total other non operating expense  net the components of other non operating expense  net include activities related to our investments 
the gain on investments in fiscal reflects the sale of shares in available for sale securities and a non publicly traded company  as well as the change in unrealized holdings gains from trading securities  offset by an impairment loss on a non marketable investment 
the share of net losses in equity method investments has declined in both fiscal and because we carried lower balances for these types of investments 
the gain on investments in fiscal relates to the sale of shares in a non publicly traded company 
net gain on investments for fiscal was primarily from the sale of shares in two non publicly traded companies upon their acquisitions by third parties 
other non operating expenses included a litigation settlement in fiscal and the write down to net realizable value of a note receivable 
o income tax expense years ended may  may  may  in millions income tax expense effective tax rate we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal this compares to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and income tax expense of million in fiscal in addition to having higher income before tax in fiscal than we had in fiscal  resulting in higher taxes  the fiscal income tax expense includes an additional million of tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under provisions of the american jobs creation act of while income before income tax was higher in fiscal than it was in fiscal  we received an income tax benefit primarily because of the recognition of additional tax benefits that had not been previously recognized 
the fiscal income tax benefit included tax expense of million  which consisted of both us and us income taxes  offset by a benefit from the change in the beginning of the year valuation allowance of million 
fiscal tax expense consisted primarily of us income tax  net of benefits related to prior period net operating losses and tax credits  and non us income taxes 
our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax assets 
because our ability to utilize these tax assets is dependent on future results  it is possible that we will be unable to ultimately realize some portion or all of the benefits of recognized tax assets 
this could result in additions to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an increase to tax expense 
o foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities during fiscal was concentrated in uk pound sterling  singapore dollar  malaysian ringgit and chinese rmb 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen  pound sterling and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is at times hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
at some of our international locations  we maintain defined benefit pension plans that operate in accordance with local statutes and practices 
as required by the pension accounting standards  we record an adjustment for minimum pension liability to adjust the liability related to one of these plans to equal the amount of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
for fiscal  the adjustment was million and a corresponding amount  net of a million tax effect  is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio  a series of severe cuts in interest rates does have a significant impact on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio 
an increase in interest rates benefits us due to our large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates would not necessarily immediately increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of our existing debt obligations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  pound sterling  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of these potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of may  o liquidity and capital resources years ended may  may  may  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by by financing activities the primary factors contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  and are described below the improvement in net income has been the primary contributor to the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal years and in fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated primarily from net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization and the tax benefit associated with stock options combined with a positive impact that came from changes in working capital components 
we also generated cash from operating activities in fiscal years and when the positive impact from net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  was greater than the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
the major use of cash for investing activities during fiscal was for investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  which was partially offset by the proceeds of million from the sale of our cordless and high definition products businesses  million from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities and million from the sales of investments 
major uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  purchases of available for sale securities of million  and payments for security deposits on leased equipment of million 
these were partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of assets associated with the imaging and pc super i o businesses 
major uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and payments for security deposits on leased equipment of million 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
all of these shares were repurchased in the open market 
we also used cash to pay million in cash dividends and million on software license obligations 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
of these shares  million shares were repurchased in the open market for million and the remaining million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated transactions with a major financial institution 
we also used cash in fiscal to make payments of million on software license obligations and million for cash dividends 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal came from our repurchase of a total of million shares of our common stock for million  net advances of million to acquire our common stock and payments of million on software license obligations 
a portion million shares of the stock repurchase was transacted directly with a major financial institution and the remainder in the open market 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock to be paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  at the same time  we also announced that our board of directors approved a new million stock repurchase program similar to the previous programs approved in fiscal and the stock repurchase program is consistent with our current business model which focuses on higher value analog products and  therefore  is less capital intensive than it has been historically 
as of may   we had million remaining for future common stock repurchases under the program announced in december we also made a million contribution to one of our international defined benefit pension plans in march and we plan to continue to fund the plan in the future to adequately meet the minimum funding requirements under local statutes 
we foresee continuing cash outlays for plant and equipment in fiscal  with our primary focus on analog capabilities at our existing sites 
as a result  our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be similar to the fiscal amount 
however  we will continue to manage the level of capital expenditures relative to sales levels  capacity utilization and industry business conditions 
we expect that existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit and cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to finance the capital investments currently planned for fiscal  as well as the declared dividend  the stock repurchase program and the pension contribution 
our cash and investment balances are dependent in part on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  significant declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables 
in addition  major declines in financial markets would most likely cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments

we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we do not believe we are materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
o recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement is the result of a broader effort by the fasb working with the international accounting standards board to reduce differences between us and international accounting standards 
sfas no 
eliminates the so abnormal criterion in arb no 
and companies will no longer be permitted to capitalize inventory costs on their balance sheets when the production defect rate varies significantly from the expected rate 
it also makes clear that fixed overhead should be allocated based on normal capacity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of this statement effective at the beginning of our fiscal first quarter to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we expect the adoption of this statement effective at the beginning of our fiscal first quarter will materially increase expenses included in our reported results of operations for fiscal and thereafter 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles 
pursuant to the new rules  all such changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
this statement replaces apb no 
and sfas no 
 although it carries forward the guidance in those pronouncements with respect to accounting for changes in estimates  changes in the reporting entity and the correction of errors 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of this statement effective at the beginning of our fiscal first quarter to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement is aimed at improving the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for these instruments 
we are currently analyzing this statement and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on emerging issues task force issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf applies to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but are not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
the board concluded that the presentation of taxes within the scope of the eitf on either a gross or a net basis is an accounting policy decision to be disclosed pursuant to abp opinion no 
the requirements of this eitf will apply to our fiscal annual financial report 
we do not expect the eitf to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements since it only requires the presentation of additional disclosures 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal we are currently analyzing the requirements of this interpretation and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
o outlook compared to fiscal  we experienced stronger market conditions throughout fiscal new orders in the fourth quarter were slightly higher than the third quarter of fiscal  driven by a combination of seasonally higher orders for products that serve wireless handsets and other portable electronics  as well as increased orders from our distributors  which tend to serve the broader markets 
distribution resale activity in all regions was up in our fiscal fourth quarter compared to the preceding third quarter while distributor weeks of inventory declined in all regions except europe with the largest reduction in the asia pacific region 
our opening week backlog entering the first quarter of fiscal was below what it was when we began the fourth quarter of fiscal  but this is not unusual as we head into the summer 
historically  we have seen order patterns during our first quarter to be generally lower than in the preceding fourth quarter because manufacturing activity at some of our customers is typically lower over the summer season  particularly in the european region 
we also expect the foundry sales for our divested businesses to decline sequentially in the first quarter by more than million 
considering all factors  including those discussed above and our historical seasonality patterns  we provided guidance for net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be down to percent sequentially from the level achieved in our recently completed fiscal fourth quarter 
however  if backlog orders are cancelled or if the currently anticipated level of turns orders is less than expected  we may not be able to achieve this level of sales 
we expect our gross margin percentage to be similar to the percentage achieved in the fiscal fourth quarter based on the expected sales level and including the estimated impact of compensation expense from the adoption of sfas no 
r discussed below 
we expect wafer fabrication capacity utilization to continue to run at levels similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter 
however  if there is a decline in factory utilization or changes in the expected sales level or product mix  our gross margin percentage could be negatively impacted 
in july  we announced a plan to close our assembly and test facility in singapore and consolidate its equipment and ongoing production volume into our assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the closure activities occurred throughout fiscal and are targeted to be completed in our first quarter of fiscal although we expect some future reduction in our manufacturing costs once the closure is completed  manufacturing costs during the interim may be unfavorably affected by the discrete costs of the transfer activity 
commencing in our first quarter of fiscal  we will begin to record compensation expense related to stock based plans upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
until now  we have accounted for stock based awards such as stock option and employee stock purchase plans using the intrinsic method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  we generally have not recognized any compensation expense for these awards in our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will materially increase our operating expenses due to the amortization of the fair value of the outstanding unvested share based awards over their vesting period 
the financial impact in future periods will depend on the level of share based awards granted in the future 
we currently estimate that the fiscal first quarter compensation expense related to share based awards will range from to million on a pre tax basis
