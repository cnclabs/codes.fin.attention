item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its reserves by both specific identification of customer accounts where appropriate and the application of historical loss experience to non specific accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

index to financial statements inventory the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the company s operations include miscalculating customer requirements  technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders  stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the aforementioned assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when inventory is written off  it is never written back up  the cost remains at zero or the level to which it has been written down 
when inventory that has been written off is subsequently used in the manufacturing process  the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales 
should any of this inventory be used in the manufacturing process for customer orders  the improved gross profit will be recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded 
acquisitions acquisitions continue to be a key element in the company s growth strategy 
if the company s evaluation of a merger candidate misjudges its technology  estimated future sales and profitability levels  or ability to keep pace with the latest technology  these factors could impair the value of the investment  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations

historically the company has been successful in mitigating the risks associated with its revenue recognition 
some issues relate to product warranty  credit worthiness of its customers and concentration of sales among a few major customers 
the company is not contractually obligated to accept returns from non distributor customers except for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the company s quality specifications 
if these conditions existed  the company would be obligated to repair or replace the defective product or make a cash settlement with the customer 
distributors generally have the right to return up to of their purchases over the previous three to six months and are obligated to purchase an amount at least equal to the return 
if the company terminates a distributor  the company is obligated to accept as a return all of the distributor s inventory from the company 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for bad debt may be required which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the company has a significant amount of sales with several major customers 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position

the company cannot quantify the extent of sales growth arising from unit sales mix and or price changes 
given the change in the nature of the products purchased by customers from period to period  the company believes that neither unit changes nor price changes are meaningful 
over the past year  newer and more sophisticated products with higher unit selling prices have been introduced 
through the company s engineering and research effort  the company has been successful in adding additional value to existing product lines  which tends to increase sales prices initially until that generation of products becomes mature and sales prices experience price degradation 
in general  as products become mature  average selling prices decrease

more specifically  the company has the majority of its products manufactured in the people s republic of china prc  hong kong and macao and has not been subject to corporate income tax in the prc 
the company s activities in hong kong have generally consisted of administration  quality control and accounting  as well as some limited manufacturing activities 
hong kong imposes corporate income tax at a rate of percent solely on income sourced to hong kong 
that is  its tax system is a territorial one which only seeks to tax activities conducted in hong kong 
since the bel entity in hong kong conducts most of its manufacturing and quality control activities in the prc  a portion of this entity s income is deemed offshore and thus not fully taxable in hong kong 
although the statutory tax rate in hong kong is percent  the company generally pays an effective hong kong rate of less than percent 
the company also conducts manufacturing operations in macao 
macao has a statutory corporate income tax rate of percent 
however  the company  as a result of investing in a certain location in macao  was able to obtain a year tax holiday in macao  thereby reducing its effective macao income tax rate from percent to percent 
the tax holiday in macao expired in april since most of the company s operations are conducted in the far east  the majority of its profits are sourced in these three far east jurisdictions 
accordingly  the profits earned in the us are comparatively small in relation to its profits earned in the far east 
therefore  there is generally a significant difference between the statutory us tax rate and the company s effective tax rate

most significant expenses  including raw materials  labor and manufacturing expenses  are either incurred in us dollars or the currencies of the hong kong dollar  the macao pataca or the chinese renminbi
