item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the trustee s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  is incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources the trust s only cash requirement is the monthly distribution of its income to unitholders  which is funded by the monthly receipt of net profits income after payment of trust administration expenses 
the trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the underlying properties 
if at any time the trust receives net profits income in excess of the amount due  the trust is not obligated to return such overpayment  but future net profits income payable to the trust will be reduced by the overpayment  plus interest at the prime rate 
the trust does not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the trust s liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements the trust has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party  nor does the trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt  losses or contingent obligations 
contractual obligations as shown below  the trust had no obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december   other than the december distribution payable to unitholders in january  as reflected in the statement of assets  liabilities and trust corpus 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years distribution payable to unitholders related party transactions the underlying properties from which the net profits interests were carved are currently owned by xto energy  which operates approximately of the underlying properties 
in computing net proceeds  xto energy deducts a monthly overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses on the underlying properties it operates 
as of december   the monthly overhead charge  based on the number of operated wells  was approximately   net to the trust and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index 
as of december   xto energy owned  or  of the  outstanding units 
in january  the board of directors of xto energy declared a dividend of all of the million trust units it owns 
these units are to be distributed on may  to xto energy s common stockholders of record on april  after this dividend  xto energy will not be a unitholder of the trust 
also in january  xto energy announced that it will consider selling the underlying properties 
any sale is dependent upon xto energy s ability to structure a tax efficient transaction and receive sufficient consideration from a buyer it deems to be qualified 
xto energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of xto energy s wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created  generally at amounts approximating monthly published market prices 
for further information regarding natural gas sales from the underlying properties to affiliates of xto energy  see item  properties  and note to financial statements in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  total gas sales from the underlying properties to xto energy s wholly owned subsidiaries were million  or of total gas sales  for the year ended december   million  or of total gas sales  for the year ended december  and million  or of total gas sales  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are significantly affected by its basis of accounting and estimates related to its oil and gas properties and proved reserves  as summarized below 
basis of accounting the trust s financial statements are prepared on a modified cash basis  which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than us generally accepted accounting principles 
this method of accounting is consistent with reporting of taxable income to trust unitholders 
the most significant differences between the trust s financial statements and those prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles are net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production 
expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred 
cash reserves may be established by the trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles 
this comprehensive basis of accounting other than us generally accepted accounting principles corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the us securities and exchange commission  as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic e  financial statements of royalty trusts 
for further information regarding the trust s basis of accounting  see note to financial statements in the trust s annual report to unitholders for the year ended december  all amounts included in the trust s financial statements are based on cash amounts received or disbursed  or on the carrying value of the net profits interests  which was derived from the historical cost of the interests at the date of their transfer from xto energy  less accumulated amortization to date 
accordingly  there are no fair value estimates included in the financial statements based on either exchange or nonexchange trade values 
oil and gas reserves the proved oil and gas reserves for the underlying properties are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimated reserves for the underlying properties are then used by xto energy to calculate the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the net profits interests 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from original estimates 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in item  is prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions  including consideration of other factors  could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent xto energy s or the trustee s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed  or to be filed  by the trust with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by xto energy or the trustee contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to the trust  operations of the underlying properties and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may concern  among other things  development activities  increased density drilling  maintenance projects  development  production and other costs  oil and gas prices  pricing differentials  proved reserves  production levels  litigation  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on xto energy s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  anticipates  predicts  believes  goals  estimates  should  could  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates or assumptions expressed in  implied in  or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are explained in item a 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the only assets of and sources of income to the trust are the net profits interests  which generally entitle the trust to receive a share of the net profits from oil and gas production from the underlying properties 
consequently  the trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the trust is a passive entity and  other than the trust s ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses  liabilities and obligations of the trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the trust  the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions 
the amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the trust 
in addition  the trustee is prohibited by the trust indenture from engaging in any business activity or causing the trust to enter into any investments other than investing cash on hand in specific short term cash investments 
therefore  the trust cannot hold any derivative financial instruments 
as a result of the limited nature of the trust s borrowing and investing activities  the trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk 
additionally  any gains or losses from any hedging activities conducted by xto energy are specifically excluded from the calculation of net proceeds due the trust under the forms of the conveyances 
the trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the trust to any foreign currency related market risk
