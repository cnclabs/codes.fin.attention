item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business overview we research  develop  license and commercialize innovative physiological treatment protocols designed for use by healthcare providers to treat individuals diagnosed with dependencies to alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamine  as well as combinations of these drugs 
unlike traditional treatment methodologies  our proprietary prometa treatment protocols include medically supervised treatments designed to address both the neurochemical imbalances in the brain and some of the nutritional deficits caused or worsened by substance dependence 
changes in brain chemistry and function play an important role in the physical and behavioral symptoms of substance dependence  including tolerance  withdrawal symptoms  craving and relapse 
prometa represents an innovative approach to managing substance dependence that is designed to address physiological  nutritional and psychosocial aspects of the disease  and is thereby intended to offer patients an opportunity to achieve sustained recovery 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and may incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next twelve months as we incur expenditures on research and development  continue to implement commercial operations and allocate significant and increasing resources to sales  marketing and other activities 
accordingly  our activities to date are not as broad in depth or scope as the activities we may undertake in the future  and our historical operations and financial information are not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition or ability to operate profitably as a commercial enterprise 
traditional treatment approaches for substance dependence focus mainly on group therapy  abstinence  and behavioral modification  while the disease s underlying physiology and pathology is rarely addressed  resulting in fairly high relapse rates 
currently therapies are beginning to target brain receptors thought to play a central role in the disease process 
we believe that our prometa protocols offer an improvement to traditional treatments 
table of contents because treatments with prometa are designed to directly target the pathophysiology induced by chronic use of alcohol or other drugs 
without specific treatment  the abnormalities in brain function induced by chronic drug dependence may take months to years of drug abstinence to return to normal function 
we believe the prometa protocols offer an advantage to traditional alternatives because they provide a treatment methodology that is discreet  mildly sedating and that can be initiated in only two to three days  with a second two day treatment three weeks later for addictive stimulants 
our prometa protocols also provide for one month of prescription medication and nutritional supplements  combined with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy chosen by the patient in conjunction with their treatment provider 
initial clinical observations suggest that our protocols may improve cognitive function  reduce withdrawal symptoms  be associated with higher initial completion rates than conventional treatments  and reduce physical cravings which can be a major factor in relapse  thus allowing patients to more meaningfully engage in counseling or other forms of psychosocial therapy 
these conclusions were reached during treatment of approximately patients and may not be confirmed by clinical research studies  may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
we believe the short initial treatment period when using our prometa protocols is a major advantage over traditional inpatient treatments and residential treatment programs  which typically consist of approximately days of combined inpatient detoxification and recovery in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center 
treatment with prometa does not require an extensive stay at an inpatient facility 
rather  the protocols offer the convenience of a two to three day treatment addictive stimulants require a second two day treatment three weeks later and can generally be administered on an outpatient basis 
this is particularly relevant since approximately of adults classified with dependence or abuse are employed  and loss of time from work can be a major deterrent for seeking treatment 
moreover  we believe prometa can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other forms of alcohol and drug abuse treatments 
as such  our protocols offer a potentially valuable alternative or addition to traditional behavioral or pharmotherapy treatments that does not require chronic administration of a pharmacotherapy  thus minimizing compliance issues 
many medications marketed to treat alcohol or drug dependence are not administered until the patient is already abstinent  require long term chronic administration and must be taken several times a day to achieve the desired effect 
we believe that the structure of our business and operations as outlined above will be in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
however  the healthcare industry is highly regulated  and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures  courts  and enforcement and regulatory authorities 
our commercial viability is therefore subject to the legal and regulatory risks outlined in item a risk factors 
our operations we commenced operations in july and signed our first licensing agreement in november under our licensing agreements  we provide treatment providers access to our prometa protocols and marketing and sales support to attract patient referrals 
we receive a fee for the licensed technology and related services generally on a per patient basis 
as of december   we had entered into licensing agreements with hospitals and healthcare providers for sites throughout the united states 
we intend to enter into agreements with additional hospitals and other healthcare providers to increase both geographic penetration and the number of patients treated 
as revenues are generally related to the number of patients treated  key indicators of our financial performance will be the number of facilities and healthcare providers that license our technology  and the number of patients that are treated by those providers using our prometa protocols 
since july  over patients have completed treatment using our prometa protocols at our licensed sites and in research studies and commercial pilots being conducted to study our protocols 
in december  our senior vice president  medical affairs and renowned addiction medicine specialist  david smith  md  opened the prometa center  a new medical practice operating in a state of the art outpatient facility located in santa monica  california  that we built out under a lease agreement 
under the terms of a full service management agreement with dr 
smith s professional corporation  we manage the medical practice in exchange for management and licensing fees 
the practice has a primary focus on offering the prometa protocols for dependencies on alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamines but will also offer medical interventions for other 
table of contents substance dependencies  including buprenorphine therapy for the treatment of opiate dependence 
the prometa center is the first location primarily dedicated to the treatment of alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine dependence with the prometa protocols 
the revenues and expenses of the prometa center are included in our consolidated financial statements 
over the coming year  we will continue to expand our commercial operations  commence substantial direct to consumer marketing activities  and allocate significant and increasing resources to sales and marketing 
to date  patients treated with the prometa protocols have been primarily self pay patients 
however  in the first quarter  comprehensive behavioral care  inc compcare  a leading managed behavioral health care organization  approved prometa as reimbursable and entered into an agreement with us to market the prometa protocols to its managed care network providers 
we have also announced several pilot studies with state programs and drug court systems to study the results of using of the prometa protocols in their programs 
significant positive results from these studies would help in our efforts to gain third party reimbursement for providers using our protocols 
we do not currently operate our own healthcare facilities  employ our own treating physicians or provide medical advice or treatment to patients 
the hospitals  licensed healthcare facilities  and physicians that contract for the use of our technology own their facilities or professional licenses  and control and are responsible for the clinical activities provided on their premises 
patients receive medical care in accordance with orders from their attending physicians 
physicians with license rights to use the prometa protocols are responsible for exercising their independent medical judgment in determining the specific application of our protocols  and the appropriate course of care for each patient 
following the treatment procedure  local clinics and healthcare providers specializing in drug abuse treatment administer and provide continuing care treatment 
our market substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth 
substance dependence disorders affect many people and have wide ranging social consequences 
in  an estimated million americans suffered from alcohol or other forms of drug abuse or dependence  according to the national survey on drug use and health published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa  an agency of the us department of health and human services 
furthermore  according to the survey  approximately million americans age and older  or percent of the population  are reported as having tried methamphetamine  and the percentage of methamphetamine use characterized as abuse or dependence doubled from to findings from the drug and alcohol services information system dasis report published by samhsa s office of applied studies in september show that methamphetamine hospital admissions as a percent of substance abuse treatment admissions increased from in to in it is commonly reported that addiction to methamphetamine is an epidemic rapidly spreading throughout the us methamphetamine addicts are highly resistant to treatment and  even after intervention  relapse at very high rates 
methamphetamine use is also spreading to the workplace 
a study funded by the wal mart foundation in determined that each methamphetamine using employee costs his or her employer  per year in terms of lost productivity  absenteeism  higher healthcare costs and higher workers compensation costs 
for county governments and their taxpayers  methamphetamine abuse causes legal  medical  environmental and social problems 
a study entitled the criminal effect of meth on communities conducted in by the national association of counties  which surveyed counties in states  reported that of counties surveyed reported methamphetamine as their largest drug problem  with reporting increases in arrests involving methamphetamine starting years ago 
cocaine was reported as the number one drug problem in of the counties 
there are currently no generally accepted medical treatments for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence 
summarizing data from the office of national drug control policy ondcp and the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa  the economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse exceeds billion annually in the us  including billion in healthcare costs and approximately billion in productivity losses 
despite these staggering figures  it is a testament to the unmet need in the market that only of those who need treatment actually receive help 
traditional treatment methods are often not particularly effective  especially when it comes to those who are dependent on stimulants 
often faith  willpower  and counseling are the only options available 
compounding the lack of efficacious treatment options is the enormous stigma of leaving one s life  income  and loved ones for weeks at a time to seek inpatient treatment 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to samhsa that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
historically  the disease of substance dependence has been treated primarily through behavioral intervention  with fairly high relapse rates 
the dasis report states that in only of those treated for alcoholism and of those treated for cocaine and other stimulants complete detoxification  and that combined alcohol and cocaine outpatient treatment completion rates were only 
for patients who do complete treatment  the niaaa reports relapse rates three months following treatment for alcohol dependence to be 
relapse rates are higher for those suffering from cocaine dependence as opposed to alcohol 
for the behavioral treatment of cocaine dependence  the drug abuse treatment outcome survey reports a relapse rate of one year 
table of contents following outpatient treatment lasting or fewer days and one year following long term residential treatment lasting or fewer days 
while pharmacological options for alcohol dependence exist  none has proven to be effective enough to be generally accepted as a treatment in and of itself 
a number of pharmaceutical companies have introduced or intend to introduce drugs to treat alcohol dependence  however  many may require chronic or long term administration and their safety and tolerability profiles and relapse rates remain to be determined over periods of prolonged administration 
in addition  several of these drugs should not be used until the patient has already achieved abstinence  and must be administered on a chronic or long term continuing basis 
substance dependence as a disease recent scientific research provides evidence that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning but can also have long lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used 
at some point  changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence  a chronic  relapsing and sometimes fatal disease 
those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without treatment 
professional medical treatment is often necessary to end this physiologically based compulsive behavior 
we believe that the ability to successfully treat the physiological basis of substance dependence can improve treatment outcome  reduce the cost of treating dependence  and reduce the cost to society of the adverse consequences of alcohol and drug abuse by decreasing related criminality and violence and mitigating the costs associated with high risk behavior 
methamphetamine according to a national institute on drug abuse nida research report methamphetamine abuse and addiction january  the effects of methamphetamine use can include addiction  psychotic behavior  and brain damage 
methamphetamine is highly addictive and users trying to abstain from use may suffer withdrawal symptoms that include depression  anxiety  fatigue  paranoia  aggression  and intense cravings for the drug 
chronic methamphetamine use can cause violent behavior  anxiety  confusion  and insomnia 
users can also exhibit psychotic behavior including auditory hallucinations  mood disturbances  delusions  and paranoia  possibly resulting in homicidal or suicidal thoughts 
according to nida s report methamphetamine linked to long term damage to brain cells march  use of methamphetamine can cause damage to the brain that is detectable months after the use of the drug 
the damage to the brain caused by methamphetamine use is similar to damage caused by alzheimer s disease  stroke  and epilepsy 
alcohol according to niaaa  of all deaths due to liver cirrhosis are alcohol related  with most of these deaths occurring in people to years old 
one study found that to of all emergency room trauma cases involve alcohol use roizen  j  alcohol and trauma  
another study found that of asymptomatic alcoholic men exhibited evidence of cardiomyopathy rubin  e  the effects of alcoholism on skeletal and cardiac muscle  
the consequences of alcoholism and alcohol abuse affect most american families 
one study estimated that of all injury related hospital admissions are the result of alcoholism or alcohol problems waller j  diagnosis of alcoholism in the injured patient  
according to the national commission against drunk driving  nearly  americans are injured in alcohol related traffic crashes each year  resulting in  fatalities 
cocaine and crack cocaine cocaine and crack use place a heavy load upon our criminal justice system 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in october  of the  federal prisoners and of the million state prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
the ondcp reports that over of all arrestees test positive for cocaine or crack 
in  over of all federal defendants were charged with cocaine crack drug offenses 

table of contents the consequences of cocaine and crack use extend beyond the criminal justice system 
nida reports the medical complications of cocaine use to include heart arrhythmias and heart attacks  chest pain and respiratory failure  strokes  seizures  and headaches  as well as abdominal pain and nausea 
nida also notes that there have been no medications available to treat cocaine dependence 
our solution prometa those suffering from alcohol and or drug dependence have often been characterized as having social disorders or a lack of self discipline and  as noted above  there are relatively high relapse rates utilizing conventional treatment methods 
while we believe the psychological approach to substance dependence treatment is important  we recognize that physiological factors of substance dependence should be addressed first to provide patients with an improved chance for recovery 
we believe our physiological approach  focused on addressing the neurochemical imbalances in the brain caused or worsened by substance dependence  provides a substantial commercial opportunity 
current research indicates that substance dependence is associated with altered cortical activity and changes in neurotransmitter function  which are critical to brain function 
moreover  changes in the neurochemistry of the brain underlie the hallmarks of substance dependence  including tolerance  withdrawal symptoms  craving  decrease in cognitive function and relapse 
our prometa protocols include medically supervised treatments  prescription medications and nutritional supplements  combined with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy chosen by the patient in conjunction with their treatment provider 
the prometa treatment protocols provide for a comprehensive physical exam  including specific laboratory tests  prior to initiation of treatment by the treating physician  to determine if the patient is appropriate for the prometa protocol medically supervised administration of prescription medications and nutritional supplements one month of prescription medications and nutritional supplements following the initial treatment individualized continuing care options treatment with prometa involves the oral and intravenous administration of pharmaceuticals in a medically supervised setting 
the medications used in the prometa treatment protocols have been approved by the fda for uses other than treatment of substance dependence 
the prometa treatment is discreet and does not require long periods away from home or work 
treatment takes place at a hospital facility  clinic or properly equipped outpatient setting by healthcare providers who have licensed the rights to use our prometa protocols 
the treatment begins with a two to three day course of prescription medications and nutritional supplements 
the prometa protocol for stimulant dependence provides for a second  two day course of treatment at the facility  which takes place about three weeks after the initial treatment 
some patients may require an additional day of treatment  subject to the treating physician making this decision during the course of the treatment 
in general  the intravenous treatment session typically lasts about an hour 
some patients may receive their treatment in a hospital  or in patient setting 
for these patients  the balance of time spent at the treatment facility or hospital is intended to ensure that the patient is well rested and comfortable between the relatively short treatment periods 
most patients take meals and choose to sleep much of the time between treatments 
for the patients receiving care in an outpatient facility  such as a physician s office or treatment center  their doctor may monitor them for a few hours following the treatment session 
typically  the patient would then be released to an accompanying person and return the following day for completion of their treatment 
following the medically supervised treatments  our protocols provide that patients receive one month of prescription medication and nutritional supplements  and participation in psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy they select with their physician 
while there may be mild discomfort from inserting and removing the iv needle for intravenous administration of medications  the prometa protocols are designed to ensure that the patient is as comfortable as 
table of contents possible throughout the medically supervised procedures 
the prometa protocols are designed to minimize patient sedation 
some of the medications in the treatment regimen may cause temporary drowsiness 
based on our limited initial experience with a small number of patients in the us  patients who have been through prior treatment programs report that cravings for alcohol or stimulants are significantly reduced or eliminated with the prometa protocols  and that they emerge from treatment with greater mental clarity 
we believe prometa can offer an advantage to traditional alternatives for several reasons treatment provided using prometa is designed to address a spectrum of patient needs  including physiological  nutritional and psychological elements the prometa treatment protocols are targeted  medically supervised procedures designed to address the neurochemical imbalances in the brain caused or worsened by substance dependence 
the rationale for the approach is that by addressing the underlying physiological aspects of substance dependence  dependent persons may be better able to address the behavioral psychological and environmental components of their disease treatment using prometa does not require long periods away from home or work 
prometa offers the convenience of a two to three day treatment for addictive stimulants there is a second two day treatment three weeks later  as compared to traditional inpatient treatments which typically consist of approximately days of combined inpatient detoxification and recovery in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center our protocols may be appropriate for use at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement existing treatments 
additionally  we provide proprietary administrative services to assist physicians and facilities with staff education  marketing and sales support  and outcomes tracking for data analysis 
our strategy our business strategy is to provide quality  standard of care treatment protocols for those suffering from alcoholism and other substance dependencies 
we intend to grow our business through increased penetration to new licensees and increased patient volumes 
key elements of our business strategy include seeking to expand our base of treatment sites  focusing on major metropolitan service areas within the us increasing awareness about prometa among consumers and professional audiences through enhanced marketing and sales initiatives pursuing clinical data to make prometa a standard of care for treatment of alcohol  cocaine  and methamphetamine dependence 
establishing initiatives to help gain third party reimbursement for providers from private insurers  managed care  state medicaid programs and criminal justice systems acquiring or licensing new substance dependence treatment protocols that may be developed in the future our plan is to apply our technology to an existing industry we view as fragmented with participants that include healthcare providers such as physicians  psychologists  nurses  therapists  interventionists  counselors  hospitals  residential treatment centers  outpatient treatment facilities  and self help groups 
over time  we expect patients to be referred for treatment to physicians and treatment centers using our technology and through self referrals  patients family members  friends  employers and associated unions  as well as employee assistance 
table of contents programs  criminal justice systems  healthcare providers  third party payors  and government agencies 
we believe that the prometa protocols can provide a significant improvement to current treatment methodologies by addressing a spectrum of patient needs  including both physiological and psychological elements of substance dependence 
expand number of licensees in us we will focus on expanding our presence in the us private payor market by targeting major metropolitan service areas with high numbers of substance dependent individuals  and licensing our protocols and providing our services to healthcare providers in those areas 
we intend to add new licensees in our existing markets where we have established capacity in order to leverage our sales and marketing efforts on a cost effective basis 
we intend to utilize both local and national marketing initiatives to raise awareness of the prometa approach in order to increase patient awareness of the treatment protocols 
the marketing strategy will initially focus on consumers  by providing education and information that emphasizes substance dependence as a medically treatable disease  highlighting the potential benefits of prometa as an innovative  discreet and convenient medically supervised treatment approach  and encouraging consumers to consult their treatment providers or to phone our national call center for more information 
as data from our research studies become available  we plan to expand our marketing initiatives to more aggressively educate the professional community eg  physicians  counselors  therapists  payors and other allied professionals 
this staged strategic approach to our marketing efforts takes into account i the need to increase patient awareness of licensee sites  and ii that a more robust data dossier will be needed to facilitate broader adoption of prometa by the professional community 
the prometa center under the guidance of dr 
david smith  the prometa center should result in creating and expanding awareness of our protocols in the key metropolitan service area of los angeles 
by establishing a brand identity around this discreet  high end medical facility for addiction treatment  we intend to help lessen the stigma that surrounds those who are afflicted with this disease 
the added advantage that prometa is offered on an outpatient basis should encourage busy professionals to seek treatment 
with the addition of this center to our area licensees  we are in position to begin an aggressive marketing campaign for los angeles and the southern california region beginning in the first half of after our campaign gains momentum  the prometa center and all southern california licensees should benefit from the heightened visibility  resulting in increased patient volumes and inquiries from referral sources 
furthermore  any press or media exposure received by the prometa center will create name recognition for our protocols  thereby benefiting prometa licensees throughout the country 
clinical knowledge of prometa gathered by the physicians of the center will be available to current and potential licensees allowing third parties to witness the prometa treatment paradigm 
clinical data from research studies we believe that a key to our success will be the publication of results from research studies evaluating the prometa protocols conducted by leading research institutions and preeminent researchers in the field of alcohol and substance abuse 
to date  studies that we have announced include a multi site  randomized double blind placebo controlled study of prometa for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence conducted by dr 
walter ling of ucla a randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled study of prometa for the initiation  and extension of abstinence of alcoholism conducted by dr 
raymond anton at medical university of south carolina an open label study of prometa for methamphetamine dependence conducted by dr 
harold urschel a controlled study of hythiam s prometa protocols in the treatment of alcohol dependence conducted by dr 
jeffery wilkins at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles a pharmacoeconomic study to be conducted by the parallax center in new york city to compare outcomes achieved with the prometa protocol for alcohol dependency to the treatment program s 
table of contents current protocol 
we expect the results from dr 
harold urschel s study will be available in the first half of and will be significant  since we believe it may provide the first formal third party validation of prometa 
methamphetamine and cocaine dependence are top priorities at the state and drug court levels  and because of the similar pathophysiologies of these drugs  a treatment validated for one should be readily adopted for the other 
we believe the results from these studies will validate prometa as a method of care for treating alcoholism and stimulant dependence  as well as serve to accelerate our growth 
statewide agencies including medicaid  criminal justice sectors we plan to establish treatment using prometa as a covered treatment for state and county agencies in the public and criminal justice sectors in several states in through leveraging outcomes data results from the dr 
urschel methamphetamine study and the results of several commercial pilot studies that will be conducted in in these states 
we anticipate that the results of these pilots will serve as a template to rapidly increase adoption of prometa through the public and criminal justice systems of these states and other states throughout the country 
to date  we have announced the following pilot studies a pilot study by the city court of gary  indiana to evaluate our prometa protocols for use in drug courts for participants who are dependent on cocaine or cocaine and alcohol a patient  open label study conducted by southern university in the state of louisiana to test the efficacy of prometa for treatment of alcohol and substance dependent offenders accepted for drug court a pilot study  funded by the idaho department of health and welfare in collaboration with the criminal justice system as represented by the idaho supreme court s statewide drug court and mental health court coordinating committee  using prometa to evaluate its effectiveness as a medical treatment method for methamphetamine dependency  as well as its effect on reducing recidivism among criminal offenders a commercial pilot conducted by the department of social and health services and funded by the pierce county alliance in the state of washington to evaluate the success of treating methamphetamine dependent participants in the drug court system using the prometa protocols managed care we plan to position prometa with managed care providers and disease state management programs in order to become a covered benefit within the next two years 
in the first quarter  compcare  a leading managed behavioral health care organization  approved prometa as reimbursable and entered into an agreement with us to market the prometa protocols to its managed care network providers 
through this agreement  we will extend awareness of the prometa protocols to the employer groups and third party payors serviced by compcare  and its strategic marketing partner will work with compcare to market prometa to additional large employers  government groups and third party payers that are not current compcare customers 
the pharmacoeconomic study to be conducted by the parallax center in new york city will compare outcomes achieved with out prometa protocol for alcohol dependency to the parallax protocol  which is currently reimbursed by several insurers  including the largest membership based hmo in new york 
we believe that validation in this study will lead toward direct reimbursement for treatment using the prometa protocols not only by the parallax third party payors  but ultimately by other managed care providers as we intend to leverage these initial results for use as a template nationwide 
in we are planning to initiate several commercial pilot studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of prometa to additional managed care organizations 

table of contents international operations we intend to begin offering prometa at a clinic in europe in the first half of we also plan to begin operating small clinics on a pilot basis in europe for the treatment of nicotine or other dependencies in the first half of we will evaluate the success of these initial programs before we pursue additional international expansion 
sales and marketing we will focus our direct sales efforts on recruiting new healthcare providers in identified target markets to expand our number of treatment site customers 
our primary focus will be in major metropolitan service areas where we have already established a market presence in order to leverage our site managers  marketing efforts and brand awareness of prometa and benefit from resulting treatment volumes without capacity constraint 
our marketing strategy is based on developing and promoting a comprehensive treatment approach that integrates proprietary state of the art treatment protocols  assessment tools  education  and information about continuing care programs 
we will co promote programs with our licensees through community outreach initiatives  local sponsorship of professional education programs  public relations  local advocacy development and direct mail 
on a national level  we will promote our proprietary brands through internet marketing  advocacy development  targeted advertising  and public relations 
our marketing of the prometa protocols will be done in two ways promoting broad awareness focused target market initiatives broad awareness will be conducted via our consumer website  press releases  endorsements  printed media advertising  internet promotions and local radio  television and print media coverage 
we will support local targeted marketing efforts of the hospitals  healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers that license our prometa protocols 
additional target market campaigns may be accomplished via local publications  direct mail  seminars  forums  tradeshows  community outreach and email to generate referral sources and referrals 
community relations as noted above  a cornerstone to our marketing strategy will be to increase awareness among consumer audiences by providing education and information about substance dependence as a brain disease  and the prometa protocols as an innovative  convenient medically supervised treatment approach 
working in concert with our licensees  we intend to create or leverage community forums eg  community presentations  health fairs  etc 
that will provide opportunities to engage our target segments  most notably consumers ie  potential patients  their families and friends  leaders from the local business communities and professional referral sources within the healthcare community 
we also intend to utilize direct mail or other outreach vehicles to offer branded educational and informational materials to promote a direct and iterative dialogue with consumers and  pending data availability  professional constituents 
our community relations activities may also involve partnering with third party organizations on either a local or national level to further increase the penetration of these initiatives within targeted market segments  as well as provide a potential public relations platform to enhance the reach of the initiatives 
in january  we announced an award to the gay and lesbian medical association glma of an unrestricted educational grant to examine methamphetamine use in the gay community and related treatment options 
the methamphetamine epidemic has been ravaging the gay community for the last decade 
crystal meth is now directly linked to new hiv infections as well as an unprecedented resurgence of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases related to unsafe sexual behavior 
our grant will allow glma to examine the extent of methamphetamine use among gay and bisexual men and the most promising options for treating methamphetamine addiction  and to develop recommendations about how health care providers can get patients dependent on methamphetamine into treatment 

table of contents public relations the goal of our public relations program will be primarily to promote awareness and generate leads from consumers ie  potential patients  their families and friends  with a secondary emphasis on referral sources  healthcare professionals and third party organizations 
this may be done via press releases  endorsements  and media placement campaigns 
the forms of media that will be targeted for placement will be print media  local radio segments and stories  internet postings  local  regional  and national television segments and stories 
we believe this form of awareness lead generation to be superior to advertising both in terms of quality of awareness and number of leads generated 
advertising we anticipate that advertising will generally be limited to local publications in regional treatment center areas  specific trade publications for occupations with high substance dependence rates  healthcare professional publications with subscribers who would be good referral sources and top internet search engines 
we plan to test market direct to consumer advertising campaigns for the prometa center and our prometa protocols beginning in los angeles in the first half of  through the use of billboards  local radio and major newspapers 
if initial results are encouraging  we plan to begin rolling out an aggressive marketing campaign for the southern california area and other major markets 
target payor groups in developing our marketing plan  we have taken into consideration the following market dynamics for our efforts traditional payors private pay to date  patients treated with the prometa protocol have been primarily self pay patients 
until february  when a leading managed behavioral health care organization approved prometa as reimbursable for its provider network  our protocols had not been approved for payment by any health insurance companies or other third party payors 
according to reports by samhsa  of persons aged twelve or older who received any alcohol or illicit drug treatment  more paid for all or part of their most recent treatment with their own savings or earnings or those of family or friends than any other source 
we will continue to focus our efforts on targeted communication to private pay patients and their families emphasizing the convenience and potential benefits of treatment using the prometa protocols 
moreover  as we are aware of no generally accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence  we will have the opportunity to communicate the potential benefits of the prometa protocol to persons affected by methamphetamine dependence 
managed care  insurance and other third party reimbursement in addition to our goal of the prometa protocols becoming a preferred treatment method for individuals seeking to pay for treatment privately  we believe that third party payors  including entities from both the government and private sectors  will be important to our long term growth 
we will conduct business development initiatives to secure the acceptance and endorsement of treatment using our protocols as appropriate for reimbursement by third party payors  nationally recognized substance dependence treatment organizations and governmental organizations 
in order to compete effectively for managed care agreements and receive adequate reimbursement from payors for treatment using our protocols  clinical evidence must demonstrate that use of the prometa protocols is a beneficial and cost effective treatment approach 
we will  through our clinical 
table of contents and market research activities  gather and disseminate appropriate data to the payor community that should validate the benefits and cost effectiveness of treatment using the prometa protocols 
we believe that studies involving the prometa protocols have the potential to demonstrate cost effectiveness across patient populations 
in december  we announced a pharmacoeconomic study by a preeminent researcher and executive director of a substance abuse treatment center in new york city to compare outcomes achieved with the prometa protocol for alcohol dependency to the treatment program s current protocol  which is currently reimbursed by several insurers including the largest membership based hmo in new york 
as standardized treatment outcomes are significant for the third party payor community  we anticipate that validation in this study will lead toward direct reimbursement for prometa and ultimately  will allow for a solution that can be replicated across their entire network 
if successful  our intent is to leverage these initial results nationwide for use as a template that other managed care providers can rapidly integrate into their networks 
in february  we announced that our prometa protocols have successfully passed review by the technology committee of compcare  and are now approved as reimbursable treatments 
compcare is a leading provider of behavioral health care services to managed care organizations  serving medicaid  medicare  and commercial payors 
compcare and its strategic marketing partner will market prometa to its existing and new third party payor clients as an integral component of a new substance abuse and addiction disease management program 
other payor groups criminal justice systems drug and alcohol offenders impact all divisions of criminal justice including law enforcement  drug courts  probation  and correctional facilities 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in october  approximately of the million state and of the  federal prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
a significant number of state and federal prisoners receive alcohol treatment after admission into prison  or after incarceration during the re entry period while under community supervision 
the ondcp estimates that more than of the sentenced federal inmate population will have a diagnosable substance disorder which requires some type of drug abuse treatment program 
we believe that state and federal prison systems are in need of a more beneficial and convenient treatment alternative and we intend to solicit major prison systems to utilize our protocols 
more importantly  we will seek to work with state and federal criminal justice systems to intervene prior to incarceration with a goal of reducing the number of drug offenders admitted into prison 
drug courts first came to prominence in as a means to deal with the growing number of alleged offenders involved with substance abuse 
according to the national drug court institute there were over  drug courts in located in all states 
drug courts generally encourage the user to seek treatment in lieu of incarceration 
we will seek to engage and educate all parties judges  attorneys  physicians  counselors that influence the selection of the drug treatment facility 
as discussed above  we have announced commercial pilots with the states of louisiana  indiana  idaho and washington in to evaluate the effectiveness of our prometa protocols as a medical treatment method for methamphetamine dependency  cocaine or cocaine and alcohol  as well as its effect on reducing recidivism among criminal offenders 
if these and other state government and criminal justice system studies that we plan to initiate over the coming year are successful in validating prometa as an effective treatment approach  our intent is to leverage these initial results by marketing the outcomes from these studies to other state agencies and criminal justice systems throughout the country 

table of contents initial data the prometa treatment protocols have been in use since at the little company of mary san pedro hospital 
retrospective data collected on alcohol and stimulant dependent patients treated with prometa from november through december suggest promising results in terms of treatment completion rates  abstinence rates and reduction of cravings based on patient follow up ranging from three to twelve months post treatment 
the outcome results are summarized below for alcohol patients and stimulant patients  of whom approximately had unsuccessfully undergone prior treatment  who were followed for days and days post treatment days post treatment alcohol continuous abstinence use with no problems relapsed unknown total patients stimulants cocaine and days post treatment methamphetamine continuous abstinence use with no problems relapsed unknown total patients patients reporting use of the substance at least once post treatment  but not returning to harmful or compulsive use 
following treatment  patient self reports include elimination of cravings and increased mental clarity and focus cognitive function 
further  patients were asked to rate their quality of life before and after treatment  most of whom reported both immediate and sustained post treatment improvement in sleep  appetite  mood  concentration  memory  work  relationships and stress 
the outcomes shown above are for patients treated with the current prometa protocols in one treatment center 
outcome information was obtained by follow up phone interview by the clinical site manager 
the limited initial results of the retrospective evaluation were not obtained in a formal research study  may not provide a sufficient sample size to draw any conclusions regarding effectiveness  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
in addition  patients statuses may change after longer periods of post treatment follow up  negatively affecting the overall results of the treatment outcomes that were collected during the post treatment period 
we have awarded and are in the process of awarding additional unrestricted grants for research studies in special populations and controlled studies to evaluate the use of the prometa protocols 
formal research  further studies  independent research reports or reviews may qualify or contradict the limited results that we have observed 
research and development we have announced a number of clinical studies by preeminent researchers in the field of substance dependence to evaluate the use of prometa in treating alcohol and stimulant dependence 
we anticipate that these studies will be the basis for publication in scientific journals 
we expect initial data from the first methamphetamine study to be made available in the first half of in addition  we have contracted with a contract research 
table of contents organization cro to establish a clinical outcomes registry for the monitoring and evaluation of up to patients undergoing treatment using prometa at our commercial licensee sites 
we have also announced several pilot studies with state programs and drug court systems to study the results of using the prometa protocols in their programs 
significant positive results would help in our efforts to gain third party reimbursement for providers using our protocols 
patients treated to date with prometa have been substantially self pay patients 
we believe that favorable clinical data in combination with third party reimbursement would help accelerate broader adoption of prometa 
we intend to continually enhance our substance dependence treatment technology and products as well as research and develop new products to maintain technological competitiveness and deliver increasing value to new and existing customers 
we also intend to continue to expand our target markets by acquiring or licensing treatment methods for other substance dependencies as new technology is developed and becomes available 
competition conventional forms of treatment for alcohol dependence are usually divided into phases detoxification or withdrawal  which is typically conducted in medically supervised environments  and relapse prevention  which is often conducted through short or long term therapeutic facilities or programs  most of which do not offer medical management options 
typically such medically managed programs require long term usage of pharmaceuticals  resulting in low patient compliance 
conventional forms of treatment for stimulant dependence consist only of relapse prevention  which is conducted through therapeutic programs  which do not offer medical management options 
regardless of the approach  there is great variability in the duration of treatment procedures  level of medical supervision  cost to the patients and relapse rates 
currently accepted practice for withdrawing patients from a dependence on alcohol consists of heavily sedating the patient at an inpatient hospital facility for a period of to days 
due to the heavy sedation  the patient typically is stabilized for an additional to days 
this procedure  while medically necessary to prevent medically severe withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens when withdrawing alcoholics from alcohol  does not relieve the patient s cravings or desire to drink 
further  the drugs typically used during this procedure the most commonly utilized medications are valium diazepam  ativan lorazepam  and xanax alprazolam can be addictive  require a time intensive dose tapering and washout period and may cause side effects 
while withdrawal from cocaine dependence is not considered to involve a significant risk of death  withdrawal symptoms from current detoxification procedures are unpleasant 
following an extended period of dependence  cocaine addicts generally are unable to experience the feeling of pleasure during and following detoxification as a result of the effects of cocaine on the brain 
detoxification procedures typically involve the use of sedatives to assist patients through this difficult period 
following treatment  cue induced cravings  however  are especially pronounced and may re occur for months to years 
treatment programs there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha that provide substance dependence medical treatment services on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
there appears to be no reliable information about the success rates of these programs  nor agreed upon standards of how outcomes should be measured eg  self reported abstinence or reduction in days of heavy drinking 
many of these traditional treatment programs have established name recognition and their treatments may be covered in large part by insurance or other third party payors 
to date  treatments using our protocols have generally not been covered by insurance  and patients treated with the prometa protocols have been substantially self pay patients  currently our primary market for the prometa protocol 
however  in february  a leading managed behavioral health care organization approved prometa as reimbursable  and entered into an agreement with us to market the prometa protocols to its managed care network providers 

table of contents treatment medications there are currently no accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence 
anti depressants and dopamine agonists have been investigated as possible maintenance therapies  but none have been fda approved or are generally accepted for medical practice 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia by bristol myers squib  for treatment of alcohol dependence 
however  naltrexone must be administered on a chronic or continuing basis and is associated with relatively high rates of side effects  including nausea 
us sales are estimated to be just under million per year for this treatment 
alkermes is developing a long acting injectable form of naltrexone  vivitrol  intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
the company reported results from a phase iii clinical study indicated that in the overall study population  patients treated with vivitrol mg experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
alkermes  in partnership with cephalon  reports it intends to launch vivitrol in the second quarter of  pending final fda approval 
forest laboratories holds the license in the us to market campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  approved by the fda in acamprosate is an nmda receptor antagonist 
the product must be taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
clinical studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol  but the product was not effective for patients who had not undergone detoxification and who were not abstinent prior to treatment 
several classes of pharmaceutical agents have been investigated as potential maintenance agents eg  anti depressants and dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence  however  none are fda approved for treatment of cocaine dependence or generally accepted in medical practice 
their effects are variable in terms of providing symptomatic relief  and many of the agents may cause side effects or may not be well tolerated by patients 
as noted above  we believe the prometa protocols can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other existing treatments 
as such  our protocols offer a potentially valuable addition to traditional medical treatment 
moreover  because treatment with the prometa protocols is designed to target neurochemical imbalances in the brain over a short course of treatment  we do not view the current medical therapies as directly competitive 
we believe that the total cost of providing treatment using the prometa protocols falls within the typical range of prices for conventional treatment programs 
we also believe  based on the limited initial results discussed below  that treatment using our protocols may have higher completion rates  greater compliance  reduction or elimination of withdrawal symptoms  reduction or elimination of cravings  improved cognitive functioning and potentially lower relapse rates 
development of our technology much of our proprietary  patented and patent pending substance dependence technology  known as the prometa treatment protocols  was developed by dr 
juan jos legarda  a european scientist educated at university of london who has spent most of his professional career conducting research related to substance abuse 
through his studies and research  dr 
legarda identified some of the adverse physical effects of substance abuse on the brain and began to develop technologies that specifically focused on the neurochemistry of the brain as a core part of addictive behavior modification 
in  dr 
legarda filed patent cooperation treaty pct applications in spain for treatment protocols that he developed for dependencies to alcohol and cocaine 
we acquired the rights to these patent filings in march through a technology purchase and license agreement with dr 
legarda s company  tratamientos avanzados de la adiccion sl  to which we pay a royalty of three percent of the amount the 
table of contents patient pays for treatment using our protocols 
after acquiring these rights  we filed us patent applications and other national phase patent applications based on the pct filings  as well as provisional us patent applications for additional treatment protocols for alcohol  cocaine and other addictive stimulants 
if any of these patents are issued  they will expire years from the dates of original filing 
proprietary rights and licensing our success depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to help ensure compliance with our license joint venture agreements  we employ site managers in each of our major markets 
we have the following branded trade names hythiam prometa prometa protocol prometa protocols prometa treatment protocol prometa treatment protocols prometa center prometa centers prometa treatment prometa treatments we impose restrictions in our protocol license agreements on our customers rights to utilize and disclose our technology 
we also seek to protect our intellectual property by generally requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to our proprietary information 
we require that  as a condition of their employment  employees assign to us their interests in inventions  original works of authorship  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights conceived or developed by them during their employment with us

risk factors you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below  that may not be presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also harm our business and operations 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history  making it difficult to evaluate our future performance we have a limited history of operations 
we were formed in february and commenced operations in june investors have limited substantive financial information on prior operations to evaluate the company as an investment 
our potential must be viewed in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  delays and complications often encountered in the operation of a new business 
we will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of a company with a limited operating history such as regulatory setbacks and delays  fluctuations in expenses  competition  the general strength of regional and national economies  and governmental regulation 
any failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties would seriously harm our business and prospects 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses  and if we are not able to raise necessary additional funds we may have to reduce or stop operations we have not generated significant revenues or become profitable  may never do so  and may not generate sufficient working capital to cover the cost of operations 
our revenues since commencement of operations in june were million through december  our accumulated deficit through december  was million 
we anticipate that operating deficits will continue for at least the next twelve months of our operations 
because many of our costs generally will increase  the cost of operating the company will exceed the income therefrom during this period 
no party has guaranteed to advance additional funds to us to provide for any such operating deficits 
our cash and marketable securities totaled approximately million as of december  our fourth quarter net cash burn rate was approximately million per month 
we expect to increase our monthly expenditures over the next twelve months as we increase staff  commence marketing activities  expand the number of licensees and provide funding for research studies 
if our revenues do not meet expectations and our expenses continue to increase  our cash reserves will be exhausted in fifteen to eighteen months  and we will be required to seek additional funds 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings or collaborative arrangements 
if we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements  these arrangements may require us to relinquish greater rights to our technologies and protocols than we might otherwise have done 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  or securities convertible into equity  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt  our business may be affected by the amount of leverage we incur  and our borrowings may subject us to restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  reduce or stop operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on third party healthcare providers licensing and using our protocols  and if they delay or fail to do so our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected only a physician may treat or supervise the treatment of patients using the prometa protocols  which requires us to enter into licenses with physicians  hospitals  properly equipped outpatient settings or other treatment facilities in order to provide convenient treatment access points for patients 
our revenues are therefore dependent to a significant degree upon the relationships we can establish with physicians  hospitals and other healthcare facilities to license our protocols for treating their patients 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from only three licensees 
as of december   we had entered into licensing agreements for sites throughout the 
table of contents united states  of which were added in the number of patients who were treated by our licensees in was approximately  and in the last six months of was approximately additional rollout is anticipated to be dependent on our ability to negotiate and conclude licensing agreements with such healthcare providers across the country and their ability to generate patients 
if we are unable to enter into similar arrangements with these additional healthcare providers for any reason  that would significantly limit our growth potential and negatively impact our business prospects 
in addition  if physicians  hospitals and healthcare providers do not attract sufficient patient volume and revenue they may not be willing to continue to offer our protocols 
the success of our protocols is largely dependent upon referrals of patients to facilities that license our technology and upon the use of our protocols by physicians in treating their patients 
there is no requirement for physicians to refer their patients to facilities that license our protocols  or to use our protocols in treating their patients 
they are free to refer patients to any other substance dependence treatment service  program or facility  and to treat their patients using whatever method they determine to be in the patients best interests 
the failure of physicians to treat a sufficient number of patients using our protocols  or to refer patients to facilities that use our protocols  or the loss of physicians that use our protocols would have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we may fail to successfully manage and maintain the growth of our business  which could adversely affect our results of operations as we continue expanding our operations  sales and marketing activities  this expansion could put significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
to manage future growth  we will need to continue to hire  train and manage additional employees  particularly a specially trained sales force to market our protocols 
concurrent with expanding our operational and marketing activities  we will also be increasing our research and development activities  including the development of protocols for other types of addictions  with the expectation of ultimately commercializing those products 
we have maintained a small financial and accounting staff  and our reporting obligations as a public company  as well as our need to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  the rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq national market  will continue to place significant demands on our financial and accounting staff  on our financial  accounting and information systems and on our internal controls 
as we grow  we will need to add additional accounting staff and continue to improve our financial  accounting and information systems and internal controls in order to fulfill our reporting responsibilities and to support expected growth in our business 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth or management may not be able to effectively hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to achieve our marketing and commercialization goals or to satisfy our reporting and other obligations as a public company 
our treatment protocols may not be as effective as we believe them to be  which could limit or prevent us from maintaining revenues our belief in the efficacy of our treatment protocols is based on a limited number of unpublished studies  primarily in spain  and our limited initial experience with a small number of patients in the united states 
such results may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance and safety of our protocols 
controlled scientific studies  including those that have been announced and planned for the future  may yield results that are unfavorable or demonstrate that our protocols are not clinically effective or safe 
while we have not experienced such problems to date  if the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated or maintained over time  utilization of our protocols could decline substantially 
our marketing efforts may not result in acceptance of our protocols in the marketplace  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings while we have been able to generate initial interest in our protocols among a limited number of healthcare providers  there can be no assurance that our efforts or the efforts of others will be successful in fostering acceptance of our protocols in the target markets 
if our marketing and promotional efforts are not as successful as we expect them to be  the likelihood of expending all of our funds prior to reaching a level of profitability will be increased 

table of contents marketplace acceptance of our protocols may largely depend upon healthcare providers interpretation of our limited data  the results of pending studies  or upon reviews and reports that may be given by independent researchers 
we have awarded and are in the process of awarding additional unrestricted grants to academic and affiliated research institutions and other research organizations interested in conducting research studies of our prometa protocols 
as of december   we have committed to spending approximately million over the next twenty four months to fund unrestricted grants 
in the event such research does not give our treatment technology high approval ratings  it is unlikely we will be able to achieve significant market acceptance 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully the healthcare business in general  and the substance dependence treatment business in particular  are highly competitive 
hospitals and healthcare providers that treat substance dependence are highly competitive  and we must convince them that they will benefit by use of our protocols 
we will compete with many types of substance dependence treatment methods  treatment facilities and other service providers  many of whom are more established and better funded than we are 
many of these other treatment methods most of which involve only a single drug and facilities are well established in the same markets we will target  have substantial sales volume  and are provided and marketed by companies with much greater financial resources  facilities  organization  reputation and experience than we have 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia by bristol myers squib  for treatment of alcohol dependence 
however  naltrexone must be administered on a chronic or continuing basis and is associated with relatively high rates of side effects  including nausea 
us sales are estimated to be just under million per year for this treatment 
alkermes is developing a long acting injectable form of naltrexone  vivitrol  intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
the company reported results from a phase iii clinical study indicating that in the overall study population  patients treated with vivitrol mg experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
alkermes  in partnership with cephalon  reports it intends to launch vivitrol in the second quarter of  pending final fda approval 
forest laboratories holds the license in the us to market campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  approved by the fda in acamprosate is an nmda receptor antagonist 
the product must be taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
clinical studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol  but the product was not effective for patients who had not undergone detoxification and who were not abstinent prior to treatment 

table of contents we see these products as being potentially useful during the continuing care phase of treatment following treatment using the prometa protocols  but not being directly competitive 
to the best of our knowledge  there are no treatment protocols or medications approved  marketed or in development within the us that reduce the cravings for cocaine  methamphetamine or other additive prescription psychostimulants 
however  our competitors may develop and introduce new processes and products that are equal or superior to our protocols in treating substance dependencies 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by any new processes and technology developed by our competitors 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
there are several points of resistance to penetrating the substance dependence treatment market 
first  there is the historical focus on the use of psychological or behavioral therapies as opposed to medical or physiological treatments for substance dependence 
healthcare providers and potential patients may be resistant to the transition of treating substance dependence as a disease rather than as a behavioral aberration 
second  healthcare providers may be reluctant to use our protocols due to the absence of published clinical studies supporting their efficacy 
research studies of the prometa protocols may not lead to acceptable results or the results may not be published 
if we are unable to penetrate these substantial barriers to entry we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could impact the ability to manage our business our future success depends on the performance of our senior management and our key professional personnel 
it therefore depends to a significant extent on retaining the services of our key executive officers  in particular our chairman and chief executive officer  terren s 
peizer  our director and chief administrative officer  richard anderson  our director and chief operating officer  anthony m 
lamacchia  and our chief financial officer  chuck timpe 
each of these key executives is party to an employment agreement which  subject to termination for cause or good reason  has a remaining term of two to three years 
while we believe our relationships with our executives are good and do not anticipate any of them leaving in the near future  the loss of the services of mr 
peizer or any other key member of management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
while we have not experienced any problems in attracting and retaining desirable employees  our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified management  professional  administrative and sales personnel to support our future growth 
we are subject to personal injury claims  which could result in substantial liabilities that may exceed our insurance coverage all significant medical treatments and procedures  including treatment utilizing our protocols  involve the risk of serious injury or death 
even under proper medical supervision  withdrawal from alcohol may cause severe physical reactions 
while we do not treat patients or determine whether treatment using our protocols is appropriate for any particular patient  and have not been the subject of any personal injury claims for patients treated by providers using our protocols  our business entails an inherent risk of claims for personal injuries  which are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards 
we cannot control whether individual physicians will properly select patients  apply the appropriate standard of care  or conform to our protocols in determining how to treat their patients 
a significant source of potential liability is negligence or alleged negligence by physicians treating patients using our protocols 
while our agreements typically require them to indemnify us for their negligence  there can be no assurance they will be willing and financially able to do so if claims are made 
in addition  our license agreements require us to indemnify physicians  hospitals or their affiliates for losses resulting from our negligence 
there can be no assurance that a future claim or claims will not be successful or  including the cost of legal defense  will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage 
we currently have insurance coverage for up to million per year for personal injury claims 
we may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance  in accordance with standard industry practice  with appropriate coverage based on the nature and risks of our business  at acceptable costs and on favorable terms 
insurance carriers are often reluctant to provide liability insurance for new healthcare services companies and products due to the 
table of contents limited claims history for such companies and products 
in addition  based on current insurance markets  we expect that liability insurance will be more difficult to obtain and that premiums will increase over time and as the volume of patients treated with our protocols increases 
in the event of litigation  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  or an award against us during a time when we have no available insurance or insufficient insurance  we may sustain significant losses of our operating capital which may substantially impair or destroy the investments of stockholders 
if government and third party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate payment rates for treatment using our protocols  our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed our future revenue growth will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payors for treatment providers using our protocols 
such third party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage on which procedures they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new procedures 
as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for treatment using our protocols 
we might need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of treatment using our protocols to such payors satisfaction 
such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources 
adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on investment in research and product development  and the lack of such reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
our planned international operations may be subject to foreign regulation  and the success of our foreign operations will depend on many factors 
while we will establish policies and procedures that we believe will be sufficient to ensure that we operate in substantial compliance with applicable foreign laws  regulations and requirements  the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
our international operations may become the subject of foreign regulatory  civil  criminal or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention 
thus  any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our international business and our plan to expand our international operations  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if we fail to comply with any applicable international laws  or a determination is made that we have failed to comply with these laws  our financial condition and results of operations  including our domestic operations  could be adversely affected 
in addition private pay healthcare system in europe is not as developed as in the us and as a result it may be more difficult to convince patients in these countries to pay or to pay substantial amounts for treatment 
we will be reliant on relationships that we establish with local companies  thought leaders and governments 
there can be no assurance we will be able to establish these relationships  maintain them or that the partners will retain their influence in the market 
it may take longer than we expect to commence operations or to operate our business at profitable levels as we do not have the established relationships and knowledge of the regulations and business practices in the markets we are entering 
risks related to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect the proprietary treatment protocols which are the core of our business we consider the protection of our proprietary treatment protocols to be critical to our business prospects 

table of contents we obtained the rights to some of our most significant patent pending technologies through a license agreement which is subject to a number of conditions and restrictions  and a breach or termination of that agreement could significantly impact our ability to use and develop our technologies 
we currently have no issued us patents covering our prometa protocols 
in addition  the patent applications we have filed and licensed may not issue as patents  and any issued patents may be too narrow in scope to provide us with a competitive advantage 
our patent position is uncertain and includes complex factual and legal issues  including the existence of prior art that may preclude or limit the scope of patent protection 
other inventors may have filed earlier patent applications of which we are unaware and which may prevent our applications from being granted 
patent examiners and third parties may object to the validity or scope of some or all of our claims 
any of the patents that may be issued to us will expire twenty years after they were first filed 
competitors or others may institute challenges against the validity or enforceability of any patent owned by us  and if successful our patents may be denied  rendered unenforceable  or invalidated 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents  and to protect and prevent infringement of patents can be substantial 
maintaining  prosecuting  and enforcing a patent portfolio might require funds that may not be available 
we may not be able to adequately protect the aspects of our treatment protocols that are not subject to patent protection  or are subject to only limited patent protection 
furthermore  competitors and others may independently develop similar or more advanced treatment protocols and technologies  may design around aspects of our technology  or may discover or duplicate our trade secrets and proprietary methods 
to the extent we utilize processes and technology that constitute trade secrets under applicable laws  we must implement appropriate levels of security for those trade secrets to secure the protection of such laws  which we may not do effectively 
for some of our proprietary rights  we may need to secure assignments of rights from independent contractors and third parties to perfect our rights  and if we fail to do so they may retain ownership rights in the intellectual property upon which our business is based 
policing compliance with our confidentiality agreements and unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we may be unable to determine whether piracy of our technology has occurred 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united states 
while we have not had any significant issues to date  the loss of any of our trade secrets or proprietary rights which may be protected under the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of our competitive advantage over present and potential competitors 
confidentiality agreements with employees  licensees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we rely in part on confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  licensees  treating physicians and others 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
to date we have had one instance  in february  in which it was necessary to send a formal demand to cease and desist using our protocols to treat patients to a consultant who had signed a confidentiality agreement 
he subsequently complied with the demand and signed an innovation  proprietary information and confidentiality agreement  and an intellectual property assignment agreement 
we may not be able to adequately protect our other intellectual property rights  which could limit our ability to compete while we believe we have proprietary ownership  assigned or licensed rights in intellectual property which is capable of protection under federal trademark  copyright and or patent laws  and under state laws regarding trade secrets  we may not have taken  or in the future may not take  appropriate legal measures  and may not be able to adequately secure the necessary protections for our intellectual property 
we currently have no issued us patents protecting our prometa protocols  and have not yet registered all of our trademarks or copyrights and  until we do 
table of contents so  we must rely on various state and common law rights for enforcement of the rights to exclusive use of our trade secrets  trademark and copyrights 
although hythiam is a registered trademark  our trademark applications for our prometa trademarks are pending before the us patent and trademark office  and we have not yet been granted registration for these marks 
if our trademark registrations are objected to or denied that may impact our ability to use and protect our brand names and company and product identity 
although we have applied for trademarks for some of our brand names  and patents on some of our technology  in the future we may decide not to secure federal protection of certain copyrights  trademarks or patents to which we may be entitled 
failure to do so  in the case of copyrights and trademarks  may reduce our access to the courts  and to certain remedies of statutory damages and attorneys fees  to which we may be entitled in the event of a violation of our proprietary and intellectual rights by third parties 
similarly  the failure to seek issuance of any patents to which we may be entitled may result in loss of patent protection should a third party copy the patentable technology 
the loss of any proprietary rights which are protectable under any of the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of a competitive advantage over present or potential competitors  with a resulting decrease in revenues and profitability for us 
there is no guarantee that such a loss of competitive advantage could be remedied or overcome by us at a price which we would be willing or able to pay  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business our future operations may be subject to claims  and potential litigation  arising from our alleged infringement of patents  trade secrets or copyrights owned by other third parties 
we intend to fully comply with the law in avoiding such infringements 
however  within the healthcare  drug and bio technology industry  established companies have actively pursued such infringements  and have initiated such claims and litigation  which has made the entry of competitive products more difficult 
we may experience such claims or litigation initiated by existing  better funded competitors 
court ordered injunctions may prevent us from bringing new products to market  and the outcome of litigation and any resulting loss of revenues and expenses of litigation may substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations 
risks related to our industry the healthcare industry in which we operate is subject to substantial regulation by state and federal authorities  which could hinder  delay or prevent us from commercializing our protocols the healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid  traditional indemnity insurers  managed care organizations and other private payors increase efforts to control cost  utilization and delivery of healthcare services 
although our licensees do not currently bill or seek reimbursement from medicare  medicaid or other governmental organizations for the treatment of patients using the prometa protocols  we are nevertheless subject to the overall effect of the changes created by increased cost control and financial pressures on the industry 
healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal  state and local laws  regulations and judicial decisions governing various matters such as the licensing and certification of facilities and personnel  the conduct of operations  billing policies and practices  policies and practices with regard to patient privacy and confidentiality  and prohibitions on payments for the referral of business and self referrals 
there are federal and state laws  regulations and judicial decisions that govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships  submission of healthcare claims and inducement to beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs 
many states prohibit business corporations from practicing medicine  employing or maintaining control over physicians who practice medicine  or engaging in certain business practices  such as splitting fees with healthcare providers 
many healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business are complex  applied broadly and subject to interpretation by courts and government agencies 
our failure  or the failure of our licensees  to comply with these healthcare laws and regulations could create liability for us and negatively impact our business 

table of contents in addition  the food and drug administration fda  regulates development  testing  labeling  manufacturing  marketing  promotion  distribution  record keeping and reporting requirements for prescription drugs  medical devices and biologics 
other regulatory requirements apply to dietary supplements including vitamins 
compliance with laws and regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory agencies may be required relative to our protocols or any other medical products or services developed or used by us 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in various adverse consequences  including withdrawal of our protocols from the market  the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions  or the required modification or redesign of our protocols 
we may not have the financial resources to modify our protocols or implement new techniques 
accordingly  our ability to market our protocols in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be a threshold test for our survival 
we believe that this industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation  political and legal action and pricing pressures  the scope and effect of which we cannot predict 
legislation is continuously being proposed  enacted and interpreted at the federal  state and local levels to regulate healthcare delivery and relationships between and among participants in the healthcare industry 
any such changes could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products and services for a period of time or permanently 
we may be subject to regulatory and investigative proceedings  which may find that our policies and procedures do not fully comply with complex and changing healthcare regulations while we have established policies and procedures that we believe will be sufficient to ensure that we operate in substantial compliance with applicable laws  regulations and requirements  the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
we may become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention 
thus  any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if we fail to comply with any applicable laws  or a determination is made that we have failed to comply with these laws  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the promotion of our protocols may be found to violate federal law concerning off label uses of prescription drugs  which could prevent us from marketing our protocols the food drug cosmetic fdc act  requires that prescription drugs be approved for a specific medical indication by the fda prior to their marketing in interstate commerce 
in addition  promotion of dietary supplements for uses beyond those permitted by law may be treated as the unlawful promotion of drugs absent fda approval 
violations of the fdc act may result in either civil seizure or injunction or criminal penalties 
our procedural medical protocols call for the use of prescription drugs for the treatment of chemical dependence and drug addiction  conditions not approved for use in the drugs official labeling  and physicians prescribe and use these drugs when treating patients using our protocols 
in addition  our protocols include the use of nutritional supplements 
while the fda generally does not regulate licensed physicians who prescribe approved drugs for non approved or off label uses in the independent practice of medicine  our promotion of our protocols through advertising and other means may be found to violate fda regulations or the fdc act 
the fda has broad discretion in interpreting those regulations 
if the fda determines that our promotion of our medical treatment protocols violates the fdc act or brings an enforcement action against us for violating the fdc act or fda regulations that is successful  our promotion of our protocols will have to stop and we may be unable to continue operating under our current business model 
even if we defeat any fda challenge  the expenses associated with defending the claim or negative publicity concerning the off label use of drugs in our protocols could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
treatment using our protocols may be found to require review or approval  which could delay or prevent the study or use of our protocols the fda asserts jurisdiction over many clinical trials  or experiments  in which a drug is administered to human subjects 
hospitals and clinics have established institutional review boards  or irbs  to review and approve clinical trials using investigational treatments in their facilities 
certain investigations involving new drugs or off label uses for approved drugs must be the subject of an fda investigational new drug exemption ind 
use of our 
table of contents treatment protocol by individual physicians in treating their patients may be found to constitute a clinical trial or investigation that requires irb review or an ind 
fda has broad authority in interpreting and applying its regulations  so it may find that use of our protocols by our licensees or collection of outcomes data on that use constitutes a clinical investigation subject to irb and fda jurisdiction and may take enforcement action against us 
individual hospitals and physicians may also submit their use of our protocols in treatment to their irbs and individual irbs may find that use to be a clinical trial that requires fda approval or they may prohibit or place restrictions on that use 
any of these results may adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers to use our protocols 
failure to comply with the federal trade commission act or similar state laws could result in sanctions or limit the claims we can make the company s promotional activities and materials  including advertising to consumers and physicians  and materials provided to licensees for their use in promoting our protocols  are regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act  which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices  including claims which are false  misleading or inadequately substantiated 
the ftc typically requires competent and reliable scientific tests or studies to substantiate express or implied claims that a product or service is effective 
if the ftc were to interpret our promotional materials as making express or implied claims that our protocols are effective for the treatment of alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine addiction  it may find that we do not have adequate substantiation for such claims 
failure to comply with the ftc act or similar laws enforced by state attorneys general and other state and local officials could result in administrative or judicial orders limiting or eliminating the claims we can make about our protocols  and other sanctions including fines 
our business practices may be found to constitute illegal fee splitting or corporate practice of medicine  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business many states  including california in which our principal executive offices are located  have laws that prohibit business corporations  such as us  from practicing medicine  exercising control over medical judgments or decisions of physicians  or engaging in certain arrangements  such as employment or fee splitting  with physicians 
courts  regulatory authorities or other parties  including physicians  may assert that we are engaged in the unlawful corporate practice of medicine by providing administrative and ancillary services in connection with our protocols  or that licensing our technology for a portion of the patient fees  or subleasing space and providing turn key business management to affiliated medical groups in exchange for management and licensing fees  constitute improper fee splitting  in which case we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable  in whole or in part  or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements 
there can be no assurance that this will not occur or  if it does  that we would be able to restructure our contractual arrangements on favorable terms 
our business practices may be found to violate anti kickback  self referral or false claims laws  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to financial relationships and kickbacks involving healthcare providers  physician self referral arrangements  filing of false claims and other fraud and abuse issues 
federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit certain offers  payments or receipts of remuneration in return for i referring patients covered by medicare  medicaid or other federal health care program  or ii purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending any service  good  item or facility for which payment may be made by a federal health care program 
in addition  federal physician self referral legislation  commonly known as the stark law  generally prohibits a physician from ordering certain services reimbursable by medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare program from any entity with which the physician has a financial relationship 
while providers who license our protocols currently do not seek such third party reimbursement for treatment using our protocols  we anticipate they may do so in the future 
in addition  many states have similar laws  some of which are not limited to services reimbursed by federal healthcare programs 
other federal and state laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement  or false claims laws 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal false claims act  and violations of other laws  such as the anti kickback laws or the fda prohibitions against promotion of off label uses of drugs  may also be prosecuted as violations of the false claims act 

table of contents while we believe we have structured our relationships to comply with all applicable requirements  federal or state authorities may claim that our fee arrangements  agreements and relationships with contractors  hospitals and physicians violate these anti kickback  self referral or false claims laws and regulations 
these laws are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by courts 
it is often difficult to predict how these laws will be applied  and they potentially subject many typical business arrangements to government investigation and prosecution  which can be costly and time consuming 
violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from participation in government sponsored health care programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws 
some states also have similar anti kickback and self referral laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
if our business practices are found to violate any of these provisions  we may be unable to continue with our relationships or implement our business plans  which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to healthcare anti fraud initiatives  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers  taking an expansive definition of fraud that includes receiving fees in connection with a healthcare business that is found to violate any of the complex regulations described above 
while to our knowledge we have not been the subject of any anti fraud investigations  if such a claim were made defending our business practices could be time consuming and expensive  and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations  which we may not be able to do successfully 
our use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy and security regulations  which may result in increased costs in conducting research or providing administrative services to healthcare providers in connection with the use of our protocols  we may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and related rules 
the three rules that were promulgated pursuant to hipaa that could most significantly affect our business are the standards for electronic transactions  or transactions rule  the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy rule  and the health insurance reform security standards  or security rule 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare facilities and health plans that will contract for the use of our protocols and our services 
the hipaa rules require covered entities to bind contractors like us to compliance with certain burdensome hipaa rule requirements 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient information also apply to our licensees directly and to us  either directly or indirectly 
the hipaa transactions rule establishes format and data content standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions 
when we perform billing and collection services on behalf of our licensees we may be engaging in one of more of these standard transactions and will be required to conduct those transactions in compliance with the required standards 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  requires entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa rule requirements that are imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the ftc and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient information  through web sites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of web site content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of personal and patient information 
these laws in many cases are not preempted by the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our licensees and potentially exposing us 
table of contents to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
we may not be able to profitably adapt to the changing healthcare and substance dependence treatment industry  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity healthcare organizations  public and private  continue to change the manner in which they operate and pay for services 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures  among other things 
we cannot predict the likelihood of all future changes in the healthcare industry in general  or the substance dependence treatment industry in particular  or what impact they may have on our earnings  financial condition or business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be subject to substantial volatility  and you may lose all or a substantial part of your investment our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
over the last year  it traded between and per share on limited and sporadic volume ranging from approximately  to  shares per day 
as a result  the current price for our common stock on the nasdaq is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our fair market value 
the price at which our common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the number of shares available for sale in the market  quarterly variations in our operating results  actual or anticipated announcements of new data  studies  products or services by us or competitors  regulatory investigations or determinations  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  recruitment or departures of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance  market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole

as a result  mr 
peizer presently and is expected to continue to have the ability to substantially influence the election of our board of directors and the outcome of all other issues submitted to our stockholders 
the interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and it may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
one consequence to this substantial stockholder s interest is that it may be difficult for investors to remove management of the company 
it could also deter unsolicited takeovers  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could discourage a change in control  and adversely affect existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue one or more series of preferred stock  which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock 
delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with interested stockholders 
these provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
these provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests
