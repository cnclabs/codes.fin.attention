overview founded in  tsfg is a financial holding company that operates primarily in select markets in the southeast area of the united states 
tsfg had billion in total assets with branch offices in south carolina  florida  and north carolina at december  tsfg operates primarily through two subsidiary banks carolina first bank  the largest south carolina headquartered commercial bank  operating in south carolina and north carolina  and on the internet under the brand name  bank caroline  and mercantile bank  a florida headquartered bank  operating in florida 
tsfg uses a super community bank strategy serving small and middle market businesses and retail customers 
as a super community bank  tsfg combines personalized customer service and local decision making  typical of community banks  with a full range of financial services normally found at larger regional institutions 
tsfg focuses on fast growing banking markets in the southeast  concentrating its growth in metropolitan statistical areas 
during  tsfg continued to expand in its southeastern markets 
in may  tsfg acquired pointe financial corporation pointe  headquartered in boca raton  florida  which had approximately million in assets 
in addition  tsfg acquired three florida based insurance financial planning agencies  opened ten de novo branches  and closed two branches 
for  net income totaled million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for during  in response to the flattening yield curve and lower profitability of our investment securities  we elected to reduce our holdings of investment securities and the associated level of wholesale funding 
this balance sheet repositioning contributed to a million loss on the sale of investment securities and a million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in addition  net income included a loss of million on trading and derivative activities compared to a gain on trading and derivative activities of million  and million in employment contract buyouts 
for  average diluted shares outstanding increased  principally as a result of the july acquisitions of cnb florida bancshares  inc cnb florida and florida banks  inc 
florida banks and the may acquisition of pointe 
the above mentioned results for are different from what tsfg reported in its january  earnings release  in which tsfg reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
the difference of  equals of net income for and relates to additional contract buy out accruals for early retirement benefits under the supplementary executive retirement plans 
during  tsfg significantly reduced its level of investment securities and wholesale borrowings 
investment securities declined to billion at december  from billion at december  tsfg also reduced wholesale borrowings to billion at december  from billion a year earlier 
at december   tsfg s securities to total assets ratio declined to of total assets  down from at december  tsfg s ratio of wholesale borrowings to total assets declined to at december   down from at december  using period end balances  our loan and customer deposit balances grew in as follows total loans held for investment increased  or excluding the impact of loans acquired through mergers  and 
table of contents customer deposits total deposits less brokered deposits increased  or excluding the impact of deposits acquired through mergers 
tsfg increased its emphasis on customer deposit growth during in an effort to reduce its reliance on wholesale borrowings 
in  in contrast to prior years  deposit growth substantially funded all of our loan growth 
in addition  our loan yields grew faster than the cost of customer deposits 
for  net interest income  tsfg s primary source of revenue  accounted for of total revenues compared to for net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets  primarily loans and securities  and the interest paid for liabilities to support such assets  primarily deposits and borrowed funds 
tax equivalent net interest income was million in  a increase over million in this increase was primarily the result of a increase in average earning assets  driven by a increase in average loans including growth from acquisitions 
the net interest margin totaled for and for noninterest income decreased to million for from million for  down 
the decrease was driven primarily by a loss of million on the sale of available for sale securities in  compared to a gain of million in additionally  the change in fair value of interest rate swaps resulted in a loss of million in  compared to a gain of million for the net cash settlement of interest rate swaps which did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment declined to million in from million in as a result of the increase in short term interest rates during the period 
if the impact of these net cash settlements were included in the net interest margin rather than in noninterest income  the tax equivalent net interest margin would have declined to for from for gains on trading and certain other derivative activities decreased to a loss of  in from a gain of million in for  noninterest income included a million other than temporary impairment of federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation perpetual preferred stock  and a million gain on disposition of land associated with a conservation grant 
customer fee income service charges on deposit accounts  debit card income  and customer service fee income  wealth management income  bank owned life insurance  merchant processing income  and mortgage banking income  the primary operating components of noninterest income  increased to million in from million in noninterest expenses totaled million in compared to million for  an increase of 
salaries and wages and employee benefits  which account for of the total noninterest expenses for  increased  growing to million in from million in the increase in personnel expense was primarily attributable to the pointe acquisition  higher branch and lending incentives  higher incentives and commissions relating to fee based businesses  higher discretionary incentives under tsfg s short term plan  pay increases  higher health insurance costs  higher contract buyouts  and additional employees 
occupancy costs increased for primarily due to growth initiatives and acquisitions 
professional services increased by due to outsourcing certain internal audit functions during the year as well as other outsourced professional services 
these fees are expected to decline for noninterest expenses also include a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in compared to million in this loss for was incurred in connection with the repositioning of the balance sheet discussed earlier 
at december   nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans held for investment and foreclosed property declined to from at december  net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans held for investment totaled for  down from for tsfg s provision for credit losses increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of the increased provision associated with the loan growth 
tsfg s tangible equity to tangible asset ratio decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to an increase in the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates tsfg s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry 
tsfg makes a number of judgmental estimates and assumptions relating to reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during periods presented 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments  the accounting for derivatives and other hedging activities  the fair value of certain financial instruments securities  derivatives  and privately held investments  income tax assets or liabilities  and accounting for acquisitions  including the fair value determinations  the analysis of goodwill impairment and the analysis of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired 

table of contents to a lesser extent  significant estimates are also associated with the determination of contingent liabilities  stock based and discretionary compensation  and other employee benefit agreements 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in tsfg s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain determinations inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
tsfg has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgements 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the allowance for loan losses allowance represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses in the lending portfolio 
see balance sheet review allowance for loan losses for additional discussion  including the methodology for analyzing the adequacy of the allowance 
this methodology relies upon management s judgment in segregating the portfolio into risk similar segments  computing specific allocations for impaired loans  and setting the amounts within the probable loss range from to of the adjusted historical loss ratio 
management s judgments evolve from an assessment of various issues  including but not limited to the pace of loan growth  collateral values  borrower s ability and willingness to repay  emerging portfolio concentrations  risk management system  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about current events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of tsfg 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require tsfg to adjust its allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the methodology used to determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments  which is included in other liabilities  is inherently similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses described above  adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments  including the probability of funding and historical loss ratio 
derivatives and hedging activities tsfg uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of hedge accounting requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similarly hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivatives and related hedged items 
tsfg believes that its methods for addressing these judgmental areas are reasonable and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
see derivative financial instruments and fair value of certain financial instruments for additional information regarding derivatives 
fair value of certain financial instruments fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be liquidated in a transaction between willing  unrelated parties in a normal business transaction 
fair value is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments  adjusted for any differences in terms 
if market values are not readily available  then the fair value is estimated 
for example  when tsfg has an investment in a privately held company  tsfg s management evaluates the fair value of these investments based on the entity s ability to generate cash through its operations  obtain alternative financing  and subjective factors 
modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses  which use assumptions for interest rates  credit losses  prepayments  and discount rates  are also used to estimate fair value if market values are not readily available for certain financial instruments 
tsfg carries its available for sale securities  trading securities  and derivatives at fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses  
table of contents net of income tax effect  on available for sale securities and derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
the fair value adjustments for trading securities and derivative financial instruments not qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in earnings 
in addition  for hedged items in a fair value hedge  changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk are also included in noninterest income 
no fair value adjustment is allowed for the related hedged asset or liability in circumstances where the derivatives do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
tsfg periodically evaluates its investment securities portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
if a security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  the related unrealized loss is charged to operations and a new cost basis is established 
factors considered include the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to period end  and forecasted performance of the security issuer 
impairment is considered other than temporary unless the holder of the security has both the intent and ability to hold the security until the fair value recovers and evidence supporting the recovery outweighs evidence to the contrary 
however  for equity securities  which typically do not have a contractual maturity with a specified cash flow on which to rely  the ability to hold an equity security indefinitely  by itself  does not allow for avoidance of other than temporary impairment 
the market values of tsfg s investments in privately held limited partnerships  corporations and llcs are not readily available 
these investments are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method of accounting 
the accounting treatment depends upon tsfg s percentage ownership and degree of management influence 
tsfg s management evaluates its investments in limited partnerships and llcs quarterly for impairment based on the investee s ability to generate cash through its operations  obtain alternative financing  and subjective factors 
there are inherent risks associated with tsfg s investments in privately held limited partnerships  corporations and llcs  which may result in income statement volatility in future periods 
the process for valuing financial instruments  particularly those with little or no liquidity  is subjective and involves a high degree of judgment 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
valuations are subject to change as a result of external factors beyond our control that have a substantial degree of uncertainty 
the inherent risks associated with determining the fair value of a financial instrument may result in income statement volatility in future periods 
income taxes management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the us tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service irs 
tsfg is subject to potential adverse adjustments  including but not limited to an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
during the third quarter  the internal revenue service completed its examination of tsfg s through federal income tax returns 
tsfg did not receive any adverse rulings or additional tax assessments as a result of these examinations 
the irs is currently reviewing tsfg s income tax returns 
accounting for acquisitions tsfg has grown its operations  in part  through bank and non bank acquisitions 
since  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  tsfg has used the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions 
under this method  tsfg is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal  or other valuation techniques 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals for planned facilities dispositions and employee benefit related considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions 
table of contents typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to periodic impairment tests  on an annual basis  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
these tests  which tsfg performed annually as of june th since  use estimates such as projected cash flows  discount rates  time periods  and comparable market values in their calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as well as the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
tsfg uses a third party to test for goodwill impairment by determining the fair value for each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the potential for impairment exists  and a second step of impairment testing is required 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
if the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its fair value 
the valuations as of june  indicated that no impairment charges were required as of that test date 
there have been no events or circumstances since june  that indicate there may be potential impairment 
for several previous acquisitions  tsfg has agreed to issue earn out payments based on the achievement of certain performance targets 
upon paying the additional consideration  tsfg would record additional goodwill 
tsfg s other intangible assets have an estimated finite useful life and are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset 
tsfg periodically reviews its other intangible assets to determine whether there have been any events or circumstances which indicate the recorded amount is not recoverable from projected undiscounted cash flows 
if the projected undiscounted net operating cash flows are less than the carrying amount  a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value  and when appropriate  the amortization period is also reduced

credit quality a willingness to take credit risk is inherent in the decision to grant credit 
prudent risk taking requires a credit risk management system based on sound policies and control processes that ensure compliance with those policies 
tsfg s credit risk management system is defined by policies approved by the board of directors that govern the risk underwriting  portfolio monitoring  and problem loan administration processes 
adherence to underwriting standards is managed through a multi layered credit approval process and after the fact review by credit risk management of loans approved by lenders 
through daily review by credit risk managers  monthly reviews of exception reports  and ongoing analysis of asset quality trends  compliance with underwriting and loan monitoring policies is closely supervised 
the administration of problem loans is driven by policies that require written plans for resolution and quarterly meetings with credit risk management to review progress

table of contents adequacy is defined as a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date presented 
the methodology employed for this analysis is as follows 
the portfolio is segregated into risk similar segments for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type for consumer loans direct installment  indirect installment  revolving  and mortgage and by credit risk grade for performing commercial loans 
nonperforming commercial loans are reviewed for impairment and impairment is measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas  and assigned specific allocations 
to allow for modeling error  a range of probable loss ratios from to of the adjusted historical loss ratio is then derived for each segment 
the resulting percentages are then applied to the dollar amounts of loans in each segment to arrive at each segment s range of probable loss levels 
the allowance for each portfolio segment is set at an amount within its range that reflects management s best judgment of the extent to which historical loss levels are more or less accurate indicators of current losses in the portfolio 
management s judgments evolve from an assessment of various issues  including but not limited to the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  risk management system changes  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loans acquired from acquisitions  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
the allowance is then segregated into allocated and unallocated components 
the allocated component is the sum of the loss estimates at the lower end of the probable loss range for each category 
the unallocated component is the sum of the amounts by which final loss estimates exceed the lower end estimates for each category 
the unallocated component of the allowance represents probable incurred losses in the portfolio based on our analysis that are not fully captured in the allocated component 
allocation of the allowance to respective loan portfolio components is not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations 
the entire allowance is available to absorb incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of tsfg 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance declined as a percentage of loans held for investment to at december  from at december  this decline was primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual and impaired loans  and the related specific allowance 
the allowance coverage increased to times nonperforming loans at december  from times at december  see credit quality 
table  which summarizes the changes in the allowance  and table  which reflects the allocation of the allowance at the end of each year  provides additional information with respect to the activity in the allowance

in addition to the allowance for loan losses  tsfg also estimates probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments 
the methodology to determine such losses is inherently similar to the methodology utilized in calculating the allowance for commercial loans  adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments  including the probability of funding 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made by changes to the provision for credit losses 

table of contents securities tsfg uses the investment securities portfolio for several purposes 
it serves as a vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk  to generate interest and dividend income from the investment of funds  to provide liquidity to meet funding requirements  and to provide collateral for pledges on public deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and federal home loan bank borrowings 
in addition  tsfg has engaged in  and expects to continue to engage in  hedging activities designed to reduce interest rate risk associated with the investment securities and other balance sheet items

during the first quarter of  additional securities of approximately million were purchased  funded with additional leverage from wholesale borrowings 
during the remaining three quarters of  tsfg reduced its securities by approximately billion in an effort to lower its interest rate risk in a rising rate and flattening yield curve environment and to reduce its reliance on wholesale borrowings 
at december   tsfg had a securities to total asset ratio of  down from at december  the average tax equivalent portfolio yield increased in to from in the securities yield increased primarily due to a million decrease in mortgage backed securities mbs premium amortization for compared to tsfg strives to keep the duration of its securities portfolio relatively short to provide adequate flexibility to proactively manage cash flow as market conditions change 
cash flow may be used to pay off borrowings  to fund loan growth  or to reinvest 
table of contents in securities at then current market rates 
the expected duration of the debt securities portfolio increased to approximately years at december  from approximately years at december  the increase was due to the impact of rising interest rates 
if interest rates continue to rise  the duration of the debt securities portfolio may extend 
the available for sale portfolio constituted of total securities at december  management believes that maintaining most of its securities in the available for sale category provides greater flexibility in the management of the overall investment portfolio 
nearly all of these securities are rated aaa so the credit risk is minimal 
approximately of mbs are collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with a total expected duration of years 
tsfg manages the mbs portfolio to maintain a short duration and repricing horizon 
at december   approximately of the mbs portfolio was variable rate or hybrid variable rate  where the rate adjusts on an annual basis after a specified fixed rate period  generally ranging from three to ten years 
many of these adjustable rate mbs are still in the fixed rate period  and are therefore anticipated to behave more like a fixed rate instrument over the next twelve months or more 
changes in interest rates and related prepayment activity impact yields and fair values of tsfg s securities  specifically mbs 
based on the current investment portfolio composition  in a rising interest rate environment  related prepayment activity should decrease 
decreasing prepayment activity extends the premium amortization period  thereby improving yields 
the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities pre tax totaled million at december   compared with a million loss at december  this increase in unrealized loss was primarily due to increases in interest rates  with the most significant increase in unrealized loss relating to mbs  which increased million 
if interest rates continue to increase  tsfg expects its net unrealized loss on available for sale securities as a percentage of the portfolio to increase 
see item  note to the consolidated financial statements for information about tsfg s securities in unrealized loss positions

tsfg offers programs that permit its customers to hedge various risks  including fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
through these programs  derivative contracts are executed between the customers and tsfg 
offsetting contracts are executed between tsfg and selected third parties to hedge the risk created through the customer contracts 
the third party interest rate contracts are identical to the customer contracts  except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to tsfg as compensation for administrative costs  credit risk and profit 
as a result  the change in fair value of the customer contracts will generally be offset by the change in fair value of the related third party contracts 
these customer contracts generally take the form of interest rate swaps to hedge fixed rate loans made by tsfg to the customer and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with non dollar denominated transactions 
all derivative contracts associated with these programs are carried at fair value and are not considered hedges under sfas at december   the largest fair value adjustment to any single customer or counterparty totaled  fair value hedges

tsfg terminated the interest rate swaps hedging the subordinated debt in november trading 
from time to time  tsfg enters into derivative financial contracts that are not designed to hedge specific transactions or identified assets or liabilities and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting  but are rather part of the company s overall risk management strategy 
such contracts include interest rate futures  option contracts on certain us agency debt securities  and certain other interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedges 
the futures contracts are exchange traded  while the option contracts are over the counter instruments with money center and super regional financial institution counterparties 
these contracts are marked to market through earnings each period and are generally short term in nature 
at december  there were no such contracts outstanding 
for the year ended december   tsfg recognized a gain of  relating to these activities  compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  mortgage loan commitments and forward sales commitments 
as part of its mortgage lending activities  tsfg originates certain residential loans and commits these loans for sale 
the commitments to originate residential loans rate locks and the sales commitments are freestanding derivative instruments and are generally funded within days 
during the third quarter  tsfg expanded its strategy to include selling mortgage loans on a pooled basis in addition to individual loan sales 
as a result  the amount of time between origination date and sale date has increased  which has increased the amount of interest rate risk associated with these loans 
at december   the fair value of the rate locks was a liability of  the company enters into forward sales commitments of closed mortgage loans to third parties at a specified price 
the forward sales commitments are entered into to economically hedge the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loans 
the change in the value of the forward sales commitments is recognized through current period earnings 
the loans are accounted for on the basis of the lower of cost or market guidelines 
fair value hedging gains or losses related to the forward sales commitments were not material for the year ended december  the fair value of forward sales commitments was an asset of  and a liability of  at december  credit risk of derivative financial instruments 
entering into derivative financial contracts creates credit risk for potential amounts contractually due to tsfg from the derivative counterparties 
derivative credit risk is generally measured as the net replacement cost to tsfg in the event that a counterparty to a contract in a gain position to tsfg completely fails to perform under the terms of the contract 
derivative credit risk related to existing bank customers in the case of customer loan swaps and foreign exchange contracts is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures 
the effects of changes in interest 
table of contents rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible options to limit the maximum exposures to individual customers 
customer loan swaps are generally cross collateralized with the related loan 
in addition  customers may also be required to provide margin collateral to further limit tsfg s derivative credit risk 
counterparty credit risk with other derivative counterparties generally money center and super regional financial institutions is evaluated through existing policies and procedures 
this evaluation considers the total relationship between tsfg and each of the counterparties 
individual limits are established by management and approved by the credit department 
margin collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities is required if the exposure between tsfg and any counterparty exceeds established limits 
based on declines in the counterparties credit rating  these limits are reduced and additional margin collateral is required 
a deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the counterparties to these contracts may result in the related hedging relationships being deemed ineffective or in tsfg not achieving its desired economic hedging outcome 
this could occur if the credit standing of the counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supported the contract or the counterparty s ability to provide margin collateral was impaired
