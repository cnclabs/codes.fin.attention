overview as a financial institution with a focus on traditional banking activities  the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans or investments 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes 

table of contents the corporation s net income for increased million  or  from million in to million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in to per share in in  the corporation realized a return on average assets of and a return on average tangible equity of  compared to and  respectively  in net income for increased million  or  from million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in in  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

for the year ended december   net income and diluted net income per share were reduced by million and  respectively 
see note m  stock based compensation plans and shareholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of adopting statement r and its effect on prior periods 
the increase in earnings was driven by a million  or  increase in net interest income due to both internal and external growth and a year over year increase in net interest margin 
also contributing to the increase in earnings was a million  or  increase in other income excluding securities gains  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
these items were offset by a million  or  increase in other expenses  also primarily due to recent acquisitions  and an million  or  reduction in investment securities gains 
the following summarizes some of the more significant factors that influenced the corporation s results 
interest rates changes in the interest rate environment generally impact both the corporation s net interest income and its non interest income 
the interest rate environment reflects both the level of short term rates and the slope of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve  which plots the yields on treasury issues over various maturity periods 
during the past year  the yield curve has flattened  with short term rates increasing at a faster pace than longer term rates 
floating rate loans  short term borrowings and savings and time deposit rates are generally influenced by short term rates 
during  the federal reserve board frb raised the federal funds rate eight times  for a total increase of basis points since december   with the overnight borrowing  or federal funds  rate ending the year at 
the corporation s prime lending rate had a corresponding increase  from to 
the increase in short term rates benefited the corporation during the first half of as floating rate loans quickly adjusted to higher rates  while increases in deposit rates which are more discretionary were less pronounced 
throughout the remainder of the year  competitive pressures resulted in increases in deposit rates 
while the net interest margin for the year increased over the prior year  during it was flat  which is shown in the following table st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year to date with respect to longer term rates  the year treasury yield  which is a common benchmark for evaluating residential mortgage rates  increased to at december  as compared to at december  mortgage rates have been historically low over the past several years  generating strong refinance activity and significant gains for the corporation as fixed rate residential mortgages are generally sold in the secondary market 
with only a minimal increase in long term rates from the prior year  origination volumes and the resulting gains on sales of these loans remained strong  continuing to contribute to the corporation s non interest income 
if rates continue to rise and the yield curve steepens  residential mortgage volume could decrease  resulting in a negative impact on non interest income  as gains on sale would decline 
the market risk section of management s discussion summarizes the expected impact of rate changes on net interest income 

table of contents earning assets the corporation s interest earning assets increased from to as a result of acquisitions  as well as internal loan growth 
this growth also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
from to  the corporation experienced a shift in its composition of interest earning assets from investments of total average interest earning assets in  compared to in to loans in  compared to in 
this change resulted from strong loan demand being partially funded with the proceeds from maturing investment securities 
the movement to higher yielding loans has had a positive effect on the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin 
asset quality asset quality refers to the underlying credit characteristics of borrowers and the likelihood that defaults on contractual loan payments will result in charge offs of account balances 
asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  but can be managed through conservative underwriting and sound collection policies and procedures 
the corporation has been able to maintain strong asset quality through different economic cycles  attributable to its credit culture and underwriting policies 
this trend continued in as net charge offs to average loans decreased from in to in non performing assets to total assets increased to at december   from at december   however  this level is still relatively low in absolute terms 
while overall asset quality has remained strong  deterioration in quality of one or several significant accounts could have a detrimental impact and result in losses that may not be foreseeable based on current information 
in addition  rising interest rates could increase the total payments of borrowers and could have a negative impact on their ability to pay according to the terms of their loans 
equity markets as disclosed in the market risk section of management s discussion  equity valuations can have an impact on the corporation s financial performance 
in particular  bank stocks account for a significant portion of the corporation s equity investment portfolio 
historically  gains on sales of these equities have been a recurring component of the corporation s earnings  although realized gains have decreased in recent quarters 
declines in bank stock portfolio values could have a detrimental impact on the corporation s ability to recognize gains in the future 
acquisitions in july  the corporation acquired svb financial services  inc svb of somerville  new jersey  a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was somerset valley bank 
in december  the corporation acquired first washington financialcorp first washington  of windsor  new jersey  a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was first washington state bank 
in april  the corporation acquired resource bankshares corporation resource  an million financial holding company located in virginia beach  virginia whose primary subsidiary was resource bank 
this was the corporation s first acquisition in virginia  allowing it to enter a new geographic market 
period to period comparisons in the results of operations section of management s discussion are impacted by these acquisitions when results are compared to results for in comparison to were impacted by the acquisitions of first washington  resource and premier bancorp  inc in august the discussion and tables within the results of operations section of management s discussion highlight the contributions of these acquisitions in addition to internal changes 
on february   the corporation completed its acquisition of columbia bancorp columbia  of columbia  maryland 
columbia was a billion bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was the columbia bank  which operates full service community banking offices and five retirement community offices in howard  montgomery  prince george s and baltimore counties and baltimore city 
for additional information on the terms of these acquisitions  see note q  mergers and acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions have long been a supplement to the corporation s internal growth  providing the opportunity for the corporation s existing products and services to be sold in new markets 
the corporation s acquisition strategy focuses on high growth areas with strong market demographics and targets organizations that have a comparable corporate culture  strong performance and good asset quality  among other factors 
under its supercommunity banking philosophy  acquired organizations generally retain their status as separate legal entities  unless consolidation with an existing affiliate bank is practical 
back office functions are generally consolidated to maximize efficiencies 
merger and acquisition activity in the financial services industry has been very competitive in recent years  as evidenced by the prices paid for certain acquisitions 
while the corporation has been an active acquirer  management is committed to basing its pricing on rational economic models 
management will continue to focus on generating growth in the most cost effective manner 

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s net income  accounting for approximately of total revenues  excluding investment securities gains 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate and economic environments is important to the success of a financial institution 
growth in net interest income is generally dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or growing the net interest margin 
the market risk section of management s discussion provides additional information on the policies and procedures used by the corporation to manage net interest income

during  proceeds from investment maturities were used to fund loan growth  however during the corporation s purchases of new investment securities exceeded proceeds from sales and maturities 
the average yield on investment securities improved basis points from in to in this improvement was due partially to premium amortization decreasing  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income  from million in to million in as prepayments on mortgage backed securities decreased

this increase was partially offset by the million decrease in interest income that resulted from the decline in average yields earned 
average loans increased by billion  or  to billion in acquisitions contributed approximately million to this increase in average balances 
loan growth was strong in the commercial and commercial mortgage categories 
the growth experienced in the commercial agricultural category resulted from an agricultural loan portfolio purchased in december the reduction in mortgage loan balances was due to customer refinance activity that occurred during the corporation generally sells newly originated fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market to promote liquidity and manage interest rate risk 
home equity loans increased significantly due to promotional efforts and customers using home equity loans as a cost effective refinance alternative 
consumer loans decreased  reflecting customers repayment of these loans with tax advantaged residential mortgage or home equity loans

average investments decreased slightly during  however  without the impact of acquisitions  the investment balances would have decreased million  or 
the corporation s investment balances had increased over the last few years due to both significant deposit growth and the use of limited strategies to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
during  the corporation did not reinvest a significant portion of investment maturities in order to minimize interest rate risk in expectation of a rising rate environment and to help fund loan growth 
the average yield on investment securities declined slightly from in to in premium amortization  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income  was million in compared to million in the benefit from the lower premium amortization was offset by the reduction in stated yields experienced throughout interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in  mainly as a result of a billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities  which included approximately million added by acquisitions

table of contents decrease due to the basis point decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points  or  from in to in this reduction was due to both the impact of declining short term interest rates in the first half of and the continuing shifts in the composition of deposits from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits

acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase in average deposit balances 
average borrowings increased significantly during  with average short term borrowings increasing million  or  to billion  and average long term debt increasing million  or  to million 
acquisitions added million to the short term borrowings increase and million to the long term debt increase

table of contents the following table presents the aggregate amount of non accrual and past due loans and other real estate owned december in thousands non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more other real estate totals as of december   the additional interest income that would have been recorded during if non accrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on non accrual loans that was included in income was approximately million 
accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current or the loan is considered secured and in the process of collection 
certain loans  primarily residential mortgages  that are determined to be sufficiently collateralized may continue to accrue interest after reaching days past due 
excluded from the amounts presented at december  are million in loans where possible credit problems of borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
these loans are considered to be impaired under statement  but continue to pay according to their contractual terms and are therefore not included in non performing loans 
non accrual loans include million of impaired loans

net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  a two basis point decrease from in  which was an basis point decrease from total net charge offs of million in and million in approximated the amounts recorded for the provision for loan losses in those years 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased slightly from at december  to at december   after decreasing three basis points in while the non performing assets ratio increased eight basis points in comparison to  the level of non performing assets was still relatively low in absolute terms 
the provision for loan losses is determined by the allowance allocation process  whereby an estimated need is allocated to impaired loans as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  or to pools of loans under 
table of contents statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allocation is based on risk factors  collateral levels  economic conditions and other relevant factors  as appropriate 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance  which was approximately at december  the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions that might exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable 
management believes such an unallocated allowance is reasonable and appropriate as the estimates used in the allocation process are inherently imprecise 
see additional disclosures in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies  in management s discussion 
management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

the corporation periodically implements stock repurchase plans for various corporate purposes 
in addition to evaluating the financial benefits of implementing repurchase plans  management also considers liquidity needs  the current market price per share and regulatory limitations 
in  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan for million shares  which was extended through june  during  million shares were repurchased under this plan 
on june   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan for million shares through december  during  million shares were repurchased under this plan  including million shares acquired under an accelerated share repurchase program asr 
on december   the board of directors extended the stock repurchase plan through june  and increased the total number of shares that could be repurchased to million 
no shares were purchased under this extended plan in during  million shares were repurchased under this plan through an asr 
under an asr  the corporation repurchases shares immediately from an investment bank rather than over time 
the investment bank  in turn  repurchases shares on the open market over a period that is determined by the average daily trading volume of the corporation s shares  among other factors 
for the asr in effect at december   which was implemented in the second quarter of  the corporation settled its position with the investment bank at the termination of the asr by paying cash in an amount representing the difference between the initial prices paid and the actual price of the shares repurchased 
the corporation completed the asr in february of  and paid the investment bank a total of million for this difference 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that are fixed and determinable at december  payments due in one year one to three to over five or less three years five years years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity a time deposits b short term borrowings c long term debt c operating leases d purchase obligations e a includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time

e includes significant information technology  telecommunication and data processing outsourcing contracts 
variable obligations  such as those based on transaction volumes  are not included 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance and provision for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the provision is the periodic charge to earnings  which is necessary to adjust the allowance to its proper balance 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are rated less than satisfactory based upon the corporation s internal credit rating process 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans identified as impaired  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies statement 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
accounting for business combinations the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires assessing the existence of and  if necessary  assigning a value to certain intangible assets 
the remaining excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price is established as the value of securities issued for the acquisition  cash consideration paid and certain acquisition related expenses 
the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are typically established through appraisals  observable market values or discounted cash flows 
management has engaged independent third party valuation experts to assist in valuing certain assets  particularly intangibles 
other assets and liabilities are generally valued using the corporation s internal asset liability modeling system 
the assumptions used and the final valuations  whether prepared internally or by a third party  are reviewed by management 
due to the complexity of purchase 
table of contents accounting  final determinations of values can be time consuming and  occasionally  amounts included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income are based on preliminary estimates of value 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense in the consolidated income statement 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during  and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an impairment test between annual tests is necessary 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
the corporation has not performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the past three years as no such events have occurred 
however  such an interim test could be necessary in the future 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are not likely to be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for deferred tax assets as of december   except in the case of deferred tax benefits related to state income tax net operating losses 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of recently issued accounting standards adopted by the corporation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions  us government sponsored agency stocks and money market mutual funds 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of million at december  gross unrealized gains in this portfolio were approximately million at december  although the carrying value of the financial institutions stocks accounted only for of the corporation s total assets  any unrealized gains in the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline more significantly than the current year  this revenue could materially be impacted 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
the corporation has evaluated  based on existing accounting guidance  whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of  in   in and million in for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
through december   gains of approximately million had been realized on the sale of investments previously written down and  as of december   the impaired securities still held in the portfolio had recovered approximately  of the original write down amount 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the risk of changes in the value of its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities markets contract  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation s sources and uses of cash were discussed in general terms in the overview section of management s discussion 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million  compared to a net cash inflow of 
table of contents million in in  reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio and the net increase in the loan portfolio exceeded proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities 
in  funds provided by investment maturities and sales of investment securities were greater than the reinvestments in investment securities and the net increase in the loan portfolio 
financing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in  compared to a net cash usage of million in as net funds were provided by increases in deposits  primarily time deposits as a result of increasing rates  as well as short term borrowings and long term debt 
in  funds provided by maturing investments were used to reduce short term borrowings 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
prior to  the parent company had been able to meet its cash needs through normal  allowable dividends and loans 
however  as a result of increased acquisition activity and stock repurchase plans  the parent company s cash needs increased  requiring additional sources of funds 
in  the corporation issued million of ten year subordinated notes  which mature april  and carry a fixed rate of 
interest is paid semi annually  commencing in october in  the parent company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with an unaffiliated bank 
under the terms of the agreement  the parent company can borrow up to million with interest calculated at the one month london interbank offering rate libor plus 
the credit agreement requires the corporation to maintain certain financial ratios related to capital strength and earnings 
as of december  there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the corporation was in compliance with all required covenants under the credit agreement as of december  in january  the corporation purchased all of the common stock of a new delaware business trust  fulton capital trust i  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities at an effective rate of approximately 
in connection with this transaction the parent company issued million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the trust 
these debentures carry the same rate and mature on february  these borrowings  most notably the revolving line of credit agreement  supplement the liquidity available from subsidiaries through dividends and provide some flexibility in parent company cash management 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
in addition to its normal recurring and operating cash needs  the parent company also paid cash for a portion of the columbia bancorp acquisition  which was completed on february  based on the terms of the merger agreement  the parent company paid approximately million in cash to consummate the acquisition 
for further details  see note q  mergers and acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets  at december  
table of contents the following tables present the maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal totals mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal other securities totals mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of percent 
maturities for mortgage backed securities are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans  and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the corporation invests primarily in five and seven year balloon mortgage backed securities to limit interest rate risk and promote liquidity

even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
in addition  the corporation issues certificates of deposits in various denominations  including jumbo time deposits  and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity

floating rate loans include adjustable rate commercial mortgages 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
fair market value adjustments related to acquisitions are not included in the preceding table 
in addition to the interest rate sensitive instruments included in the preceding table  the corporation also had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million as of december  these swaps were used to hedge certain long term fixed rate certificates of deposit 
the terms of the certificates of deposit and the interest rate swaps mirror each other and were committed to simultaneously 
under the terms of the agreements  the corporation is the fixed rate receiver and the floating rate payer generally tied to the three month london interbank offering rate  or libor  a common index used for setting rates between financial institutions 
the combination of the interest rate swaps and the issuance of the certificates of deposit generates long term floating rate funding for the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s weighted average receive and pay rates were and  respectively 

table of contents the corporation entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million in october in anticipation of the january issuance of trust preferred securities 
this was accounted for as a cash flow hedge as it hedges the variability of interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt 
the total amount paid in january as settlement of the forward starting interest rate swap was million 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having non contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans and for mortgage backed securities includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets 
the cumulative six month gap as of december  was negative 
the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl as of december  was 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for six and twelve month intervals as of december  twelve six months months cumulative rsa rsl cumulative gap of earning assets simulation of net interest income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of short term interest rates with changes across the yield curve based upon industry projections 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income annual change in net interest rate shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement
