overview our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
at october   we have manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada and holland 
we manufacture plastic films  principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
during fiscal  resin costs  which varies by the product line  averaged of the cost of goods sold 
since resin costs fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should  therefore  result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins  and thus in both cases with no impact on gross profit 
average resin pricing increased during fiscal in north america and in europe 
in north america and in europe  we were able to pass through the current and prior year s resin price increases in fiscal there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to pass on resin price increases on a penny for penny basis in the future if prices were to increase 
we anticipate that resin prices during fiscal will decrease as fuel prices decline and as production from petrochemical companies normalize after recovering from the effects of the gulf coast hurricanes

these positive adjustments were offset by increases in accounts receivable of million resulting from higher dollar and volume sales in the month of october the remaining net changes in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity for the twelve month period 
net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended october   was million  resulting primarily from cash proceeds received from the sale of our pacific and termofilm operations of million 
in addition  we received million from the sale of machinery in fiap and million from the sale of other machinery and equipment from continuing operations 
these positive influxes of cash were offset by investments in capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended october   was million  reflecting the purchase of our notes for million including the tender and redemption fees of million  payment of million of fees related to the issuance of our notes and million of fees paid related to the amendment of our credit facility  million of capitalized lease payments  net repayments of our credit facility and our pennsylvania industrial loans of million and a increase in restricted cash

future cash flows our aggregate commitments under our credit facility  senior notes  industrial loans  foreign borrowings  interest on fixed rate borrowings  capital leases and noncancelable operating lease agreements as of october   are as follows for the fiscal years ending october  borrowings interest on fixed rate borrowings capital leases operating leases total commitment in thousands thereafter borrowings include million senior notes due on march  on may   we entered into an agreement for the sale of our land and buildings in fiap for approximately million 
a million deposit was received on signing of the agreement and the remaining million was collected upon closing on january  we expect to use approximately  of cash for the final payouts of the non compete agreements and final liquidation costs in fiap during fiscal the liquidation of spain is expected to be completed in fiscal with expenses of approximately million to be paid related to the salaries of the remaining two personnel  professional fees and utilities offset by cash inflow of million from the receipt of the final installment payment related to the sale of the machinery 
the net million along with the million currently held in the spanish banks will be used to settle final creditor balances  including us intercompany loans 
we know of no current or pending demands or commitments that will materially affect liquidity  however we have million in approved capital project spending that is scheduled to be incurred over the next twelve months 
we had approximately million of unfunded pension benefit obligations at october   related to our canadian and holland operations 
we expect to contribute a total of approximately million related to these foreign defined benefit plans during fiscal we believe that our cash on hand at october   and our cash flow from operations  assuming no material adverse change  combined with the availability of funds under our credit facility and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
at october   we had an aggregate of approximately million available under our worldwide credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
effects of inflation inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
contingencies in fiscal  the european commission served our holland subsidiary with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by the subsidiary 
we have cooperated with the european commission in its investigation 
our last written communication with the european commission was in january at this time  no litigation is pending against us or our subsidiary involving this matter  and we are not in a position to evaluate the outcome of this investigation 
however  there can be no assurance that in the event that the european commission serves a statement of objections instituting a proceeding against our holland subsidiary which results in a fine being assessed  that the amount of the fine would not be material 
in february  our new zealand subsidiary  was served with two summonses and complaints applicable to a business acquired by the subsidiary on november   and immediately transferred to a joint venture company  rapak asia pacific limited  in which the subsidiary held a interest 
the complaints allege approximately million in damages for defective products manufactured both before and after november  we have referred these complaints to the insurance carriers that we believe are responsible to defend and indemnify our new zealand subsidiary for the alleged liability 
two of the insurance carriers have agreed to defend the actions subject to reservations of rights 
we also believe we may be entitled to indemnification under various agreements 
based on developments to date  we believe that the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  assets held for sale  assets of discontinued operations  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  including customer returns  rebates  promotions and other incentive programs estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  lifo inventory valuations  litigation accruals and pension obligations accounting for income taxes  estimating the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluating income tax contingencies valuation of stock options impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill estimating the costs to shutdown divested entities and the loss from discontinued operations we recognize sales and cost of sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer and we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebates  returns  promotions or other incentive programs 
customer rebates are based upon rebate agreements based upon predetermined sales volume requirements and accrued at each customer s agreed rebate program 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates of write offs to the average accounts receivable balances over the last months 
when it is deemed probable that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is added to the calculated reserve 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and may be affected by changes in the general economic conditions 
management reviews our physical inventories at each business unit to determine the obsolescence of the products on hand 
our north america operations scrap these inventory items and our international operations establish the appropriate reserves for these items 
we maintain our united states inventory on the lifo method of inventory valuation  except for supplies 
the lifo inventory is reviewed quarterly for net realizable value and adjusted accordingly 
management s current estimated ranges of liabilities related to pending litigation are based on input from legal counsel and management s best estimate of future costs 
final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
we are involved in routine litigation in the normal course of our business and based on facts currently available  we believe such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
we sponsor defined benefit plans for certain foreign employees 
we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased defined benefit pension expense  in fiscal management accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 an asset and liability approach is required 
such approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
the realizability of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
management assesses the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
should the future taxable income of such entities be materially different from management s estimates  an additional valuation allowance may be necessary in future periods 
such amounts  if necessary  could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement encourages but does not require companies to account for employee stock compensation awards based on their estimate fair value at the date of the grant with the resulting cost charged to operations 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles boards opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  but will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning november  in determining the fair value stock options at the date of grant requires extensive use of assumptions including the volatility of our stock price and expected term of our stock options 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those to be reported 
we use our best estimates based upon information available  including recent buy offers  in establishing any asset impairment charges  provisions  writedowns and reserves recorded as a result of a shutdown or divestiture of a subsidiary 
actual realizable values or payments to be made may differ from such estimates  and such differences will be recognized as incurred or as better information is received 
our estimate as to fair value is regularly reviewed and subject to change as new information is made available 
as required by sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired 
we performed our annual impairment analysis under sfas on september  based on a comparison of our market capitalization to our book value at that date 
we also performed a supplemental estimate of the fair value of our company using comparable industry multiples of cash flows compared to our book value 
our policy is that impairment of goodwill will have occurred if the market capitalization of our company were to remain below book value for a period of more than six months or the estimated value of our company based on cash flow multiples is below book value 
should the carrying value of our company exceed its fair value for other than a temporary period of time  the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired at september  we plan to perform our impairment test at september in each fiscal year 
we also review our financial position quarterly for other triggering events as described in sfas no 
new accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp  application of fasb statement no

clarifies how to apply sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the new law s tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities 
the fully phased in deduction is up to nine percent of the lesser of taxable income or qualified production activities income 
fsp no 
requires that the deduction be accounted for as a special deduction in the period earned  not as a tax rate reduction 
fsp no 
 provides guidance under sfas no 
with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the act includes a provision that encourages companies to reinvest foreign earnings in the us by temporarily making certain dividends received by a us corporation from controlled foreign corporations eligible for an dividends received deduction 
the company has elected to take this special one time deduction for dividends received during the year ending october  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning november  the adoption of sfas will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in april  the sec issued release no 
which amended the effective date of sfas r to allow registrants to implement sfas r at the beginning of the next fiscal year beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning november  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
we adopted sfas no 
r on november   using the modified prospective method 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
the company believes that the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we adopted sfas on august  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
under fin  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years ending after december  as such  the company is required to adopt fin by the end of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements about prospects for the future  such as our ability to generate sufficient working capital  amount of excess availability under our credit facility  our ability to continue to maintain sales and profits of our operations and our ability to generate sufficient funds to meet our cash requirements 
we wish to caution readers that the assumptions which form the basis for forward looking statements with respect to  or that may impact earnings or liquidity for  the year ending october   include many factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  availability of raw materials  ability to pass raw material price increases to customers in a timely fashion  the potential of technological changes that would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact our inventory  expected disposal and proceeds received from discontinued operations and assets held for sale  and changes in united states or international economic or political conditions  such as inflation or fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking statements or judgments in this section and in other parts of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize these risks through operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at october   the carrying value of our company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt 
as of october   the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt  which includes the cost of replacing our fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million 
foreign exchange we enter into derivative financial instruments principally foreign exchange forward contracts against the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and new zealand dollar primarily to hedge intercompany transactions and trade sales and forecasted purchases 
foreign currency forward contracts reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual cash inflows and outflows  resulting from these intercompany and third party trade transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we had a total of and open foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at october  and  respectively  with a total notional contract amount of million and million  respectively  all of which have maturities of less than one year 
the net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts were gains of million at october  and losses of million at october   which are included in other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheets and other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also had a total of cash flow hedge contracts outstanding at october   with a total notional contract amount of million all of which had maturities of less than six months 
for the fiscal year ended october  and  the changes in the net fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges by the company was a gain of  and  respectively  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we had no cash flow hedge contracts outstanding at october  and therefore no amount is included in shareholders equity 
our foreign subsidiaries had third party outstanding debt of approximately million on october  such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing our need to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts 
commodities we use commodity raw materials  primarily resin  and energy products in conjunction with our manufacturing process 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices in connection with these components
