other sources of funds include investment management fees  loan repayments  maturities of investment securities  and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
competition the company operates in the highly competitive wealth management market place 
the company believes that by creating regional clusters of companies  it is favorably positioned to access diversified markets to expand its potential client base and mitigate regional economic risks 
in addition  the company believes its regional presence enables it to provide better access to decision makers and more customized personal service for its wealth management clients 
in the company s private banking business  the ability of the banks to attract loans and deposits may be limited by their small size relative to their competitors 
the banks maintain a smaller staff and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which they compete in their market areas 
in particular  in attempting to attract deposits and originate loans  the banks encounter competition from other institutions  including larger national  and suburban based commercial banking organizations  savings banks  credit unions  and other financial institutions and nonbank financial service companies 
the principal methods of competition include the level of loan interest rates charged to borrowers  interest rates paid on deposits  range of services provided and the quality of these services 
to compete effectively  the banks rely substantially on local promotional activity  personal contacts by officers  directors  and employees  personalized service and their reputation within the communities they serve 
in this competitive environment  the banks may be unable to attract sufficient and high quality loans in order to continue their loan growth  which may adversely affect the banks results of operations and financial condition  including the level of their nonperforming assets 
the banks competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
the banks current commercial borrowing customers may develop needs for credit facilities larger than the banks can accommodate 
moreover  under the gramm leach bliley act of the glba  securities firms  insurance 
table of contents companies and other financial services providers that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions 
the glba has significantly changed the competitive environment in which the company and its subsidiaries conduct business 
see bank regulation and supervision below 
the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds among parties 
the ability of boston private s affiliates to attract investment management and trust business may be inhibited by the relatively short history and record of performance at each affiliate 
the company s principal competitors with respect to investment management and trust services are primarily commercial banks and trust companies  mutual fund companies  investment advisory firms  stock brokerage firms  other financial companies and law firms 
many of boston private s competitors have greater resources than its individual affiliates or the company on a consolidated basis 
competition can impact revenue and current and future fee structures 
the company believes that the ability to compete effectively with other firms is dependent upon the products  level of investment performance and client service  as well as the marketing and distribution of the investment products 
moreover  boston private s ability to retain investment management clients may be impaired by the fact that investment management contracts are typically short term in nature  allowing clients to withdraw funds from accounts under management  generally in their sole discretion 
there can be no assurance that boston private will be able to achieve favorable investment performance and retain its existing clients 
in the wealth advisory industry  boston private competes with a wide variety of firms including national and regional financial services firms  accounting firms  trust companies  and law firms 
many of these companies have greater resources and broader product lines  and may already have relationships with boston private s clients in related product areas 
the company believes that the ability of its affiliates  most specifically rinet and kls  to compete effectively with other firms is dependent upon the quality and level of service  personal relationships  and investment performance 
there can be no assurance that rinet or kls will be able to retain their existing clients  expand existing relationships  or add new clients

bank regulatory considerations supervision and regulation in addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers  the company is further subject to federal and state laws and regulations applicable to depository institutions and their parent companies 
virtually all aspects of the company s operations are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight 
state and federal banking laws have as their principal objective the safety and soundness of depository institutions  the federal deposit insurance system  and the protection of depositors  rather than the specific protection of stockholders of a bank or its parent company 
many of the company s affiliates are also subject to regulation under federal and state securities laws as described below under government regulation of other activities 
set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the supervision and regulation of boston private and the banks 
to the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation 
certain restrictions on activities and operations of boston private boston private is a bank holding company a bhc registered with the federal reserve board under the bhca 
as such  boston private and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to the supervision  examination  and 
table of contents reporting requirements of the bhca and the regulations of the federal reserve board 
boston private is also a bank holding company for purposes of the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts  and is subject to the jurisdiction of the massachusetts board of bank incorporation the bbi and the massachusetts commissioner of banks the commissioner 
boston private is also a bank holding company for purposes of the laws of the state of california  and is subject to the jurisdiction of the california department of financial institutions the dfi 
as discussed below  boston private has not elected financial holding company fhc status under the bhca 
for purposes of the bhca  gibraltar  a federal savings association  which boston private acquired in october  is a nonbanking subsidiary 
the federal reserve board has the authority to issue orders to bhcs to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by  or violations of agreements with  the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board is also empowered  among other things  to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate the bhca orders or  among other things  regulations thereunder  to order termination of nonbanking activities of bhcs  and to order termination of ownership and control of a nonbanking subsidiary by a bhc 
bhca activities and other limitations 
the bhca prohibits a bhc from acquiring substantially all the assets of a bank or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank  or increasing such ownership or control of any bank  or merging or consolidating with any bhc without prior approval of the federal reserve board 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate act in general authorizes bhcs to acquire banks located in any state  subject to certain state imposed age and deposit concentration limits  and also authorizes interstate mergers and to a lesser extent  interstate branching 
unless a bhc becomes a fhc under the glba as discussed below  the bhca prohibits a bhc from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or a bhc 
in addition  it prohibits engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks 
however  it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the federal reserve board determines to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks so as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making such determinations  the federal reserve board is required to weigh the expected benefit to the public 
this determination incorporates greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency  against the possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interests or unsafe or unsound banking practices 
as discussed more fully below  massachusetts law imposes certain approval requirements with respect to acquisitions by a bhc of certain banking institutions and to the merger of bhcs 
the glba established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by expanding the bhca framework to permit bhcs that elect to be treated as fhcs to engage in a range of financial activities broader than would be permissible for traditional bhcs  such as boston private  that have not elected to be treated as fhcs 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
in sum  the glba permits a bhc that qualifies and elects to be treated as a fhc to engage in a significantly broader range of financial activities than bhcs  such as boston private  that have not elected fhc status 
in order to elect to become a fhc and thus engage in a broader range of financial activities  a bhc must meet certain tests and file an election form with the federal reserve board 
to qualify  all of a bhc s subsidiary banks must be well capitalized as discussed below under regulation of boston private s banks capital 
table of contents requirements and well managed  as measured by regulatory guidelines 
in addition  to engage in the new activities  each of the bhc s banks must have been rated satisfactory or better in its most recent federal community reinvestment act cra evaluation 
a bhc that elects to be treated as an fhc may face significant consequences if its banks fail to maintain the required capital and management ratings  including entering into an agreement with the federal reserve board which imposes limitations on its operations and may even require divestitures 
such possible ramifications may limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to significantly expand or acquire less than well capitalized and well managed institutions 
at this time  boston private has not elected to become an fhc 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines which it uses in assessing the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bhc and in analyzing applications upon which it acts 
the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines generally require bhcs to maintain total capital equal to of total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items  with at least of that amount consisting of tier i or core capital and the remaining amount consisting of tier ii or supplementary capital 
tier i capital for bhcs generally consists of the sum of common stockholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities both subject to certain limitations and in the case of the latter to specific limitations on the kind and amount of such securities which may be included as tier i capital  and minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and other nonqualifying intangible assets 
tier ii capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities  which is  or to the extent  not eligible to be included as tier i capital  term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan losses 
assets are adjusted under the risk based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements  the federal reserve board requires bhcs to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier i capital defined by reference to the risk based capital guidelines to its average total consolidated assets the leverage ratio of 
total consolidated average assets for this purpose does not include  for example  goodwill and any other intangible assets  unrealized gains or losses on investments and investments that the federal reserve board determines should be deducted from tier i capital 
the leverage ratio requirement is the minimum for the top rated bhcs without any supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses or deficiencies or those which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
all other bhc s are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 
bhc s with supervisory financial  operational or managerial weaknesses  as well as bhc s that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth  are expected to maintain capital ratios above the minimum levels 
finally  the federal reserve board has also imposed certain capital requirements applicable to certain nonbanking activities  including adjustments in connection with off balance sheet items 
us bank regulatory authorities and international bank supervisory organizations  principally the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee  continue to consider changes to the risk based capital adequacy framework which ultimately could affect the appropriate capital guidelines to which boston private and the banks are subject 
in october  the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr concerning potential changes in the risk based capital rules basel ia that are designed to apply to  and potentially reduce the risk capital requirements of bank holding companies  such as boston private  that are not among the or so largest us bank holding companies 
it remains uncertain whether the basel ia rules will be adopted and  even if adopted  how closely the final basel ia rules will resemble the rules described in the anpr and what the effective date of such rules will be 
accordingly  boston private is not yet in a position to determine the effect of such rules on its risk capital requirements 
limitations on acquisitions of common stock 
the federal change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bhc unless the federal reserve board has been given at least days to review and does not object to the proposal 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal 
table of contents reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting securities of a bhc  such as boston private  with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act  would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute the acquisition of control of a bhc 
massachusetts law and california law also impose certain limitations on the ability of persons and entities to acquire control of banking institutions and their parent companies 
the home owners loan act hola and ots regulations impose certain limitations on the ability of third parties to acquire control of gibraltar 
in addition  any company would be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bhca before acquiring in the case of an acquirer that is a bhc or more  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bhc 
cash dividends 
federal reserve board policy provides that a bank or a bhc generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common stock unless the organization s net income available to common stockholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
federal reserve board policy further provides that a bhc should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its stockholders that places undue pressure on the capital of bank subsidiaries  or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bhc s ability to serve as a source of strength to bank subsidiaries 
support of subsidiary institutions and liability of commonly controlled depository institutions 
under federal reserve board policy  boston private is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for  and commit its resources to  supporting the banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
this support may be required at times when boston private may not be inclined to provide it 
in addition  any capital loans by a bhc to any of its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to the payment of deposits and to certain other indebtedness 
in the event of a bhc s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 
a depository institution insured by the fdic  such as boston private bank  borel  fpb  or gibraltar can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of supervisory assistance 
the fdic s claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company  but is subordinate to claims of depositors  secured creditors  and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution 
the banks are subject to these cross guarantee provisions 
as a result  any loss suffered by the fdic in respect of any of the banks would likely result in assertion of the cross guarantee provisions  the assessment of estimated losses against the other banks  and a potential loss of boston private s investments in the banks 
massachusetts law 
as a bhc for purposes of massachusetts law  boston private has registered with the commissioner and is obligated to make reports to the commissioner 
further  as a massachusetts bhc  boston private may not acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a banking institution  merge or consolidate with another bhc or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting stock in any other banking institution if it will own or control more than thereof without the prior consent of the bbi 
as a general matter  however  the commissioner does not rule upon or regulate the activities in which bhcs or their nonbank subsidiaries engage 
california law 
boston private is also a bhc within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  boston private and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the dfi 

table of contents florida law 
gibraltar s primary banking regulator is the ots  therefore  gibraltar is neither subject to examination nor required to file reports with the florida office of financial regulations 
regulation of the banks the banks are subject to the extensive supervision and regulation of various federal and state authorities  which include the fdic  the ots  the dfi and the commissioner 
each of the banks is subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect its business  activities  and operations  and each is supervised and examined by one or more federal or state bank regulatory agencies 
as a massachusetts chartered bank  boston private bank is subject to regulation and examination by the commissioner and the fdic 
borel and fpb are california banking corporations that are subject to regulation by the dfi and the fdic 
gibraltar is subject to regulation and examination by the ots 
each of them is required to file reports with and obtain approvals from these various regulatory agencies prior to entering into certain transactions  including mergers with  or acquisitions of  other financial institutions 
as fdic insured institutions  the banks are also subject to certain requirements applicable to all insured depository institutions 
fdic insurance premiums 
the banks currently pay deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on an assessment rate established by the fdic for bank insurance fund bif member institutions 
the fdic has established a risk based premium system under which the fdic classifies institutions based on their capital ratios and on other relevant information and generally assesses higher rates on those institutions that tend to pose greater risks to the federal deposit insurance funds 
the federal deposit insurance act fdia does not require the fdic to charge all banks deposit insurance premiums when the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to insured deposits is maintained above specified levels 
however  as a result of general economic conditions and a decline in the health of the banking industry  it is possible that the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to insured deposits could fall below the minimum ratio that fdia requires  which would result in the fdic setting deposit insurance assessment rates sufficient to increase deposit insurance reserves to the required ratio 
we cannot predict whether the fdic will be required to increase deposit insurance assessments above their current levels 
in february  congress enacted the federal deposit insurance reform act of the fdir act 
as a result of the passage of the fdir act  over the course of the next year  among other things i the bif will be merged with the fdic s savings association insurance fund creating the deposit insurance fund the dif  ii the  per account insurance level will be indexed to reflect inflation  iii deposit insurance coverage for certain retirements accounts will be increased to  and iv a cap will be placed on the level of the dif and dividends will be paid to banks once the level of the dif exceeds the specified threshold 
capital requirements 
the fdic has promulgated regulations and adopted a statement of policy regarding the capital adequacy of state chartered banks  which  like the banks  are not members of the federal reserve system 
these requirements are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve board regarding bhcs  as described above 
moreover  the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by section of the fdia 
under the regulations  a bank generally shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a tier i risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any written agreement  order or capital directive or prompt corrective action directive  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or more  and a leverage ratio of or greater under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of a well capitalized bank  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage ratio that is less than under certain circumstances  
table of contents significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
an institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements with an appropriate fdic regional director within days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
an institution  which is required to submit a capital restoration plan  must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution 
a critically undercapitalized institution generally is to be placed in conservatorship or receivership within days unless the fdic formally determines that forbearance from such action would better protect the deposit insurance fund 
immediately upon becoming undercapitalized  an institution becomes subject to the provisions of section of the fdia  including for example  i restricting payment of capital distributions and management fees  ii requiring that the fdic monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital  iii requiring submission of a capital restoration plan  iv restricting the growth of the institution s assets and v requiring prior approval of certain expansion proposals 
at december   each of the banks was deemed to be a well capitalized institution for the above purposes 
regulators may raise capital requirements applicable to banking organizations beyond current levels 
we are unable to predict whether higher capital requirements will be imposed and  if so  at what levels and on what schedules 
therefore  we cannot predict what effect such higher requirements may have on us 
as discussed above  the banks would be required to remain well capitalized institutions at all times if we elected to be treated as an fhc 
brokered deposits 
section of the fdia and fdic regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept  renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution s capital category is well capitalized or adequately capitalized 
these restrictions have not had a material impact on the operations of the banks because each of the banks historically has not relied heavily upon brokered deposits as a source of funding 
activities and investments of insured state chartered banks 
section of the fdia generally limits the activities as principal and equity investments of fdic insured  state chartered banks  including boston private bank  borel  and fpb  but not gibraltar  to those that are permissible for national banks 
in  the fdic revised its regulations implementing section of the fdia to ease the ability of fdic insured state chartered banks to engage in certain activities not permissible for national banks  and to expedite fdic review of bank applications and notices to engage in such activities 
further  the glba permits national banks and state banks  to the extent permitted under state law  to engage through financial institutions in certain new activities which are permissible for subsidiaries of an fhc 
further  it expressly preserves the ability of national banks and state banks to retain all existing subsidiaries 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  a national bank or state bank must be well capitalized  and such banks would be subject to certain capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules  among other things 
also  the fdic s final rules governing the establishment of financial subsidiaries adopt the position that activities that a national bank could engage in only through a financial subsidiary  such as securities underwriting  may be conducted only in a financial subsidiary by a state nonmember bank 
however  activities that a national bank could not engage in through a financial subsidiary  such as real estate development or investment  continue to be governed by the fdic s standard activities rules 
moreover  to mirror the federal reserve board s actions with respect to state member banks  the final rules provide that a state bank subsidiary that engages only in activities that the bank could engage in directly regardless of the nature of the activities will not be deemed to be a financial subsidiary 

table of contents activities and investments of federal savings associations 
gibraltar  as a federal savings association  derives its lending and investment powers from the hola  and the regulations of the ots promulgated thereunder 
under these laws and regulations  gibraltar may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and non residential real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
girbraltar may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for gibraltar  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association s assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association s capital on certain construction loans 
qualified thrift lender qtl test 
the hola requires federal savings associations to meet a qtl test 
under the qtl test  a savings association is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets total assets less specified liquid assets up to of total assets  intangibles  including goodwill  and the value of property used to conduct business in certain qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage backed securities  credit card loans  student loans  and small business loans on a monthly basis during at least out of every months 
as of december   gibraltar maintained in excess of of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and qualified under the qtl test 
a federal savings association that fails the qtl test and does not convert to a bank charter generally will be prohibited from engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank  paying dividends not permissible under national bank regulations  and establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association s home state 
in addition  if the association does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the test  the association would be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank and would have to repay any outstanding advances from the applicable federal home loan bank as promptly as possible 
transactions with affiliates 
under sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w thereunder  there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bhc  such as boston private  and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow  obtain credit from or otherwise engage in covered transactions with its fdic insured depository institution subsidiaries 
such borrowings and other covered transactions by an insured depository institution subsidiary and its subsidiaries with its nondepository institution affiliates are limited to the following amounts in the case of one such affiliate  the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed ten percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution  and in the case of all affiliates  the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed twenty percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution 
covered transactions are defined by statute for these purposes to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate  a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate  a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the federal reserve board  the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company  or the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance  or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements 
further  a bhc and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property of any kind  or furnishing of any service 

table of contents community reinvestment act 
the cra requires the fdic and the ots to evaluate the banks performance in helping to meet the credit needs of their entire communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with their safe and sound banking operations  and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions  nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the type of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the purposes of the cra 
massachusetts has also enacted a similar statute that requires the commissioner to evaluate boston private bank s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in considering certain applications 
the fdic s and ots s cra regulations are currently based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests i a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  ii an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and iii a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms  and other offices 
boston private bank s current cra rating is outstanding  borel s current cra rating is satisfactory  and fpb s current cra rating is satisfactory  and gibraltar s current cra rating is outstanding 
in  the federal banking agencies adopted less burdensome cra requirements for intermediate small banks  which are banks with million or more  but less than billion in total assets  including  borel and fpb  under which such banks will be examined using only two tests  a lending test and a new community development test  and will be relieved of certain data collection and reporting requirements 
customer information security 
the fdic  the ots and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines for establishing standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers that implement provisions of the glba the guidelines 
among other things  the guidelines require each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the federal banking regulators have issued guidance for banks on response programs for unauthorized access to customer information 
this guidance  among other things  requires notice to be sent to customers whose sensitive information has been compromised if unauthorized use of this information is reasonably possible 
various states  including california  have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and various bills requiring consumer notice of data security breaches are being considered by congress 
privacy 
the glba requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
in general  the statute requires us to explain to consumers our policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information  and  except as otherwise required by law  we are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in our policies and procedures 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act  designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the united states financial system  has significant implications for depository institutions  broker dealers  mutual funds  insurance companies and businesses of other types involved in the transfer of money 
the patriot act  together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies  has caused financial institutions such as boston private bank  borel  fpb  and gibraltar to implement additional or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to  among other things  anti money laundering compliance  suspicious activities  currency transaction reporting  customer identity verification and customer risk analysis 
in evaluating an application under section of the bhca to acquire a bank or an application under the bank merger act to merge banks or effect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities  the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target 

table of contents massachusetts law dividends 
under massachusetts law  the board of directors of a trust company  such as boston private bank  may declare from net profits cash dividends no more often than quarterly  provided that there is no impairment to the trust company s capital stock 
moreover  prior commissioner approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a trust company in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the previous two years  less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
these restrictions on boston private bank s ability to declare and to pay dividends may restrict boston private s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders 
we cannot predict future dividend payments of boston private bank at this time 
ots regulations dividends 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by gibraltar directly or indirectly to boston private  including dividend payments 
if the total amount of all capital distributions including each proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years  then gibraltar must file an application and receive the approval of the ots for a proposed capital distribution 
regulatory enforcement authority 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution affiliated parties  as defined 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action  including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities 
under certain circumstances  federal and state law requires public disclosure and reports of certain criminal offenses and also final enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies 
securities law issues 
the glba also amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the definition of broker  dealer and investment adviser under the exchange act 
the sec s proposed regulation b  among other things  would adopt amendments to its rule granting an exemption to banks from dealer registration as well as from registration as a dealer with respect to effecting a de minimis number of riskless principal transactions  and to its rule that defines terms used in the bank exception to dealer registration for asset backed transactions  and would include a new exemption for banks from the definition of broker and dealer under the exchange act for certain securities lending transactions 
banks not falling within the specific exemptions provided by the new law may have to register with the sec as a broker  a dealer or both and become subject to sec jurisdiction 
with respect to investment adviser registration  the glba requires a bank that acts as investment adviser to a registered investment company to register as an investment adviser or to conduct such advisory activities through a separately identifiable department or division of the bank so registered 
government policies and legislative and regulatory proposals the operations of the banks are generally affected by the economic  fiscal  and monetary policies of the united states and its agencies and regulatory authorities  particularly the federal reserve bank which regulates the money supply of the united states  reserve requirements against deposits  the discount rate on federal reserve bank borrowings and related matters  and which conducts open market operations in us government securities 
the fiscal and economic policies of various governmental entities and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have a direct effect on the availability  growth  and distribution of bank loans  investments  and deposits

risk factors our business strategy contemplates significant growth and there are challenges and risks inherent in such a growth strategy 
in recent years  we have experienced rapid growth  both due to the expansion of our existing businesses as well as acquisitions 
among the challenges facing us is the ongoing need to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support such growth  including in the areas of management personnel  systems  compliance  and risk management  while taking steps to ensure that the related expense incurred is commensurate with the growth in revenues 
accordingly  there is risk inherent in our pursuit of a growth strategy that revenue will not be sufficient to support such expense and generate profitability at the levels we historically have achieved 
a significant decrease in revenues or increases in costs may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in connection with our recent acquisitions and to the extent that we acquire other companies in the future  our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions 
we continue to consider the acquisition of other banking  investment management  and wealth advisory companies 
to the extent that we acquire other companies in the future  our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to the following the risk that we will incur substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions without completing such acquisitions  the risk that we may lose key clients of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership to us  the risk that the acquired business will not perform in accordance with our expectations  the risk that difficulties will arise in connection with the integration of the operations of the acquired business with the operations of our private banking  investment management  or wealth advisory businesses  particularly to the extent we are entering new geographic markets  the risk that we will need to make significant investments in infrastructure  controls  staff  emergency backup facilities or other critical business functions that become strained by our growth  the risk that management will divert its attention from other aspects of our business  the risk that we may lose key employees of the acquired business  the risk that unanticipated costs relating to potential acquisitions could reduce our earnings per share  the risk associated with entering into geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience  the risk that we may assume potential liabilities of the acquired company as a result of the acquisition  and the risk that an acquisition will dilute our earnings per share  in both the short and long term  or that it will reduce our tangible capital ratios 
as a result of these risks  any given acquisition  if and when consummated  may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  because the consideration for an acquisition may involve cash  debt or the issuance of shares of our stock and may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  existing stockholders may experience dilution in connection with any acquisition 
attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future 
we will continue to consider the acquisition of other businesses 
however  we may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future  which could negatively impact 
table of contents the growth of our business 
we expect that other banking and financial companies  many of which have significantly greater resources than we do  will compete with us to acquire compatible businesses 
this competition could increase prices for acquisitions that we would likely pursue 
also  acquisitions of regulated businesses such as banks are subject to various regulatory approvals 
if we fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests 
competition in the local banking industry may impair our ability to attract and retain banking customers at current levels 
competition in the local banking industry coupled with our relatively small size may limit the ability of our banking subsidiaries to attract and retain banking customers 
in particular  the banks competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are able to serve the credit and investment needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits and range and quality of services provided 
our banks also face competition from out of state financial intermediaries which have opened low end production offices or which solicit deposits in their respective market areas 
because our banks maintain smaller staffs and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which they compete  they may be limited in their ability to attract customers 
in addition  some of the banks current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than our banks can accommodate 
if our banks are unable to attract and retain banking customers  they may be unable to continue their loan growth and their results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted 
we may not be able to attract and retain investment management and wealth advisory clients at current levels 
due to intense competition  our investment management and wealth advisory subsidiaries may not be able to attract and retain clients at current levels 
competition is especially strong in our geographic market area  because there are numerous well established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms in these areas 
many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 
our ability to successfully attract and retain investment management and wealth advisory clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors investment products  level of investment performance  client services and marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we are not successful  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from investment management and trust fees and wealth advisory contracts 
investment management contracts are typically terminable upon less than days notice 
most of our investment management clients may withdraw funds from accounts under management generally in their sole discretion 
wealth advisory client contracts must typically be renewed on an annual basis and are terminable upon relatively short notice 
the combined financial performance of our investment management and wealth advisory subsidiaries is a significant factor in our overall results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our investment management business is highly dependent on people to produce investment returns and to solicit and retain clients 
we rely on our investment managers to produce investment returns 
we believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth of our assets under management 
poor investment performance could impair our revenues and growth because existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products  which would result in lower investment management fees  or our ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish 
the market for investment managers is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of investment managers among different firms 
in addition  our individual investment managers often have regular direct contact with particular clients  which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client s trust in that individual manager 
the loss of a key investment manager could jeopardize our relationships with our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts 
losses of such accounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to the loss of key investment managers  our investment management business is dependent on the integrity of our asset managers and our employees 
if an asset manager or employee were to misappropriate any client funds  the reputation of our asset management business could be negatively affected  which may result in the loss of accounts and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we are required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets  our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected 
when we acquire a business  a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired 
at december   our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately million 
under current accounting standards  if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  we will be required to write down the value of these assets 
we conduct an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future 
any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our stockholders equity and financial results 
defaults in the repayment of loans may negatively impact our business 
a borrower s default on its obligations under one or more of the banks loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of the loan 
in certain situations  where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work out arrangements cannot be reached  our banks may have to write off the loan in whole or in part 
in such situations  the banks may acquire real estate or other assets  if any  which secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies 
in such cases  the amount owed under the defaulted loan often exceeds the value of the assets acquired 
our banks management periodically makes a determination of an allowance for loan losses based on available information  including the quality of their loan portfolio  certain economic conditions  and the value of the underlying collateral and the level of its non accruing loans 
provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period 
if  as a result of general economic conditions or an increase in defaulted loans  management determines that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary  the banks will incur additional expenses 

table of contents in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our banks allowances for loan losses and the values they attribute to real estate acquired through foreclosure or other similar remedies 
such regulatory agencies may require the banks to adjust their determination of the value for these items 
these adjustments could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition 
a downturn in local economies or real estate markets could negatively impact our banking business 
a downturn in the local economies or real estate markets could negatively impact our banking business 
primarily  our banks serve individuals and smaller businesses located in four geographic regions eastern massachusetts  northern california  southern california  and southern florida 
the ability of the banks customers to repay their loans is impacted by the economic conditions in these areas 
the banks commercial loans are generally concentrated in the following customer groups real estate developers and investors  financial service providers  technology companies  manufacturing and communications companies  professional service providers  general commercial and industrial companies  and individuals 
our banks commercial loans  with limited exceptions  are secured by real estate usually income producing residential and commercial properties  marketable securities or corporate assets usually accounts receivable  equipment or inventory 
substantially all of our banks residential mortgage and home equity loans are secured by residential property 
consequently  our banks ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local and regional economic conditions in the real estate markets  or by acts of nature  including earthquakes  hurricanes and flooding 
due to the concentration of real estate collateral in the geographic regions in which we operate  these events could have a material adverse impact on the ability of our banks borrowers to repay their loans and affect the value of the collateral securing these loans 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses 
in the course of business  our banks may acquire  through foreclosure  properties securing loans they have originated or purchased which are in default 
particularly in commercial real estate lending  there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties 
in this event  we  or our banks  might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense 
the cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties 
we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business 
fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the business of our banks 
our banks main source of income from operations is net interest income  which is equal to the difference between the interest income received on interest bearing assets usually loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest bearing liabilities usually deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
our banks net interest income can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates 
changes in relative interest rates may reduce our banks net interest income as the difference between interest income 
table of contents and interest expense decreases 
as a result  our banks have adopted asset and liability management policies to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income  primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans  investments and funding sources 
however  even with these policies in place  a decrease in interest rates can impact our results of operations or financial condition 
an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our banks results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations  which could not only result in increased loan defaults  foreclosures and write offs  but also necessitate further increases to the banks allowances for loan losses 
increases in interest rates  in certain circumstances  may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments  which may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income 
prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business 
generally  our banks customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time 
the speed at which such prepayments occur  as well as the size of such prepayments  are within our customers discretion 
if customers prepay the principal amount of their loans  and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates  our interest income will be reduced 
a significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our cost of funds for banking operations may increase as a result of general economic conditions  interest rates and competitive pressures 
our cost of funds for banking operations may increase as a result of general economic conditions  interest rates and competitive pressures 
our banks have traditionally obtained funds principally through deposits and through borrowings 
as a general matter  deposits are a cheaper source of funds than borrowings  because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings 
historically and in comparison to commercial banking averages  our banks have had a higher percentage of their time deposits in denominations of  or more 
within the banking industry  the amounts of such deposits are generally considered more likely to fluctuate than deposits of smaller denominations 
if  as a result of general economic conditions  market interest rates  competitive pressures or otherwise  the value of deposits at our banks decreases relative to their overall banking operations  our banks may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds in the future 
our investment management business may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions 
our investment management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of such business is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets 
the financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time and are directly affected by  among other factors  domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance  all of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that broad market performance will be favorable in the future 
the world financial and securities markets will likely continue to experience significant volatility as a result of  among other things  world economic and political conditions 
decline in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in our performance and may adversely affect the assets that we manage 
in addition  our management contracts generally provide for fees payable for investment management services based on the market value of assets under management  although a portion of westfield s and dghm s contracts also provide for the payment of fees based on investment performance in addition to a base fee 
because most contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities  fluctuations in securities prices may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our investment management and wealth advisory businesses are highly regulated  which could limit or restrict our activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of our business 
our investment management and wealth advisory businesses are highly regulated  primarily at the federal level 
the failure of any of our subsidiaries that provide investment management and wealth advisory services to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines  suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions including revocation of such subsidiary s registration as an investment adviser 
all of our investment adviser and wealth advisory affiliates are registered investment advisers under the investment advisers act 
the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers  including fiduciary  record keeping  operational and disclosure obligations 
these subsidiaries  as investment advisers  are also subject to regulation under the federal and state securities laws and the fiduciary laws of certain states 
in addition  westfield  sand hill  and dghm act as sub advisers to mutual funds which are registered under the investment company act of and are subject to that act s provisions and regulations 
we are also subject to the provisions and regulations of the employee retirement income security act of erisa  to the extent we act as a fiduciary under erisa with respect to certain of our clients 
erisa and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws  impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each erisa plan which is a client  as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries and certain other related parties to such plans 
in addition  applicable law provides that all investment contracts with mutual fund clients may be terminated by the clients  without penalty  upon no more than days notice 
investment contracts with institutional and other clients are typically terminable by the client  also without penalty  upon days notice

the fdic  the ots  the california department of financial institutions and the massachusetts commissioner of banks possess cease and desist powers to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation  and the federal reserve board possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies 
these and other restrictions limit the manner in which our banks and we may conduct business and obtain financing 
furthermore  our banking business is affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary or legislative policies may affect the interest rates our banks must offer to attract deposits and the interest rates they must charge on their loans  as well as the manner in which they offer deposits and make loans 
these monetary policies have had  and are expected to continue to have  significant effects on the operating results of depository institutions generally  including our banks

westfield and kalson have defended the claim vigorously and will continue to do so 
expert discovery is now completed  and westfield intends to file a motion for summary judgment 
trust litigation since  borel has served as a trustee of a private family trust family trust  which was a joint owner of certain real property known as the guadalupe oil field 
in litigation commenced in  certain beneficiaries of the family trust claimed borel breached its fiduciary duties in managing oil and gas leases on the guadalupe oil field and  following the discovery of environmental contamination on the property  by negotiating  and later finalizing  a settlement agreement and purchase and sale agreement conveying the property to union oil company of california d b a unocal  the operator of the oil field 
in the first lawsuit  in which the beneficiaries sought to remove borel as trustee  borel prevailed at trial and obtained final judgment in its favor 
in several subsequent lawsuits  borel has prevailed on all material issues 
in all such actions  the court has either entered final judgments in borel s favor or voluntary dismissals with prejudice 
one beneficiary a contingent remainder beneficiary has split with the other plaintiff beneficiaries and has refused to participate in the voluntary dismissals with prejudice 
following the dismissal of his separate actions against borel in the state court  this beneficiary  acting pro se  filed a new action on june   in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
in this action  the plaintiff beneficiary makes claims similar to those made in the earlier actions that were dismissed by the state court 
he seeks to invalidate the settlement agreement and purchase and sale agreement  to have the guadalupe oil fields returned to the family 
table of contents trust  and to recover unspecified damages against borel and others for alleged mismanagement of the guadalupe oil field and for sale of the property 
in a trial of the action to remove borel as trustee  the then plaintiff beneficiaries submitted expert testimony to the effect that borel s actions had damaged the family trust in the amount of million 
the trial court found this testimony unpersuasive in that context  and borel and the other defendants prevailed in that action 
in november the federal district court dismissed the entire action as to borel and its co defendants based on the prior final judgments in the state court and on lack of federal jurisdiction 
the plaintiff beneficiary has appealed from the judgment 
appellate briefs have not yet been filed 
borel will continue to litigate these matters vigorously 
while the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  at the present time  borel s management  based on consultation with legal counsel  believes there is no basis to conclude that liability with respect to this matter is probable or that such liability can be reasonably estimated

the following table sets forth the high and low closing sale prices for the company s common stock for the periods indicated  as reported by nasdaq high low fiscal year ended december  fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter fiscal year ended december  fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter dividends the company presently plans to pay cash dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis dependent upon the results of operations of the immediately preceding quarters 
however  declaration of dividends by the 
table of contents board of directors of the company will depend on a number of factors  including capital requirements  regulatory limitations  the company s operating results and financial condition and general economic conditions 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are the principal assets of the company  and as such  provide the main source of payment of dividends by the company 
as to the payment of dividends  as discussed below  each of the banks is subject to the laws and regulations of its chartering jurisdiction and to the regulations of its primary federal regulator 
if the federal banking regulator determines that a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  the regulator may require  after notice and hearing  that the institution cease and desist from such practice 
depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  an unsafe or unsound practice could include the payment of dividends 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
the federal agencies have also issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
the company paid dividends on its common stock of and in and  respectively 
under massachusetts law  trust companies  such as boston private bank  may pay dividends only out of net profits provided there is no impairment to the trust company s capital stock and surplus account 
although massachusetts law does not define what constitutes net profits it is generally assumed that the term includes a bank s retained earnings and does not include its additional paid in capital account 
furthermore  trust companies may not pay dividends more often than on a quarterly basis 
in addition  prior commissioner approval is required if the total of all dividends paid by a trust company in any calendar year would exceed net profits for that year combined with retained net profits for the previous two years  less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
likewise under california law  the department of financial institutions the dfi has the authority to prohibit borel and fpb from paying dividends depending on borel s and fpb s financial condition  respectively  if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
furthermore  under ots regulations  the ots has the authority to prohibit gibraltar from paying dividends if the ots concludes that the payment of such dividends reduces gibraltar s capital below its minimum capital requirements  violates a statute  regulation  regulatory agreement or regulatory condition to which gibraltar is subject or would otherwise constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
these restrictions on the banks ability to pay dividends to the company may restrict the ability of the company to pay dividends to the holders of the common stock 
the payment of dividends by boston private and the banks may also be affected or limited by other factors  such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines
