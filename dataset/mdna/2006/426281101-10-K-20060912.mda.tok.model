item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview background and overview we provide integrated computer systems for in house and outsourced data processing to commercial banks  credit unions and other financial institutions 
we have developed and acquired banking and credit union application software systems that we market  together with compatible computer hardware  to these financial institutions 
we also perform data conversion and software implementation services for our systems and provide continuing customer support services after the systems are implemented 
for our customers who prefer not to make an up front capital investment in software and hardware  we provide our full range of products and services on an outsourced basis through our six data centers and item processing centers located throughout the united states 
a detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows 
all amounts are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal to fiscal and compare fiscal to fiscal we derive revenues from three primary sources of revenue software licenses  support and service fees  which include implementation services  and hardware sales  which includes all non software remarketed products 
over the last five fiscal years  our revenues have grown from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net income has grown from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this growth has resulted primarily from internal expansion supplemented by strategic acquisitions  allowing us to develop and acquire new products and services for approximately  customers who utilize our core software systems as of june  since the start of fiscal  we have completed acquisitions 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 
license revenue represents the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer

support and services fees are generated from implementation services contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software  and from providing outsourced data processing services and atm and debit card processing services 
outsourcing services are performed through our data and item centers 
revenues from outsourced item and data processing and atm and debit card processing services are derived from monthly usage fees typically under five year service contracts with our customers 
cost of license fees represents the third party vendor costs associated with license fee revenue 
cost of services represents costs associated with conversion and implementation efforts  ongoing support for our in house customers  operation of our data and item centers providing services for our outsourced customers  atm and debit card processing services  and direct operation costs

the significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the application of these pronouncements requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements  and whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of our products over time 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in our ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 
license fee revenue 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or elements 
none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 
sop  as amended by sop  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately 
in the event that we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized the residual method allowed by sop under the residual method  a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 
support and service fee revenue 
implementation services are generally for installation  training  implementation  and configuration 
these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software 
vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately 
generally revenue is recognized when services are completed 
on certain larger implementations  revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation 
milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours 
maintenance support revenue is recognized pro rata over the contract period  typically one year 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 
outsourced data processing services and atm  debit card  and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered 
hardware revenue 
hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer  when title and risk of loss are transferred 
in most cases  we do not stock in inventory the hardware products we sell  but arrange for third party suppliers to drop ship the products to our customers on our behalf 
for these transactions  the company follows the guidance provided in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
based upon the indicators provided within this consensus  the company records the revenue related to our drop ship transactions at gross and the related costs are included in cost of hardware 
the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers 
hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 
depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists 
we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term  but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company s future consolidated operating results 
all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements
