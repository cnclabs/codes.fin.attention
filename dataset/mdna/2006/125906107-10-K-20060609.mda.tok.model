item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview approximately of the company s sales are attributable to seasonal christmas  valentine s day  easter and halloween products  with the remainder being attributable to everyday products 
seasonal products are sold primarily to mass market retailers and the company typically has relatively high market shares in many of these seasonal categories 
most of these markets have shown little or no growth in recent years  and we continue to confront significant cost pressure as our competitors source certain products from overseas and our customers increase direct sourcing from overseas factories 
increasing customer concentration has increased their bargaining power which has also contributed to price pressure 
the company has taken several measures to respond to cost and price pressures 
css has increased its investment in product and packaging design and product knowledge to assure it can continue to provide unique added value to its customers 
in addition  css substantially expanded an office and showroom in hong kong to better meet customers buying needs and to be able to provide alternatively sourced products at competitive prices 
css also increased its focus on efficiency and productivity in its north american production and distribution facilities to maintain its competitiveness domestically 
in the last three fiscal years  the company has closed two manufacturing plants and four warehouses totaling  square feet 
the company s everyday craft product line has higher inherent growth potential due to higher market growth rates 
further  the company s everyday craft and floral product lines have higher inherent growth potential due to css relatively low current market shares 
the company has established project teams to pursue top line sales growth in these and other areas 
the company has experienced cost increases in certain key materials  supplies and logistics services 
these increases will continue to impact fiscal and will require that management either obtain price increases from its customers or find other means of reducing material product and delivery costs 
the seasonal nature of css business results in low sales and operating losses in the first and fourth quarters and high shipment levels and operating profits in the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year  thereby causing significant fluctuations in the quarterly results of operations of the company 
historically  significant growth at css has come through carefully chosen and executed acquisitions 
management anticipates that it will continue to utilize acquisitions to stimulate further growth 
litigation as previously discussed in item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k  on may   the company s cleo subsidiary filed a complaint in united states court of international trade appealing the itc final determination that  in part  resulted in the imposition of duties on certain tissue paper products imported from china on or after september  in the fiscal year ended march   the company recognized an expense of approximately  for these duties  reflecting cleo s estimated liability for duties relating to subject tissue paper products that cleo imported from china during the fiscal year  based on the applicable deposit rates established by the us commerce department 
the amount of cleo s actual liability for tissue duties pertaining to the fiscal year ended march   which liability is capped at the deposit rates in effect with respect to the period of time that the subject products were imported by cleo  will be determined at the time of liquidation of the applicable entries by the united states bureau of customs border protection 
liquidation of the applicable entries has been enjoined pending the decision of the united states court of international trade in cleo s appeal of the itc s final determination 
css and its subsidiaries are also involved in ordinary  routine legal proceedings that are not considered by management to be material 
in the opinion of company counsel and management  the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the company or its results of operations

as payment for sales of christmas related products is usually not received until after the holiday selling season in accordance with general industry practice  short term borrowing needs increase throughout the second and third quarters  peaking prior to christmas and dropping thereafter

critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
below are the most significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
revenue revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damaged in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase or decrease significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
accounts receivable the company offers seasonal dating programs related to certain seasonal product offerings pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms 
customers generally do not have the right to return product except for reasons the company believes are typical of our industry  including damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
with few exceptions  the company is not required to repurchase products from its customers  nor does the company have any regular practice of doing so 
in addition  
back to contents the company mitigates its exposure to bad debts by evaluating the creditworthiness of its major customers utilizing established credit limits and purchasing credit insurance when appropriate 
bad debt and returns and allowances reserves are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable while reserves for customer programs are recorded as accrued liabilities 
the company evaluates accounts receivable related reserves and accruals monthly by specifically reviewing customer s creditworthiness and historical recovery percentages regarding various types of customer deductions 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is primarily determined by the first in  first out method although certain inventories are valued based on the last in  first out method 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
additional inventory write downs could result from unanticipated additional carryover of finished goods and raw materials  or from lower proceeds offered by parties in our traditional closeout channels 
goodwill goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test  the first step of which must be performed at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for each of the reporting units  the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a multiple of earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense state  federal and foreign  including the impact of permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the management of the company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the company using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements and impact of those standards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial exposures are actively monitored and  where considered appropriate  managed by the company as described below 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
pursuant to the company s variable rate lines of credit  a change in either the lender s base rate or libor would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds thereunder 
based on average borrowings under these credit facilities of  for the year ended march   a increase or decrease in floating interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense by approximately  foreign currency risk approximately of the company s sales in fiscal were denominated in a foreign currency 
the company considers its risk exposure with regard to foreign currency fluctuations insignificant as it enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the majority of firmly committed transactions and related receivables that are denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has designated its foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized in earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses on the foreign denominated assets that they are intended to hedge
