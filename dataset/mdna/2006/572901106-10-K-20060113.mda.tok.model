our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this document  and we do not intend to update these statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after that date 
general martek was founded in we are a leader in the development and commercialization of products derived from microalgae  fungi and other microbes 
our leading products are nutritional oils used as ingredients in infant formula and foods and beverages and as ingredients in  and encapsulated for use as  dietary supplements 
our nutritional oils are comprised of fatty acid components  primarily docosahexaenoic acid  commonly known as dha  and arachidonic acid  commonly known as ara 
research has shown that these fatty acids may enhance mental and visual development in infants  that they may play a pivotal role in brain function throughout life  and that they may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease 
low levels of dha in adults have been linked to a variety of health risks  including alzheimer s disease 
further research is underway to assess the role of supplementation with our dha on a variety of health risks 
additional applications of our patented technology based upon microalgae include our currently marketed fluorescent detection products that can be used by researchers as an aid in drug discovery and diagnostics 
in  we realized our first revenues from license fees related to our nutritional oils containing dha and ara and sales of sample quantities of these oils 
in  we recognized our first product and royalty revenues from sales of infant formula containing these oils  and in we began to realize revenues from the sale of neuromins  a dha dietary supplement 
in  we first realized revenues from the sale of our fluorescent detection products 
in  the fda completed a favorable review of our generally recognized as safe notification for the use of our dha and ara oil blend in specified ratios in infant formula 
we have entered into license agreements with infant formula manufacturers  who collectively represent approximately of the estimated to billion worldwide wholesale market for infant formula and nearly of the estimated to billion us wholesale market for infant formula  including the wholesale value of women  infant children program wic rebates 
wic is a federal grant program administered by the states for the benefit of low income  nutritionally at risk women  infants and children 
our licensees include infant formula market leaders mead johnson nutritionals  nestle  abbott laboratories  wyeth and royal numico  each of whom is selling infant formula fortified with our nutritional oils 
our licensees are now selling term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries and pre term infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries around the world 
supplemented term infant formulas manufactured by mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  wyeth and nestle are currently being sold in the united states 
in april  we acquired omegatech  inc omegatech or martek boulder  a low cost algal dha producer located in boulder  colorado 
omegatech had been in the fermentable dha business since  and had accumulated over issued and pending patents protecting its dha technology 
its revenues mainly consisted of sales of dha into the dietary supplement and animal feed markets 
we acquired omegatech to obtain its low cost dha oil and related intellectual property for use in the adult supplements market and future use in the food and beverage markets 
in june  the australia new zealand food standards council authorized the use of dha s oil for use as a novel food ingredient in australia and new zealand 
in june  the european commission authorized the use of our dha s oil and declared that our dha s oil may be sold in the european community as a novel food ingredient 
this novel food designation authorizes the use of our dha s as an ingredient in certain foods such as certain dairy products  including cheese and yogurt but not milk based drinks  spreads and dressings  breakfast cereals  food supplements and dietary foods for special medical purposes in the european community 
in february  the fda completed a favorable review of our gras notification for the use of dha s in food and beverage applications 
we are currently selling dha s products in the dietary supplement  food and beverage and animal feed markets domestically and internationally 
in september  we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of fermpro manufacturing  lp  which operated a fermentation facility located in kingstree  south carolina 
fermpro provided contract fermentation services and had an experienced workforce of over personnel on a site of over acres with extensive fermentation  recovery  laboratory and warehousing capabilities 
the addition of the fermpro facility and workforce has enabled us to expand our production capabilities through the existing facility  as well as the significant plant expansion that was completed in fiscal during the past two years  several new products were launched that contained martek dha  including mead johnson launched expecta lipil  a dha supplement for pregnant and nursing women containing martek dha 
pbm products launched a beverage containing martek dha that is formulated for diabetics and people with atypical glucose tolerance 
glaxosmithkline launched a second powdered drink mix containing martek dha in india 
the product  junior horlicks  is formulated for a child s developing brain and nervous system 
glaxosmithkline has previously launched an adult dha beverage 
first horizon pharmaceutical has recently launched optinate and mission pharmacal will soon launch citrical prenatal dha 
both of these products are prescription prenatal supplements containing martek dha 
vincent foods  llc has begun offering oh mama nutrition bars containing martek dha  which also target pregnant and nursing women 
several egg producers  including gold circle farms  are now offering eggs and liquid eggs using martek dha 
these eggs are sold in several grocery store chains in the us and europe 
pri gola has launched simbi omega yogurt with martek dha  which is now available in major supermarket chains throughout spain and is being marketed to children and adults for its brain health benefits 
all of these products are expected to generate additional revenue for us during fiscal prior to fiscal  we incurred losses in each year since our inception 
for the years ended october   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million of net income  respectively  and as of october   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
although we anticipate continued growth in annual sales of our nutritional oils  and we have achieved an operating profit in each of the last three fiscal years  we may continue to experience quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in our future operating results  some of which may be significant 
the timing and extent of such fluctuations will depend  in part  on the timing and receipt of oils related revenues 
the timing and extent of future oils related revenues are largely dependent upon the following factors the timing of infant formula market introductions by our licensees both domestically and internationally  the timing and extent of stocking and destocking of inventory by our licensees  including the potential that licensees will move to just in time inventory purchasing now that we have reached a base finished goods inventory level  the timing and extent of introductions of dha into various child and or adult applications  the continued acceptance of products containing our oils under state administered reimbursement programs in the us  the continued acceptance of these products by consumers and continued demand by our customers  the ability by us  dsm and other third party manufacturers to produce adequate levels of our nutritional oils on a consistent basis  our ability to protect against competitive products through our patents  competition from alternative sources of dha and ara  and agreements with other future third party collaborators to market our products or develop new products 
as such  the likelihood  timing and extent of future profitability are largely dependent on factors such as those mentioned above  as well as others  over which we have limited or no control 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  which are based on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and  as such  actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including fixed assets and certain identified intangibles  for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
as of october   these long lived assets had a total net book value of million 
included in these long lived assets are approximately million of qualified production equipment whose use is not currently required due to excess capacity 
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
while management believes that its projections are reasonable and that no impairment of these assets exists  different assumptions could affect these evaluations and result in material impairment charges against the carrying value of these assets 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from two sources product sales and contract manufacturing 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the product is shipped thereby transferring title and risk of loss 
typical infant formula license contracts include an upfront license fee  a prepayment of product sales and established pricing on future product sales 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the consideration from these contracts is allocated based on the relative fair values of the separate elements 
revenue is recognized on product sales when goods are shipped and all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
cash received as a prepayment on future product purchases is deferred and recognized as revenue when product is shipped 
revenue from product licenses is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
royalty income is recorded when earned  based on information provided by our licensees 
contract manufacturing revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
cash received that is related to future performance under such contracts is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
deferred income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we also recognize deferred tax assets for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
as of october   our total gross deferred tax asset was million 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and the future operations of the company 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a change to our valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
as of october   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million  which related primarily to certain net operating loss carryforwards whose realization is uncertain 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in material amounts of additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for excess  obsolete and off spec inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand and the likelihood of consumption in the normal course of manufacturing operations 
those reserves are based on significant estimates 
our estimates of future product demand or assessments of future consumption may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts and assessments  any significant unanticipated changes  particularly in demand or competition levels  could have a significant impact on the values of our inventory and our reported operating results 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations  which require us to recognize compensation cost for the excess of the fair value of the stock at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which require the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation for non employees is accounted for using the fair value based method in accordance with sfas see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
management outlook from fiscal through early fiscal  the demand for our nutritional oils by our customers for use in infant formula products exceeded production output and capacity and  as such  we limited the orders we accepted for our nutritional oils 
some of our customers responded to the shortages and inconsistent supply by building inventory  and we have had difficulty in predicting with certainty our customers future ordering in light of limited visibility into our customers supply chains and expansion plans 
to improve visibility into our customers planned orders and to better understand the base level of orders required to meet current demand  we have worked closely with our customers to obtain new order projections 
to address our production output and capacity issues  we and dsm have added production capacity 
as a result  we are no longer limiting the orders we accept for nutritional oils  and  furthermore  we have been able to accumulate and expect to maintain dha and ara finished goods inventory at levels which no longer constrain revenue growth 
we believe that the outlook for future revenue growth remains positive  although quarterly results may show significant fluctuations 
specifically  we believe that over the next twelve to eighteen months  our infant formula product sales in the us market will continue to grow at a measured pace consistent with the consumer demand growth for fortified infant formula 
expansion by our customers into new international markets offers a potentially higher growth rate  but is subject to the timing of the launches 
we also believe that we will continue to gain market share in existing international markets and new products containing our oils will be launched by licensees 
in fiscal  approximately of our product sales revenues related to the sales of our oils for use in infant formula  pregnancy and nursing supplements and toddler products 
we anticipate increased future sales of our oils for other products such as foods and beverages developed to promote cognitive function and cardiovascular health 
we expect that the majority of these sales will come through collaborative relationships with larger companies in the nutritional and food and beverage markets 
we anticipate that over the next few years  these sales will expand and could ultimately represent a larger potential market than infant formula 
production we manufacture oils rich in dha at our fermentation and oil processing facilities located in winchester  kentucky and kingstree  south carolina 
as of october   we have completed the extensive expansion at our kingstree facility for the fermentation and processing of our nutritional oils 
we have spent approximately million on the expansion since the inception of the project in fiscal our ara oils are purchased from dsm as manufactured at its capua  italy and belvidere  new jersey plants 
dsm recently completed its expansion of its ara production capabilities at its belvidere facility  which has been increasing its quarterly output 
this has allowed us to build our ara inventory and we are continuing to build this ara inventory in the short term  until the belvidere facility exhibits more consistent production performance 
we are now receiving approximately one half of our ara from dsm s belvidere facility 
because dsm is a third party manufacturer  we do not have full control over the timing and level of its capua and belvidere production volumes 
annual ara pricing utilizes a cost plus arrangement and is based on the prior year s actual costs incurred adjusted for current year expectations 
calendar ara purchases have been valued by us based on pricing established through this methodology and invoiced from dsm 
as part of our april agreement with dsm  we are required to guarantee the recovery to dsm of certain expansion costs incurred by them 
our guarantee to dsm which relates to their phase one expansion and was initially valued at million has been eliminated through ara purchases in the normal course of business 
in addition  we are in the process of finalizing an amendment to the april agreement with dsm 
this amendment  among other things  will establish our guarantee of dsm s phase two expansion costs 
this guarantee will have a maximum value of million  with such amount being reduced annually through december  based upon ara purchases in excess of a specified minimum threshold 
as of december   this phase two proposed guarantee has been reduced to approximately million  with this reduction occurring primarily in the second half of upon completion of dsm s phase two expansion we have attempted to reduce the risk inherent in having a single supplier  such as dsm  through certain elements of the supply agreement entered into with dsm in april in connection with this agreement  we have licensed the dsm technology associated with ara production 
through this license and the overall supply arrangement  we have the ability to produce  either directly or through a third party  an unlimited amount of ara 
the sale of such self produced ara is limited annually  however  to the greater of i tons of ara oil or ii any amounts ordered by us that dsm is unable to fulfill 
during fiscal  we demonstrated the ability to produce limited amounts of ara in our plants 
to further improve our overall ara supply chain  we have directly engaged a us based provider of certain post fermentation ara manufacturing services and have added additional ara downstream processing capacity at kingstree 
along with our pending ara extraction capabilities at kingstree  the addition of the third party facility provides us with multiple us sites for the full downstream processing of ara 
when combining our current dha production capabilities in winchester and kingstree with dsm s current ara production capabilities in italy and the us  we have production capacity for dha and ara products in excess of million in annualized sales to the infant formula  dietary supplement and food and beverage markets 
as such  our production capabilities exceed current demand  however  we have the ability to manage production levels and  to a certain extent  control our manufacturing costs 
nonetheless  when experiencing excess capacity  we may be unable to produce the required quantities of oil cost effectively 
we also have several other contractual agreements with third party manufacturers to assist in the production of our nutritional oils 
among them  we have an agreement for the production of dha s biomass that we sell to animal feed companies or process further for use in the adult supplement and food and beverage markets 
we currently have a minimum purchase commitment under this agreement that expires on june  as of october   our remaining obligation was approximately million 
we do not anticipate extending this third party arrangement due to the recent refinement and scale up of our internal production capabilities for dha s at both our winchester  kentucky and kingstree  south carolina facilities 
the commercial success of our nutritional oils will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture these oils or have them manufactured at large scale on a continuous basis and at a commercially acceptable cost 
our success will also be somewhat dependent on our ability to align our production with customer demand 
if market demand subsides due to our inability to meet demand for our products  our results could be negatively impacted 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to successfully optimize production of our nutritional oils  or continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including gmp requirements 
under the terms of several of our infant formula licenses  our licensees may elect to manufacture these oils themselves 
we are currently unaware of any of our licensees producing our oils or preparing to produce our oils  and estimate that it would take a licensee a minimum of one year to implement a process for making our oils 
acquisitions and dispositions in september  we purchased  through a wholly owned subsidiary  certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of fermpro  which operated a fermentation facility located in kingstree  south carolina 
the addition of the fermpro facility added to our production capabilities and has allowed us to establish a second manufacturing facility that now has redundant capabilities 
the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed included a payment of approximately million  comprised of million in cash   shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  and approximately million in acquisition related fees and expenses 
in addition  a million note was assumed as part of the transaction 
the results of operations of fermpro have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income from the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the assumed assets and liabilities of fermpro based on their relative fair values 
in april  we completed our acquisition of omegatech for approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was related to the value of  shares of our common stock million of which related to omegatech transaction costs paid by us  approximately million was for our acquisition related fees and expenses  and approximately million was related to the fair value of  vested omegatech stock options that were assumed as part of the transaction 
the merger agreement also provides for additional stock consideration of up to million  subject to certain pricing adjustments  if certain milestones are met 
two of these milestones relate to operating results sales and gross profit margin objectives by october and october and two relate to regulatory approvals in the us and europe 
one of the regulatory approval milestones related to the granting of novel foods approval in europe for the omegatech dha s oil 
in june  the european commission granted approval of the use of this oil in certain foods in the european community  meeting the conditions of this regulatory milestone 
accordingly  approximately  shares of martek common stock  with a fair market value of approximately million  were issued during the third quarter of fiscal the payment of this additional consideration was recorded as goodwill 
as of october   we do not believe the second regulatory milestone has been achieved 
in addition  we do not believe that either financial milestone related to sales and gross profit margin for the periods ended october  and has been achieved 
the representative of the former omegatech stockholders has advised us that he believes that the common stock issuable with respect to the second regulatory milestone as well as the financial milestone related to the period ended october  should be issued 
martek disagrees with that conclusion 
as discussed in item of part i of this form k  legal proceedings  we are currently involved in litigation to resolve the dispute with respect to the second regulatory milestone 
the total martek common stock that may be issued relating to the three remaining milestones is subject to a formula that is based on the average market price of our stock on the dates that the individual milestones are determined to have been achieved  up to a maximum of million shares 
any contingent consideration paid related to these milestones would be recorded as goodwill 
results of operations revenues the following table presents revenues by category in thousands year ended october  product sales contract manufacturing sales total revenues product sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher sales of nutritional products to our infant formula licensees 
substantially all of our product sales in fiscal and relate to the sale of our oils for use in infant formulas 
included in product sales in fiscal was million in sales of dha oil for the pregnancy and nursing market  such sales having begun during the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately of our product sales in fiscal was generated by sales to mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  nestle and wyeth 
although we are not given precise information by our customers as to the countries in which infant formula containing our oils is ultimately sold  we estimate that approximately two thirds of our sales to infant formula licensees for fiscal relate to sales in the us the first infant formulas containing our oils were introduced in the us in february and  as of october   we estimate that formula supplemented with our oils had penetrated approximately of the us infant formula market 
product sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a continued increase in sales of our oils to both existing and new infant formula licensees 
substantially all of our product sales in fiscal relate to the sale of our oils for use in infant formulas 
approximately of our fiscal product sales revenue was generated by sales to mead johnson nutritionals  abbott laboratories  wyeth and nestle 
we anticipate that annual product sales will continue to grow 
our future sales growth is dependent to a significant degree upon the following factors i the launches and expansions of products containing our nutritional oils by our customers in new and existing markets  ii our ability to maintain a consistent flow of production  iii the launches of new products containing our nutritional oils by current or future customers  and iv the availability of competitive products 
contract manufacturing sales revenues  totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  relate to fermentation work performed for various third parties at our kingstree  south carolina facility 
as a result of the above  total revenues increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost and expenses the following table presents our operating costs and expenses in thousands year ended october  cost of revenue cost of product sales cost of contract manufacturing sales operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative other operating expenses restructuring charge total costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to dha productivity improvements a decrease of approximately partially offset by an increase in our overall cost of ara due primarily to the decline of the us dollar against the euro  the currency in which we purchase a portion of our ara 
cost of product sales increased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases resulted from our use of air freight in connection with ara shipments from europe an increase of approximately  internal production inefficiencies in connection with the commencement of dha manufacturing at the kingstree plant an increase of approximately and an increase in our overall cost of ara due to the decline of the us dollar against the euro an increase of approximately 
such increases  however  were partially offset by dha production improvements a decrease of approximately  savings from the introduction of lower cost ara from dsm s belvidere facility a decrease of approximately and insurance receipts by us associated with incidents at dsm production plants a decrease of approximately 
we expect our gross profit margins in fiscal to continue to reflect the benefits of the newly implemented dha productivity improvements  but expect these benefits to be offset by certain idle capacity period costs in related primarily to our kingstree facility and slight increases to our average per unit ara purchase costs 
cost of contract manufacturing sales cost of contract manufacturing sales  totaling million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  are the costs related to the fermentation work performed for various third parties at our kingstree  south carolina facility 
our contract manufacturing sales achieve significantly lower gross margins than our product sales but contribute to the recovery of our fixed overhead costs 
these overall margins will vary between periods primarily due to contract mix 
research and development our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to additional resources focused on dha and ara production improvements and the development of new dha products for the food and beverage industry  as well as the commencement of new dha clinical studies focusing on the neurological and cardiovascular benefits of dha 
our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of additional resources directed toward improving the quality and stability of our products and lowering our dha production cost by increasing our fermentation production yields and developing new downstream processing techniques 
the increase was also due to the commencement of new development projects  including development of ara fermentation methods  development of dha products for the food and beverage industry  exploration of new dha applications and long term development of plant based dha under the collaboration agreement with a canadian biotechnology company 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs increase of million  legal costs increase of million and insurance costs increase of million required to manage our overall growth as well as the costs of sarbanes oxley act compliance increase of million and certain patent related expenses increase of million 
our selling  general and administrative costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal of the increase  approximately million relates to the addition of the kingstree  south carolina plant acquired in september  for which the administrative infrastructure was assumed and supports the new facility and its expansion 
the remaining increase was primarily due to additional personnel million and increased insurance costs million 
other operating expenses we incurred other operating expenses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to production start up costs associated with the expansion at our kingstree facility in fiscal and and our winchester facility in fiscal  which include training expenses and costs related to the scale up and validation of new equipment and production processes 
these costs in fiscal were comprised largely of start up costs related to the qualification of internal ara production in kingstree and winchester and dha and dha s production in kingstree 
these costs also include qualification of certain third party manufacturers as well as expenses related to the winchester wastewater treatment matter 
other income  net our other income  net  increased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to changes in interest and other income resulting from varying levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and changes in interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of cash on hand 
income tax provision benefit the non cash provision for income taxes totaled million in fiscal and has been recorded based upon our effective tax rate of 
in fiscal  we reversed approximately million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this reversal resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million  a direct increase to stockholders equity of approximately million due to historical non qualified stock option exercises and a decrease to goodwill of approximately million due to certain basis differences and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from our acquisition of omegatech 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount will expire  if unused  by the end of fiscal with the remainder expiring through fiscal of the total net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million continues to be fully reserved through a valuation allowance as realizability of these assets is uncertain at this time 
should realization of these and other deferred tax assets become more likely than not  approximately million of the resulting benefit will be reflected as an income tax benefit upon reversal of the allowance  approximately million will be reflected as a reduction to goodwill and approximately million will be reflected as an increase to stockholders equity 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income was million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb concluded that sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  would be effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of sfas r to the annual period beginning after june  sfas r provides two tentative adoption methods 
the first method is a modified prospective transition method whereby a company would recognize share based employee costs from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas r would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used previously under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the second adoption method is a modified retrospective transition method whereby a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of sfas r in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation costs in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of sfas r unless those changes represent a correction of an error 
for periods after the date of adoption of sfas r  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and intend to use the modified prospective method  although we continue to review our alternatives for adoption under this new pronouncement 
based upon our projection of unvested stock options at the implementation date and potential future option grants  we expect the adoption to result in the recognition of additional compensation cost of approximately million to million during fiscal in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal as we were already in compliance with the guidance of sfas  the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from the following sources cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of equity securities  cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and debt financing 
at october   our primary sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as well as the available portion of our revolving credit facility of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from october  this decrease was primarily the result of planned increases to our dha and ara inventory levels  which no longer constrain revenue growth 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million  the majority of which occurred during the first half of the fiscal year and related to the expansion of the kingstree facility  which is now complete 
we generated cash flow from financing activities of million  primarily proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million in public offerings  partially offset by the net repayment of million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
investments in our production facilities in kingstree  south carolina and winchester  kentucky have had a material effect upon our liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  however  with the completion of our expansion in kingstree  we expect that capital expenditures during fiscal will not exceed million 
throughout the construction periods  all interest incurred on borrowings has been capitalized to the extent that the borrowings were used to cover the balance of projects under construction 
in fiscal  we incurred interest on borrowings of approximately million and recorded amortization of related debt fees of approximately  the majority of which was capitalized 
since our inception  we have raised approximately million from public and private sales of our equity securities  as well as from option and warrant exercises 
in august  our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement enables us to raise funds through the offering of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants  as well as any combination thereof  from time to time and through one or more methods of distribution  in an aggregate amount of up to million 
in january  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at price of per share pursuant to the shelf registration statement 
net proceeds to us  after deducting an underwriting discount and offering expenses  amounted to approximately million 
of the proceeds  million was used for the partial repayment of debt with the remainder intended to be used for capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
remaining availability under the shelf registration statement is approximately million at october  the following table sets forth our future minimum payments under contractual obligations at october  less than more than in thousands total year years years years notes payable borrowings under revolving credit facility operating lease obligations dsm license fee and other obligations unconditional inventory purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations minimum payments above include interest and principal due under these notes 
included within notes payable is a million note with a stated interest rate of that we assumed as part of the acquisition of fermpro 
the note was amended in january and is now an unsecured obligation of the company with a maturity date of december  principal is amortized over a year period  with the balance due at maturity 
in september  we entered into a million secured revolving credit facility which amended and expanded the existing million credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and all capital stock of our subsidiaries and expires in september the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was approximately and for the years ended october  and  respectively  and the weighted average commitment fee rate on unused amounts was approximately in both periods 
both the interest and commitment fee rates are based on libor and the company s current leverage ratio 
among other things  the credit facility agreement contains restrictions on future debt  the payment of dividends and the further encumbrance of assets 
in addition  the credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including minimum coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios 
we do not believe that these covenants restrict our ability to carry out our current business plan 
as of october   we were in compliance with all of these debt covenants and had outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility 
in october and december  we entered into operating leases for equipment at our kingstree facility as part of sale leaseback transactions 
the equipment subject to lease was sold at its aggregate cost basis and fair value of million and simultaneously leased back to us 
the leases expire in october and contain the same restrictions as our revolving credit facility 
in april  we entered into a new agreement with dsm extending the existing relationship between the two companies involving the production and supply of ara  one of our nutritional oils that we sell to our infant formula licensees 
among other things  this agreement provides for the grant to us by dsm of a license related to certain technologies associated with the manufacture of ara 
this grant involved a license fee totaling million  million of which was paid upon execution of the agreement  million of which was paid on november   and the remaining million of which was paid on november  in december  we executed a collaboration agreement with a canadian biotechnology company to co develop dha products from plants 
in addition to reimbursement of expenses incurred by the co collaborator  we are contingently liable for milestone payments upon achievement of certain scientific results 
as of october   a milestone payment of up to million would be paid to our co collaborator in fiscal if the milestone related to the current phase of the project is achieved 
due to the current status of the project  we have not recorded a liability for this contingency  nor have we included this contingency in the table above 
we believe that the revolving credit facility  when combined with our cash and short term investments of million on hand at october   and anticipated operating cash flows  will provide us with adequate capital to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve to eighteen months 
the ultimate amount of additional funding that we may require will depend  among other things  on one or more of the following factors the cost and extent of capital expenditures at our manufacturing facilities  growth in our infant formula  food and beverage and other nutritional product sales  the extent and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical studies  the time and costs of obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances for our products that are subject to such clearances  the costs involved in filing  protecting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the development or acquisition of new products  the cost of acquiring additional and or operating and expanding existing manufacturing facilities for our various products and potential products depending on which products we decide to manufacture and continue to manufacture ourselves  the costs associated with our internal build up of inventory levels  the costs associated with our defense against putative securities class action lawsuits  and the costs of marketing and commercializing our products 
we can offer no assurance that  if needed  any of our financing alternatives will be available to us on terms that would be acceptable  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into lease agreements for certain laboratory and administrative space as well as manufacturing equipment with rental payments aggregating million over the remaining lease terms  which expire through included in these aggregate rentals are amounts related to certain equipment leases  for which we are contingently liable for a residual value guarantee of approximately million 
as part of our agreement with dsm  we agreed to guarantee dsm s recovery of certain expansion costs incurred by them 
our guarantee to dsm which relates to their phase one expansion and was initially valued at million has been eliminated through ara purchases in the normal course of business  and the value of our guarantee to dsm which relates to dsm s phase two expansion will have a maximum value of million  with such amount being reduced annually through december  based upon ara purchases in excess of a specified minimum threshold 
as of december   this phase two proposed guarantee has been reduced to approximately million  with this reduction occurring primarily in the second half of upon completion of dsm s phase two expansion 
we do not engage in any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
beginning in january  purchases of ara from dsm s plant in capua  italy were denominated in euros  which exposes us to risks related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro will impact our cost of ara oil and gross margins 
we estimate that a change in the exchange rate would impact gross margins of our infant formula products by approximately 
our exposure to these currency fluctuations has begun to slightly decrease as dsm now produces ara in the us at its belvidere  new jersey facility 
in april  we began entering into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the related market risk on our payment obligations 
we do not enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges for speculative purposes 
at october   we had unrealized gains on such hedge instruments totaling  net of income tax provision 
we are subject to risk from adverse changes in interest rates  primarily relating to variable rate borrowings used to maintain liquidity and finance our manufacturing facility expansion 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at october   a change in libor would change annual interest by  at october   the carrying amounts of debt approximate fair value
