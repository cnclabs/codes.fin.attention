table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with arbitron s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this form k 
overview arbitron is an international media and marketing research firm primarily serving radio  cable television  advertising agencies  advertisers  outdoor and out of home media and  through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
arbitron currently has four main services measuring radio audiences in local markets in the united states and mexico  measuring national radio audiences and the audience size and composition of network radio programs and commercials  providing application software used for accessing and analyzing media audience and marketing information data  and providing consumer  shopping and media usage information services to radio  cable television  advertising agencies  advertisers  retailers  outdoor and out of home media  online industries and  through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
significant customers arbitron s quantitative radio audience measurement business and related software sales accounted for approximately percent and percent of its revenue for and  respectively 
consolidation in the radio broadcasting industry has led to arbitron s dependence on a limited number of key customers 
in  clear channel and cbs radio  formerly known as infinity broadcasting corp  represented approximately percent and nine percent  respectively  of arbitron s revenue 
arbitron s agreements with these customers are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligations 
arbitron currently has license agreements with clear channel to provide radio ratings and software services for clear channel s radio stations and networks through the company s fall survey 
arbitron currently has license agreements with cbs radio to provide audience estimates  software and other ancillary services to cbs radio s radio stations through the company s winter survey 
arbitron cannot give any assurances that it could replace the revenue that would be lost if a key customer failed to renew all or part of its agreements with arbitron 
the loss of a key customer would materially impact arbitron s business  financial position and operating results 
portable people meter for several years  arbitron has pursued a strategy of evolving its data collection business from diaries  which are completed by hand and mailed in by respondents  to portable electronic measurement devices  which passively provide measurement services without additional manual effort by the respondents 
this strategy has been pursued to improve quality by taking advantage of new technological capabilities and to address the vast increase in media delivery vehicles  both inside and outside of the home 
arbitron has developed a portable people meter ppm system capable of measuring radio  broadcast television  cable television  internet broadcasts  satellite radio and television audiences  and retail store video and audio broadcasts 
a few significant events occurred during in june  clear channel  the largest owner of radio stations in the united states  announced that it was issuing a request for proposals to create a state of the art radio ratings system to replace the current diary measurement system to which it subscribes 
on december   clear channel issued a press release in which it announced that arbitron is one of the seven finalists in their request for proposals process 
clear channel has targeted march  as the date for selection of a final measurement method  with a live test period planned to begin in the spring of 
table of contents in july  the results of a ppm economic impact study were released 
this study  which was led by the radio advertising bureau and funded by arbitron  reported on the potential impact to the radio industry of electronic measurement and a move from diaries to the ppm for radio audience measurement 
the results of the study indicated that advertising expenditures associated with the radio industry would likely increase with a fully deployed ppm electronic ratings system and decrease with a continuation of the existing diary system of radio audience measurement 
to date  arbitron has signed a number of national and regional advertising agencies to ppm contracts 
these agencies account for more than percent of the national advertising dollars spent on radio advertising 
arbitron believes this is a significant start in an effort to gain a critical mass of industry support for deploying the ppm as a local market radio ratings system 
although additional milestones remain  critical decision points for arbitron in pursuing commercial deployment of the ppm are likely only a few months away 
while the possibility remains that implementation of commercialization of the ppm could be delayed  or that a competitor might preempt ppm commercialization entirely  arbitron continues to believe that the ppm service represents a viable replacement for its diary based ratings service and is an essential component of the company s future growth 
as arbitron has previously disclosed  commercialization of the ppm will require a substantial financial investment 
while the company has preserved its cash and short term investments in anticipation of such requirements  the expenditures likely to be incurred in connection with such commercialization are significant 
the company currently believes that the aggregate capital investment associated with ppm commercialization for audience ratings measurement could be in the range of million to million for the first two to three years of commercialization  with higher ranges of investment by arbitron needed in the event nielsen media research does not join arbitron in the commercialization of the ppm 
in addition  over the same period  arbitron anticipates that its results of operations will be negatively impacted as a result of the rollout of this ppm service  which impact likely will be material 
ultimately  the company believes that  while commercialization of ppm for the ratings service will have a near term negative impact on the company s results of operations  its operating margins can be restored to historical levels by the end of the rollout period  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
two significant factors will greatly affect the amount of capital required for deployment of the ppm and the impact of the rollout on the company s results of operations 
first  since arbitron s primary customers are radio station owners  the speed with which the radio industry requests ppm technology will greatly affect the timing of the rollout 
if the radio industry is slow to accept electronic measurement as opposed to the use of diaries  then it will take longer to roll out the commercialization of the ppm  and the costs associated with that deployment will be delayed 
on the other hand  if the radio industry asks for electronic measurement sooner rather than later  arbitron s capital needs will intensify  and the near term negative impact on the company s results of operations will be more significant 
second  a significant variable in determining the ultimate costs to arbitron in commercializing the ppm is whether nielsen media research  inc  a provider of us television and cable audience measurement services  will join with arbitron in the commercial deployment of the ppm 
in may  arbitron entered into an agreement with nielsen media research under which arbitron granted nielsen media research an option to join arbitron in the potential commercial deployment of the ppm for audience measurement in the united states 
now that arbitron believes that the ppm s viability has been demonstrated as a result of the houston market test  arbitron expects that nielsen media research will make a decision in early as to whether to join in the commercialization of the ppm 
if nielsen media research elects to join arbitron in commercializing the ppm  the ppm will be deployed to provide audience measurement for both the television and radio industries  and the costs of such commercialization will be shared with nielsen media research in some form to be agreed upon by the parties 
arbitron and nielsen media research would each be licensed to use the data generated by the jointly deployed ppm in their respective media measurement services and arbitron would also receive royalties from nielsen media research 

table of contents if nielsen media research elects not to join arbitron in commercializing the ppm  arbitron intends to deploy a ppm service for audience measurement solely to the radio industry  at least initially 
this will require arbitron to bear all of the costs associated with the rollout of the ppm service 
arbitron retains the right under the option agreement to  at any time  license  test and or implement a commercial deployment of the ppm and the technology contained in the ppm outside of the united states 
in the event nielsen media research exercises its option to form the joint venture in the united states  nielsen media research also has the option to purchase from arbitron  at fair value  a portion of arbitron s interest  up to percent  in all audience measurement business activities arising out of the commercial deployment of the ppm and the technology contained in the ppm outside of the united states 
portable people meter national marketing panel project apollo arbitron began testing additional marketing research applications of the ppm technology in one application that arbitron began testing was the use of the ppm as the media collection tool for a national marketing oriented panel designed to correlate advertising with shopping behavior and sales 
the objective is to provide multimedia exposure data combined with sales data from a single source to produce a measure of advertising effectiveness for advertisers  agencies and broadcasters 
in september  arbitron announced that arbitron and vnu  inc vnu agreed to jointly explore the development of a new national marketing research service  called project apollo  that collects multimedia and purchase information from a common sample of consumers 
in april  arbitron and vnu entered into a cost sharing agreement to share costs and capital expenditures associated with the development and deployment  by year end  of a pilot panel of more than  households as a demonstration of the national marketing research service  and the parties currently are discussing entering into a formal joint venture for this service 
procter gamble  one of the country s leading consumer products companies  is collaborating with the two companies to help ensure that the service properly addresses the needs of marketers 
at this time  six advertisers  including procter and gamble  who in the aggregate spend more than billion on advertising on measured media  have signed  or are in the process of signing  an agreement for the project apollo pilot panel data 
this innovative service would consist of a panel of participants  each of whom would receive incentives to carry arbitron s ppm which would collect the participants exposure to multiple media sources 
data on consumer preferences and purchases  with respect to a wide range of services and products  would also be collected from panelists  electronically and through surveys  with the expectation of using households from vnu s acnielsen homescan consumer panel  which currently tracks packaged goods purchases 
data would be collected in aggregate form to provide an understanding of participants media interactions and their resulting shopping and purchasing behavior 
the ultimate objective would be to provide advertisers with an enhanced ability to determine the return on investment for their marketing efforts 
the national marketing research service is a new service  for which market acceptance is not yet known 
like the audience measurement services for ratings  this service would require substantial additional expenditures if it ultimately proves to be a viable commercial service 
in  the company incurred approximately million of incremental expenditures relating to the national marketing pilot  approximately million of which constituted expenses that had a direct impact on the company s operating income and approximately million of which were capitalized 
arbitron also currently expects to incur incremental expenses of million relating to project apollo in that will have a direct impact on the company s operating income 
if a decision is made to commercialize this service  substantial additional expenditures would be incurred in the next few years 
since the pilot program for the ppm national marketing service has just begun and customer response is very preliminary  it is not yet possible to provide a meaningful assessment of future costs associated with a potential commercialization of this service 
however  the same general cost pattern would apply as with the ppm ratings service substantial costs would have to be incurred in advance of revenues  which would result in a negative impact on results of operations in the first two to three years of commercialization  which impact likely would be material 

table of contents response rates and sample proportionality arbitron uses listener diaries to gather radio listening data from sample households in the united states local markets for which it currently provides radio ratings 
a representative sample of the population in each local market is randomly selected for each survey 
this sample is recruited by telephone to keep a diary of their radio listening for one week 
participants are asked to designate in their diary the station s to which they are listening  when they are listening and where they are listening  such as home  car  work or other place 
to encourage their participation in the survey  arbitron gives diarykeepers a modest cash incentive 
arbitron processes more than million diaries every year to produce its audience listening estimates 
it is increasingly difficult and more costly to obtain consent from the phone sample to participate in the surveys 
arbitron must achieve response rates sufficient to maintain confidence in its ratings  the support of the industry and accreditation by the media rating council 
response rates are a quality measure of survey performance and an important factor impacting costs associated with data collection 
overall response rates have declined over the past several years 
if response rates continue to decline further  arbitron s radio audience measurement business could be adversely affected 
arbitron commits extensive efforts and resources to address the decline of response rates 
despite additional initiatives  response rates continued to decline in the fall survey 
a measure often used by clients to assess quality in arbitron s surveys is proportionality  which refers to how well the distribution of the sample for any individual survey matches the distribution of the population in the market 
in recent years  arbitron s ability to deliver good proportionality in its surveys among younger demographic groups has deteriorated  caused in part by the trend among some households to disconnect their landline phones  effectively removing these households from the arbitron sample frame 
arbitron has conducted a number of research tests over the past two years addressing this issue  including calling cellular phones to place diaries 
the company expects to announce a plan designed to improve young adult response rates and proportionality by the end of the first quarter of small market initiatives in may  arbitron announced a program designed to increase the stability of radio audience estimates in certain small markets by applying a quarterly rolling sample approach to surveys covering small markets 
the goal of this program is to provide quality enhancements for our service in certain small markets and increase the reliability of reported data by reducing the fluctuations in audience estimates from measurement period to measurement period 
by combining the quarterly measurement of the related surveys  the sample size for analyzing audience demographics for these small markets will be increased without any increased cost to our customers 
this program is being implemented in two phases beginning with the release of the fall radio survey results in the first quarter of stock repurchase on june   arbitron announced that its board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at the prevailing market price through november as of august   the repurchase program was completed with  shares repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during january  the company announced a new million repurchase program to be conducted through december  as of february   no shares had been repurchased under this new program 
dividends arbitron announced on february   that its board of directors approved the payment of the company s first quarterly cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend was paid on april   to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  for the second  third  and fourth quarters ended june   september   and december   respectively  dividends approved in the amount of per common share  were also paid on july   october   and january   respectively 

table of contents acquisition on september   arbitron acquired the assets of integrated radio systems  llc irs for million  including million in transaction costs 
irs is a provider of software systems that help radio stations manage their advertising sales process and automate the daily tasks in a sales department 
the irs applications combine a customer relationship management system with scheduling and research applications and with inventory pricing management tools 
impact of hurricane katrina as a result of the suspension of services in new orleans and surrounding areas within the hurricane katrina impact zone  arbitron issued credits to local customers and will discontinue billing to stations and advertising agencies in the affected areas for the cost of local market report services 
arbitron will continue to monitor the situation in these markets  and as market conditions improve  will discuss with customers plans for resuming service 
the total loss of revenue due to storm damage and business interruption is currently estimated at million over the years ended december  and  with million of the total expected for arbitron is exploring whether some of these losses are covered under its current insurance policies 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company capitalizes software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements 
the costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
management performs an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
as of december  and  the company s capitalized software developed for internal use had a carrying amount of million and million respectively  including million and million  respectively  of ppm software 
arbitron uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting arbitron s financial position and results of operations 
during  certain liabilities for tax contingencies related to prior periods were reversed due to the settlement and completion of certain income tax audits and returns and the expiration of audit statutes 
also  the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets was reduced to reflect the estimated future benefit of

mrp was acquired on march  and therefore  the year ended december  had the benefit of the full twelve months of operations as compared to approximately ten months for the same period of irs was acquired on september  these increases were partially offset by a million net decrease in scarborough revenue and a million decrease in continental research revenue 
the net decrease in scarborough revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was significantly impacted by the accelerated delivery of markets during the fourth quarter of rather than the first quarter of due to the slow economic growth of the radio industry  as well as the high penetration of current services in the core radio station business  arbitron expects that its future annual organic rate of revenue growth will be slower than historicaltrends
