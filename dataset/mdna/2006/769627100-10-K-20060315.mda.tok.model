item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overall outlook and recent developments we own and operate riviera las vegas on the las vegas strip in las vegas  nevada  and riviera black hawk in black hawk  colorado 
our capital expenditures for riviera las vegas are geared to maintain the hotel rooms and amenities in sufficient condition to compete for customers in the convention market and mature adult customers 
room rates and slot revenues are the primary factors driving our operating margins 
we use technology to maintain labor costs at a reasonable level  including kiosks for hotel check in and slot club redemptions 
in addition  we are in the process of updating our gaming monitoring systems  including adding tito capability on our slot machines 
as of december  all of our slot machines had been converted to the new gaming monitoring system 
as of december  we had slot machines  or approximately of our slot machines in las vegas  on tito 
in black hawk  the maximum bet restricts table games to a minimum and the area is basically a locals slot customer market 
our capital expenditures in black hawk are geared to maintain competitive slot machines compared to the market 
the gaming authorities approved tito systems in colorado for riviera black hawk on december  and we had of our slot machines on the tito system as of december  by the end of we had slot machines  or of our slot machines in black hawk  on tito and on december  we had machines  or of our slot machines on tito 
on december   our ceo entered into an agreement with a group of buyers for he sale of on million of his shares of our stock at per share and the possibility of the sale of substantially all of his approximately million shares was consummated 
in connection with that agreement  it was reported that the buyers intended to commence negotiations with us to acquire our company at a price of not less than per share 
on march   discussions between the special committee of our board of directors and the buyers of our ceo s shares  concerning their possible acquisition of our company  terminated because the buyers and tour special committee did not agree on the acquisition price 
effective march   we effected a three for one split of our common stock 
this increased the number of outstanding shares of our common stock net of treasury shares to  all per share related information in this form k has been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
on february   we announced that we requested our financial advisor  jefferies company  inc to explore strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value 
on november  we announced the conclusion of that process because it did not produce opportunities that were satisfactory to our board of directors 
during that process  alternatives that we explored included development of our las vegas property  refinancing  joint ventures  mergers  and realizing the value of our stock through other means 
although this formal process has been concluded  we will continue to consider strategic opportunities if and when they arise and we consider them to be in our and our shareholders best interests 
in  we entered into confidential discussions regarding a potential sale of our company 
discussions with one potential buyer  which commenced in  ended in and we retained a one million dollar fee paid to us by that third party 
such amount was reflected in our first quarter results 
in order to attain profitable operations  we must reach income from operations before equity based compensation  asset impairment  sarbanes oxley act expenses and mergers  acquisitions and development costs of approximately million  an increase of approximately over current levels 
going forward  we expect our sarbanes oxley act expenses to decrease significantly as we move into our second year of being an accelerated filer  we estimate our future annual equity based compensation to be approximately  and we expect asset impairment charges to be nominal 
mergers  acquisitions and development costs are in large part the results of contacts made or opportunities presented by third parties  which may be outside of our control and may require our attention and resources in view of our fiduciary duties to shareholders 
if  however  we can significantly reduce our merger  acquisition and development costs and meet our estimated requirements mentioned above in this paragraph  our income from operations would approach million  which would slightly exceed our interest expense and would likely result in a nominal net income 
if we are able to refinance our notes at a more favorable interest rate  we could save in excess of million for each full percentage point reduction in interest rate 
this could have a significant positive effect on our net income 
however  as discussed in risk factors we will need to refinance our notes in order to repay them  and refinancing terms may be unfavorable to us  it is uncertain whether we can obtain a more favorable interest rate through a refinancing 
our stockholders approved the implementation of two new stock option plans and the allocation a total of  shares to those plans at our may  annual meeting 
we allocated  shares to a new option plan for non employee directors 
we will grant options for  shares to each non employee director on each anniversary of the effective date of that plan  which was may  also  we will grant options for  shares to each person who becomes a non employee director after the effective date of the plan 
the option exercise price will be the closing market price of our stock on the date of the option grant 
the options will vest and become exercisable over five years at per year  commencing on the first anniversary of the grant 
we also allocated one million shares to a new incentive stock option plan for our officers and key employees 
our stock option committee will have discretion as to whom those options will be granted  the number of shares to be allocated to each option grant and the vesting and exercisability schedule for each option grant 
the option exercise price will be not less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant except in the case of an option grant to a beneficial owner of more than of our outstanding stock  for which the exercise price will not be less than of our stock s fair market value on the grant date 
in the second quarter of  we granted a total of  shares of our stock to executives and four non employee directors in full substitution for stock options for  shares that we attempted to grant to them under our old stock option plans after their june  expiration date 
the recipients have full rights of ownership with respect to these shares  except that their ability to transfer the shares is subject to a vesting schedule and a non employee director can lose some or all of his shares if he voluntarily leaves our board of directors before he reaches results of operations compared to the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data for riviera las vegas and riviera black hawk

as a result of these surveys of our customers  we have revised our marketing plans to include activities  which our customers favor  including more entertainment on the casino floor during the daytime hours and more food and beverage options

in our interest expense was million 
corporate expenses decreased from million in to million in due to expenses in associated with a shareholder vote to amend our articles of incorporation 
net loss the consolidated net loss decreased approximately million  from million in to million in mainly due to increased income from operations as explained above 
results for were impacted by development and projects costs totaling million 
we filed an application with the new mexico racing commission the nmrc in march of for a racino in hobbs  new mexico 
we and three other prospective licensees made presentations to the nmrc in november of the nmrc awarded the racino license to one of the other applicants and we wrote off million of costs associated with the project 
in addition during we wrote off development and project costs associated with our proposed missouri gaming project totaling million 
in august  the missouri gaming commission awarded the license to one of the other applicants and we wrote off an additional million in costs associated with the project 
the missouri costs coupled with new mexico wind up costs of  in resulted in a total write off of million in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  increased million from december  cash balances include amounts that may be required to fund our ceo s pension obligation in a rabbi trust with five days notice 
see notes and to the financial statements 
although we are aware of no current intention of our ceo to require this funding  under certain circumstances  approximately million would have to be disbursed in a short period 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million compared to million in due primarily to a decrease in operating income 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in due to a decrease in capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in we believe that cash flow from operations  combined with the million cash and the million available on our senior secured credit facility discussed below  will be sufficient to cover our annual debt service and enable our investment in budgeted capital expenditures 
such expenditures include approximately million in maintenance capital expenditures approximately million of which we will use to purchase approximately tito machines for both properties and property upgrades of approximately million  which we will use primarily to complete the room renovation program at rivera las vegas and for contingencies 
on june   we secured new debt in the principal amount of million in the form of the notes with a maturity date of june  interest on the notes is at the annual rate of  paid semiannually on each june and december the net proceeds of the notes  along with cash on hand  were used to defease riviera las vegas first mortgage notes due and to defease riviera black hawk s first mortgage notes with contingent interest due cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the notes at maturity 
accordingly  our ability to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon our ability to refinance the notes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity or that any such refinancing will be on favorable terms 
on or after june   we may redeem the notes from time to time at a premium beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in the note indenture provides that  in certain circumstances  we must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  we would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit our ability  subject to certain exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  sell certain assets  and enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  we would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs under these circumstances  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
as of december   we believe that we were in compliance with the covenants 
on july   we entered into a million  five year senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially the same collateral that secures the notes 
the lien on the collateral securing the credit facility is senior to the lien securing the notes 
the credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing and certain representations and warranties customary in gaming related finance 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants and restrictions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  distributions and changes in control 
under the credit facility  we can obtain extensions of credit in the forms of cash and letters of credit 
we are required to pay interest on all outstanding cash advances at the rate of interest announced by wells fargo bank at its principal office in san francisco at its prime rate plus  or at the rate at which major international banks in london charge each other for borrowings in us dollars plus 
however  the minimum interest rate we will be charged on outstanding cash advances is self insurance reserves can be affected by price changes in the medical field  speed of processing claims by our third party administrator  estimates of claims incurred but not reported  homogeneous nature of claims and other factors 
significant changes in those factors could affect the estimates for self insurance by  or more 
a increase in medical costs could impact our reserves and increase our expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
contractual obligations the table under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  sarbanes oxley act requirements on june   the applicable measurement date for accelerated filer status  our public float market capitalization exceeded million 
consequently  we became an accelerated filer in and we are required to comply with the reporting requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act for the year ended december  we expensed additional first year accelerated filer costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act 
we have incurred approximately million of these costs through december  these costs are shown separately in our income statement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to adopt accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and provision for income taxes 
we periodically evaluate our policies  and our estimates and assumptions related to these policies 
we operate in a highly regulated industry 
for riviera las vegas and riviera black hawk we are subject to regulations governing operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips and tokens  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
future actual results might differ materially from these estimates 
we have determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because such estimates are highly uncertain or susceptible to change so as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance  and such policies and estimates were selected from among available alternatives  or require the exercise of significant management judgment to apply 
long lived assets we have a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
we estimate that the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these non discounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect our operating results 
we estimate useful lives for our assets based on historical experience  estimates of such classes of assets commercial lives generally  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  we would record an impairment charge 
we review useful lives  and obsolescence  and we assess commercial viability of these assets periodically 
deferred tax assets we utilize estimates related to projected future cash flow in the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
these estimates are made using assumptions about the economic  social and regulatory environments in which we operate and could be negatively impacted by numerous unforeseen events including changes to regulations affecting how we operate our business  changes in the labor market or economic downturns in the areas where we operate 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and our operating results 
litigation cost accrued we assess our exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters  and we provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
however  any accruals made in relation thereto do not include the estimated costs of defense for any legal services that we have not yet received 
if the actual loss from a contingency exceeds our estimate  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
self insurance provisions we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and non union employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and provisions include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  we consider our historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
loyalty club program we offer to our guests the opportunity to earn points redeemable for cash and complimentary rooms and food and beverage based on their level of gaming and non gaming activities while at our properties 
an accrual is recorded as points are earned based upon expected redemption rates and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentary to be provided 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost related to share based employee compensation transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
share based employee compensation transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the provisions of sfas r are to be effective for us beginning january in december  we accelerated the vesting on all non employee directors options then outstanding  and as a result  there will be no effect of applying the new standard on future periods with respect to currently outstanding employee and directors options 
we cannot predict the effect of the new standard on the accounting for future option grants 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirement for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles not prescribed by specific transition provisions of the newly adopted standard 
it carries forward without change the requirements of apb opinion no 
for accounting for error corrections and changes in estimates 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for accounting changes made in the fiscal year beginning after december  we do not presently expect to enter into any accounting changes in the foreseeable future that would be affected by adopting sfas no 
when it becomes effective 
in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fas fin requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
when sufficient information exists  uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the liability measurement 
the interpretation was effective for us for the year ended december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position
