item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were established to continue to operate and expand the retail property business of our predecessor 
we commenced our operations in april our assets are held by  and all operations are conducted through  agree limited partnership the operating partnership  of which agree realty corporation is the sole general partner and held a interest as of december  we are operating so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
on january   we completed an offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
on february   the underwriter exercised its over allotment option for an additional  shares at the same per share price collectively  the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of agree realty corporation  including the respective notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  to expand and clarify sfas no 
in several areas 
the statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost is recognized over the requisite service period usually the vesting period for the estimated number of instruments where service is expected to be rendered 
this statement is effective for the interim reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect that our financial statements will be materially impacted by sfas no 
r 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the impact of adopting this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle

the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation pursuant to existing laws or by contract to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information 
table of contents to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin was effective no later than fiscal years ended after december  the company adopted fin as required effective december  and the initial application of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies in the course of developing and evaluating accounting policies and procedures  we use estimates  assumptions and judgments to determine the most appropriate methods to be applied 
such processes are used in determining capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
minimum rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants 
certain leases provide for additional percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes 
these percentage rents are recognized when determinable by us 
in addition  leases for certain tenants contain rent escalations and or free rent during the first several months of the lease term  however such amounts are not material 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 
in determining the fair value of real estate investments  we consider future cash flow projections on a property by property basis  current interest rates and current market conditions of the geographical location of each property 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our tax year 
as a result  we are not subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute annually at lease of our taxable income to our shareholders and satisfy certain other requirements defined in the code

during the quarter ended december   we declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share 
the dividend was paid on january  to holders of record on december  as of december   we had total mortgage indebtedness of  with a weighted average interest rate of 
future scheduled annual maturities of mortgages payable for the years ending december are as follows      the mortgage debt is all fixed rate  self amortizing debt 
in addition  the operating partnership has in place a million credit facility with lasalle bank  as the agent credit facility  which is guaranteed by the company 
the credit facility matures in november and can be extended at our option  for an additional three years 
during the three year extension period  we will have no further ability to borrow under the credit facility and will be required to repay a portion of the unpaid principal on a quarterly basis 
advances under the credit facility bear interest within a range of one month to six month libor plus basis points to basis points or the lender s prime rate  at our option  based on certain factors such as debt to property value and debt service coverage 
the credit facility is used to fund property acquisitions and development activities and is secured by most of the properties which are not otherwise encumbered and properties to be acquired or developed 
as of february    was outstanding under the credit facility bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we also have in place a million line of credit line of credit  which matures on june   and which we expect to renew for an additional month period

the following table outlines our contractual obligations in thousands as of december  total yr yrs yrs over yrs mortgages payable notes payable land lease obligations other long term liabilities interest payments on mortgages and notes payable total we intend to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the leasing and improvement of the properties  through cash flow provided by operations and the line of credit 
we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
we intend to incur additional debt in a manner consistent with 
table of contents our policy of maintaining a ratio of total debt including construction and acquisition financing to total market capitalization of or less 
we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
we plan to begin construction of additional pre leased developments and may acquire additional properties  which will initially be financed by the credit facility and line of credit 
we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt and or equity 
upon completion of refinancing  we intend to lower the ratio of total debt to market capitalization to or less 
nevertheless  we may operate with debt levels or ratios  which are in excess of for extended periods of time prior to such refinancing 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation  ffo can help an investor compare the operating performance of our real estate between periods or compare such performance to that of different companies 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo in making our calculation  our method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and accordingly may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

table of contents the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and year ended december  net income depreciation of real estate assets amortization of leasing costs minority interest gain on sale of assets funds from operations weighted average shares and op units outstanding basic dilutive item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on remaining debt  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at  and  for fixed rate debt and variable rate debt  respectively 
the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or position  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
