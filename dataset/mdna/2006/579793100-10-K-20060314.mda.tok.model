table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company was founded in with william p 
mccormick s acquisition of jake s famous crawfish in portland  oregon 
we grew our family of restaurants slowly through the next two decades and in  when we owned restaurants  a majority interest in our company was purchased by castle harlan partners ii  lp  a private investment firm 
avado brands purchased us in we operated as a division of avado brands and added new restaurants in just under four and a half years 
in august  avado brands sold our company to castle harlan partners iii  lp castle harlan and bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  ii  lp brs  private equity investment firms that actively invest in restaurant companies 
we have expanded our restaurant base to restaurants  at december   including two restaurants operated pursuant to management contracts 
we have grown our business by offering our customers a daily printed menu with a broad selection of affordable  quality fresh seafood in an upscale environment  serviced by knowledgeable and professional management and staff 
our revenues are generated by sales at our restaurants  including banquets 
in  banquets accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in  food and non alcoholic beverage sales accounted for approximately of revenues and the remaining of revenues was from the sale of alcoholic beverages 
we measure performance using key operating indicators such as comparable restaurant sales  food and beverage costs  and restaurant operating expenses  with a focus on labor as a percentage of revenues and total occupancy costs 
we also track trends in average weekly revenues at both the restaurant level and on a consolidated basis as an indicator of our performance 
the key operating measure used by management in evaluating our operating results is operating income 
operating income is calculated by deducting restaurant operating costs  general and administrative expenses  restaurant pre opening costs  depreciation and amortization and other corporate costs from revenues 
we monitor general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  which we monitor to be within our budgeted levels 
restaurant pre opening costs are analyzed based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and by comparison to budgeted amounts  with an overall target of approximately to million per restaurant opening  which may include up to million in non cash rent expense during the construction period 
the most significant restaurant operating costs are food and beverage costs and labor and related employee benefits 
we believe our national and regional presence allows us to achieve better quality and pricing on key products than most of our competitors 
we closely monitor food and beverage costs and regularly review our selection of preferred vendors on the basis of several key metrics  including pricing 
in addition  because we print our menu at least once daily in each of the majority of our restaurants  we are able to adapt the seafood items we offer to changes in vendor pricing to optimize our revenue mix and mitigate the impact of cost increases in any particular seafood item by substituting a lower cost alternative on our menu or by adjusting the price 
with respect to labor costs  we believe the combination of future growth in revenues and the resulting greater leverage of our vice presidents of operations and regional managers will allow us to better leverage payroll expenses over time 
our employee benefits include health insurance  the cost of which continues to increase faster than the general rate of inflation 
we continually monitor this cost and review strategies to effectively control increases but we are subject to the overall trend of increases in healthcare costs 
general and administrative expenses are controlled in absolute amounts and monitored as a percentage of revenues 
as we have continued our growth and became a public company  we have incurred substantial training costs and made significant investments in infrastructure  including our information systems 
as we continue to grow and are able to leverage investments made in our people and systems  we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues over time 

table of contents identification of appropriate new restaurant sites is essential to our growth strategy 
we evaluate and invest in new restaurants based on site specific projected returns on investment 
we believe our store model and flexible real estate strategy provide us with continued opportunities to find attractive real estate locations on favorable terms 
strategic focus and operating outlook our primary business focus for over years has been to consistently offer a broad selection of high quality  fresh seafood  which we believe commands strong loyalty from our customers 
we have successfully expanded our mccormick schmick s seafood restaurant concept throughout the united states and have competed effectively with both national and regional restaurant chains as well as with local operators 
we opened three  nine and seven company owned restaurants in  and  respectively  and entered into a management contract for one restaurant in  growing from to restaurants during this three year period 
our objective is to continue to prudently grow mccormick schmick s seafood restaurants in existing and new markets 
our plan includes the opening of eight new restaurants 
in addition to new unit growth  we are committed to improving comparable restaurant sales over the levels achieved in by driving increased guest counts as well as restaurant level operating margins

critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are the following equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment consists primarily of restaurant equipment  furniture  fixtures and smallwares 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas  as amended  or the estimated useful life of the asset 
as discussed in sfas  the lease term includes any period covered by a renewal option where the renewal is reasonably assured because failure to renew the lease would impose an economic penalty to the lessee 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
estimated useful lives are generally as follows equipment to years  furniture and fixtures to years and leasehold improvements to years 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of these assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount 
table of contents by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in our most recent impairment evaluation for long lived assets  no additional impairment charge would have resulted even if there were a permanent reduction in revenues in our restaurants 
during  we recorded a loss on impairment of long lived assets in the amount of million 
the charge was related to the partial impairment of fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements at one restaurant 
this restaurant had experienced a decline in cash flows due to the location of the restaurant 
there were no impairments during or goodwill and other indefinite lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived assets resulted from our acquisition in by castle harlan partners iii  lp and bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co 
ii  lp goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
however  such assets must be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually 
we completed our most recent impairment test on balances as of december   and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other indefinite lived assets 
there were no impairments of goodwill or assets with indefinite lives in or in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimated future cash flows were projected using significant assumptions  including future revenues and expenses 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance liability we maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation  employee health  general liability  and property damage 
pursuant to those policies  we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents our ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions  and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes we have accounted for  and currently account for  income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  an evaluation is made of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of or all deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax asset will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carry forward period permitted by the tax law 
without sufficient taxable income to offset the deductible amounts and carry forwards  the related tax benefits will expire unused 
we have evaluated both positive and negative evidence in making a 
table of contents determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
measurement of deferred items is based on enacted tax laws
