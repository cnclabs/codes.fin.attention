item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative drugs 
we specialize in developing safer or more efficacious drugs for use in pain management  particularly in the area of opioid painkillers  which are sometimes referred to as narcotic painkillers 
according to ims health  sales for opioid painkillers in the united states exceeded billion in we incorporated in delaware in may our clinical pipeline consists of proprietary drug candidates 
we are currently developing two oral  small molecule drugs to treat patients who suffer from severe chronic pain  such as pain associated with advanced osteoarthritis and low back pain 
both of our novel drug candidates are currently in phase iii clinical trial programs remoxy  an abuse resistant version of long acting oxycodone  and oxytrex  a new oral opioid painkiller for the treatment of severe chronic pain 
in november  we and king announced a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize remoxy and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers 
king made an upfront cash payment of million to us at the closing of this strategic alliance in december we could also receive from king up to million in milestone payments in the course of clinical development of remoxy and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  king is also obligated to pay us up to million in payments based on the achievement of milestones in the course of clinical development of remoxy and other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
king is obligated to fund the commercialization expenses of  and has the exclusive right to market and sell  drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance 
king is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales of drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance  except as to the first billion in net sales of such drugs  for which the royalty is set at 
we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and through december   we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to continue to use significant cash resources in our operations for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 

table of contents product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
we focus all our research and development efforts on the research and development of opioid drugs for the treatment of pain 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  compensation contractor fees supplies other contractor fees generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
supplies generally include costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other generally includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 
our technology has been applied across our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development  of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to contract agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
expenses for clinical trials are incurred from planning through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that 
table of contents are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the clinical trial completes enrollment 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the clinical trial 
stock based compensation 
the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model  or black scholes to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  black scholes was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  changes to the assumptions used in black scholes may materially affect the fair value estimate 
after evaluating our option valuation policies and assumptions in light of current accounting standards related to employee stock options  we expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of our options 
revenue recognition 
in connection with our strategic alliance with king  we recognize program fee revenue and collaboration revenue 
program fee revenue is derived from the upfront payment from king and is recognized ratably over our estimate of the development period under the strategic alliance with king 
collaboration revenues from reimbursement of development expenses are recognized as costs are incurred that relate to the strategic alliance with king 
taxes 
we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense 
we have accumulated significant deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain of the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we fully offset the total deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we may in the future determine that some  or all  of our deferred tax assets will likely be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes in our statement of operations in that period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of the upfront fee were million in the fourth quarter of for recognition of the revenue for the period from the execution of the agreement in november to the end of we expect to recognize the remainder of the program fee ratably over our estimate of the development period under the strategic alliance with king 
revenues collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in the fourth quarter of  related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance from the execution of the agreement in november to the end of we did not have any corresponding collaboration revenue in 
table of contents we expect collaboration revenues to increase significantly in and beyond as compared to revenue recognized in in connection with future increases in our research and development activities for remoxy and other abuse resistant drug candidates and reimbursement of these expenses pursuant to the king agreement 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense decreased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial activity in as compared to this decrease was offset in part by increased formulation and development activities for remoxy and other preclinical activities as well as increased compensation related expenses 
we expect research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our development efforts 
we expect our development efforts to result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials  including our phase iii clinical trials of oxytrex  remoxy  and other abuse resistant drug candidates 
king is obligated to reimburse development expenses for remoxy and other abuse resistant drug candidates pursuant to our agreement 
also  we expect to continue other development efforts on our drug candidates 
the increase in research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in headcount and general corporate activities  offset in part by decreased non cash stock based compensation expense in as compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with precommercialization and commercialization activities for our product candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in yields on our investments in marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  in average balances of marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to increase during because we expect our average balance of our marketable securities to be higher in as compared to and we expect the yield on our marketable securities to be higher in as compared to years ended december  and research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  
table of contents clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in phase iii clinical trials activities for oxytrex  pti and remoxy as well as continued development activities for remoxy 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense 
interest income interest income increased to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in average balances of marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private securities offerings 
additionally  in december  we received a million program fee under our strategic alliance with king 
we intend to continue to use the proceeds from these offerings and from this program fee to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the december program fee received from king 
cash used in operating activities in both years related primarily to the funding of operating losses 
we may use cash in to pay certain alternative minimum taxes related to using either net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits to offset revenue stemming from the upfront payment from king 
our investing activities to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements used cash of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  other investing activities for both years consisted primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
net cash provided by financing was million in compared to million in in  we issued  shares of common stock at per share in a follow on public offering and received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses 
in  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s  using a shelf registration process under which we may offer to sell any combination of securities described in such registration statement in one or more offerings  up to a total dollar amount of million 
we have not sold any securities under this shelf registration statement 

table of contents we lease approximately  square feet of general office space 
in addition to office space  we also lease equipment pursuant to operating leases 
our leases expire at various dates through under the terms of our real property and equipment leases  annual minimum lease payments are as follows as of december  in thousands total future minimum lease payments we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of defined milestones  including clinical milestones 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
king is obligated to reimburse us for any of our milestone payments and royalty payments to durect corporation 
we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
while our cash requirements to fund our operations may be lower in the future than in the year ended december  due to the obligation of king under the strategic alliance to reimburse us for certain expenses  we expect our cash requirements to be significant in the future 
the amount and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately million 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of short term investments in corporate and government notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable  market rates of interest
