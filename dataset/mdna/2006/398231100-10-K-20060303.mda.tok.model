however  in the opinion of management  because of the relative magnitude of griffin s inventories and real estate assets  accounting methods and estimates related to those assets are critical to the preparation of griffin s consolidated financial statements

inventories in applying the principle of the lower of cost or market using the average cost method for nursery stock  management must estimate the future recoverability of certain parts of the inventory that have not matured as planned 
such estimates are based on the physical characteristics of the nursery stock in question and potential sales outlets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate mortgage debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
griffin s mortgage interest rates and related principal payment requirements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin did not have any variable rate debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended december  griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalents 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk
