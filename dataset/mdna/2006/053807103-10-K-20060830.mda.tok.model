item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year and  as a result  the fiscal years ended july  and july  contained weeks and the fiscal year ended july  contained weeks 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations that follow 
over the past several years  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  have fluctuated significantly 
for example  the us dollar has strengthened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal to fiscal  but has weakened against the euro by approximately from fiscal to fiscal when the stronger us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is a decrease  in us dollars  of reported results 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when this translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is 
table of contents excluded from results  it is referred to as constant dollars 
results including this translation impact are referred to as delivered dollars 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information such as income or expense items as adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as discussed above 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to gaap results 
management also uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
as further discussed in results of operations executive summary below  during the first quarter of fiscal  avnet completed the acquisition of memec group holdings limited memec  a global distributor that marketed and sold a portfolio of semiconductor devices from industry leading suppliers  in addition to providing customers with engineering expertise and design services 
memec recorded sales of billion in the twelve months prior to the july  close of the acquisition  which makes this avnet s largest acquisition to date based on sales 
the consideration paid for the memec acquisition consisted of stock and cash valued at approximately million  including transaction costs  plus the assumption of million of memec s net debt debt less cash acquired 
all but million of this acquired net debt was repaid upon the closing of the acquisition 
under the terms of the purchase  memec investors received million shares of avnet common stock plus million in cash 
the shares of avnet common stock were valued at per share  which represents the five day average stock price beginning two days before the acquisition announcement on april  within this md a  management occasionally discusses fiscal sales of avnet combined with the historical results of memec for the corresponding period 
although the memec acquisition is accounted for as a purchase business combination and  therefore  the results of memec are only included in avnet s results subsequent to the july  close of the acquisition  management believes that comparative analysis of fiscal financial results to fiscal  as if memec were a part of avnet s operations during fiscal  helps investors relate current year results to historical periods prior to the close of the acquisition 
management uses similar pro forma data to analyze performance for internal operational goal setting and performance management 
furthermore  the combined results of avnet and memec in prior periods provide one of the bases by which management evaluates its achievement of synergy targets resulting from the merger as discussed further herein 
in the discussion that follows  mention of avnet and memec or electronics marketing and memec combined data is referred to as pro forma combined results or pro forma basis 
analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
results of operations executive summary avnet s consolidated results for fiscal were significantly and positively impacted by the acquisition of memec and the reasonably strong business environment in the markets in which the company does business 
as a result  the company s consolidated sales grew by from fiscal to fiscal to a record billion 
sales growth over that period on a pro forma basis to include memec s fiscal sales was in reported dollars  or excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
electronic marketing s em sales for fiscal were up over fiscal to a record billion  and were up on a pro forma basis including memec in the prior period 
excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales on a pro forma basis were up 
all three regions within em saw strong year over year growth 
technology solutions ts sales for fiscal grew by as compared with fiscal to a record billion  and were up excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents avnet s ongoing focus on the management of operating costs and returns on capital has resulted in its highest level of operating profits  operating profit margin and returns on capital since before the multi year economic and industry downturn began in avnet s operating income was million  or of consolidated sales in fiscal  up basis points from in fiscal fiscal operating income was negatively impacted by expenses relating to i restructuring  integration and other costs resulting from the acquisition and integration of memec into avnet s existing business  ii actions taken following the divestitures of two small  non core ts businesses in the americas  certain cost cutting initiatives in the ts emea region and other actions  iii incremental stock based compensation expense resulting from the company s adoption of sfas r and modifications to stock compensation plans in fiscal  iv incremental amortization expense associated with amortizable intangible assets recorded in fiscal as a result of the memec acquisition  and v the net loss related to the divestiture of non core businesses  all of which are described further under the caption restructuring  integration and other charges 
the total of these costs amounted to million or of sales 
these restructuring and integration initiatives were part of the company s overall efforts to realize the synergies expected as a result of the memec acquisition and to achieve greater operational efficiency 
at the beginning of fiscal  management anticipated that approximately million of annualized operating expenses would be removed from the combined avnet and memec businesses once the integration of memec was completed 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had taken actions to remove approximately million of annualized operating expenses 
with gross profit margins declining during the first half of fiscal  but improving during the second half  the company s acquisition of memec and the reduction of ongoing operating costs have been key to the significant improvement in profitability 
the company also continued to improve its working capital velocity and  in particular  its inventory turns during fiscal as it continued to focus on improving its asset utilization 
operating efficiency and working capital management will remain a key focus of avnet s overall value based management initiatives and its efforts to continue to grow profitability and to increase return on capital at a faster rate than its growth in revenues 
it is difficult for the company  as a distributor  to forecast the material trends of the electronic component and computer products industry  aside from some of the normal seasonality discussed herein  because avnet does not typically have material forward looking information available from its customers and suppliers beyond approximately three to four months of forecast information 
as such  management relies on the publicly available information published by certain industry groups and other related analyses in evaluating its business plans in the longer term

table of contents avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal were a record billion  up billion  or  over fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
year over year growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of memec 
including memec s sales in fiscal on a pro forma basis  avnet s consolidated sales grew on a delivered us dollar basis and an estimated excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
management estimates that the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced year over year sales growth by approximately million 
as indicated in the table above  the year over year growth occurred in both operating groups and in all regions 
em recorded sales of billion in fiscal  up billion  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion 
including memec s sales in fiscal on a pro forma basis  em s fiscal sales grew as compared with the prior year in delivered us dollars and by approximately excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which management estimates reduced em s year over year sales growth by approximately million 
em americas continues to be em s largest region with sales of billion in fiscal  up billion  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
on a pro forma basis including memec s sales in the prior period  em americas fiscal sales grew as compared with fiscal em asia again posted the most significant growth in sales for em as its sales grew to a record billion as a result of the acquisition of memec and strong organic growth 
including memec s sales on a pro forma basis in the prior period  em asia s sales grew as compared with fiscal this growth yielded em asia s eighth consecutive record for annual sales 
the positive growth trend in asia was fairly consistent throughout the year with the last three quarters growing in excess of year over year on a pro forma basis 
em emea s sales were billion  up nearly million  or  as compared with fiscal on a pro forma basis including memec s sales in the prior period  em emea s sales were up on a delivered us dollar basis and up approximately excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
ts sales in fiscal were a record billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ts fiscal sales grew approximately over the prior year 
the americas region sales of billion again accounted for the majority of ts total sales as its sales grew million  or  as compared with fiscal ts emea recorded sales of billion in fiscal  up marginally as compared with sales of billion in fiscal similar to em  the ts operations in emea were negatively affected by the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ts emea s sales on a constant us dollar basis were up approximately in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
ts asia fiscal sales of million were up over fiscal as growth in sales of microprocessors were less robust than the growth that occurred in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above  primarily the acquisition of memec  em s sales grew to of avnet s consolidated sales  up from of consolidated sales in fiscal avnet s regional sales mix changed somewhat from the prior year as the americas and emea percentage of total consolidated sales declined by roughly basis points each and asia s percentage grew by four hundred basis points and now represents of avnet s consolidated sales 
sales in the americas still represent the majority of consolidated sales at  while emea s sales are of total sales 
the company s consolidated sales in fiscal were billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
on a per week basis  to normalize the impact of the extra week in fiscal due to the company s fiscal calendar  sales were up in fiscal as compared with fiscal fiscal sales grew by and at em and ts  respectively  as sales grew in all three global regions in which the company operates 
management estimates that the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million of the year over year growth in sales  million for em and million benefiting ts 
em s sales of billion in fiscal were up million  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion 
ts recorded sales of billion in fiscal  representing an increase of million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
ts sales growth was led by the americas which recorded sales growth of over in fiscal  primarily due to strong growth in sales of microprocessors and in the ts enterprise computing business 

table of contents gross profit and gross profit margins avnet s consolidated gross profit in fiscal was billion  which represents a gross profit margin of 
this compares with gross profit of billion and a gross profit margin of in fiscal the million increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase in sales as a result of the acquisition of memec 
the gross profit in fiscal includes charges totaling million  or of sales  to write down certain inventory due primarily to supplier terminations as a result of a strategic decision to exit certain product lines within em after an evaluation of the combined product lines of em and memec 
see restructuring integration and other charges for further discussion of these charges 
the company s margin is impacted by the mix of business between avnet s two operating groups as the computer product sales of ts typically yield lower gross profit margins  but also a lower capital investment  than the electronic component sales of em 
in addition  the sales mix by region also impacts avnet s consolidated margins as em asia s gross margins are typically lower than those in the americas and emea  but its expense to sales are lower and its working capital investment is also lower as compared with the other regions 
gross margin is also impacted by customer mix  product mix within each business group and region  the business environment and competitive factors 
as a result of these factors  gross profit margins declined in the first half of fiscal  but began to strengthen during the second half of the year as the company placed a heavy focus on improving gross margins 
another important metric measured by management is gross profit per average employee 
the increase in gross profit dollars and the synergies resulting from the acquisition and integration of memec combined to yield a record gross profit per average employee in fiscal of approximately  an improvement of approximately when compared with  per average employee in fiscal consolidated gross profit in fiscal was billion as compared with billion in fiscal gross profit margin in fiscal was  down from in fiscal the mix of business between avnet s two operating groups and the growth of em asia s business impacted the gross profit margin of the company as noted above and was the primary driver of the slight decline in gross profit margin year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses avnet s consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were billion  or of sales  in fiscal as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in sg a dollars over the prior year is a direct result of the expansion of the overall business following the acquisition of memec at the beginning of fiscal despite this increase in sg a expenses  the ratio of sg a expenses as a percentage of sales improved basis points over fiscal more importantly  the ratio of sg a expenses as a percentage of sales improved basis points over the fiscal ratio adjusted to include memec as if it had been part of avnet throughout fiscal the primary driver in the ratio improvement was the realization of synergies as a result of restructuring and integration actions taken in fiscal sg a expenses were also negatively impacted by incremental stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement and the initial recognition and subsequent amortization of intangible assets associated with the memec acquisition 
sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit in fiscal was as compared with on a pro forma basis in fiscal  representing a basis point year over year improvement 
each of the ratios mentioned has improved to its best annual level since before the industry and economic downturn began in fiscal the current year improvement in these key measures of operating leverage is largely a result of the actions taken in connection with the memec integration and the synergies realized from such actions see restructuring  integration and other charges in this md a for further discussion of the actions taken by the company 
at the beginning of fiscal  management anticipated that approximately million of annualized operating expenses would be removed from the combined avnet and memec businesses once the integration of memec was completed 
as of the end of fiscal  the company had taken actions to remove approximately million of annualized operating expenses 
in addition to cost savings realized through the integration of memec into avnet s business  management took actions in connection with recent divestures to further reduce operating expenses during fiscal see restructuring  integration and other charges in this 
table of contents md a for further discussion of the actions taken by the company and also continued its focus on operating efficiencies and cost savings through various value based management initiatives 
the first quarter of fiscal represented the first period in which the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the statement of operations 
the impact of adopting sfas r  coupled with additional compensation expense associated with increased grants under some of the company s non option  stock based compensation programs  resulted in million of incremental expense during fiscal when compared with fiscal the company identified a total of million of amortizable intangible assets associated with the memec acquisition 
the company allocated million of the memec purchase price to intangible assets associated with acquired customer relationships and million to intangible assets associated with the memec tradename 
the customer relationship asset has been assigned a life of ten years and the tradename asset has been assigned a life of two years 
the asset values will be amortized on a straight line basis over these identified lives 
during fiscal  the company recorded amortization expense of million associated with these intangible assets 
avnet s consolidated sg a expenses were billion  or of sales  in fiscal as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit of in fiscal represented a basis point improvement over the same ratio in fiscal the improvement in these metrics between fiscal and fiscal was a result of the company s restructuring efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted in fiscal by an increased level of corporate operating expenses  driven primarily by increased professional fees and related costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
partially offsetting the positive impacts of restructuring activities that occurred in prior years  the fiscal sg a expenses were negatively impacted by the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between fiscal and fiscal  which management estimates yielded an increase in fiscal costs of approximately million of fiscal sales and of fiscal gross profits 
restructuring  integration and other charges the company recorded a number of restructuring  integration and other charges during fiscal and there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal the fiscal restructuring  integration and other charges relate primarily to actions taken to integrate memec into the existing avnet business as well as actions taken in connection with recent divestitures  and other actions 
the fiscal charges relate primarily to the reorganization of operations in each of the three major regions of the world in which the company operates  generally taken in response to business conditions at the time of the charge and as part of the company s efforts to return to the profitability levels enjoyed by the business prior to the industry and economic downturn that commenced in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a more detailed summary of activity within the restructuring  integration and other charge accounts during the past three years

in addition  the company has incurred restructuring and other charges primarily relating to actions taken following the divestitures of two ts end user business lines in the americas region  certain cost reduction actions taken by ts in the emea region  and other items  which are discussed further under restructuring and other charges related to business line divestitures and other actions 
the restructuring  integration and other charges incurred for all of these activities totaled million pre tax including million recorded in cost of sales  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 
table of contents memec related restructuring  integration and other charges during fiscal  the acquired memec business was being integrated into the company s existing em operations in all three regions 
as a result of the acquisition integration efforts  the company established and approved plans to restructure certain of avnet s existing operations to accommodate the integration of memec into avnet 
the restructuring and other charges excluding integration charges discussed below incurred during fiscal related to the integration of memec totaled million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis

the charge for terminated inventory lines related to a strategic decision during the first half of fiscal to exit certain product lines within em in the americas 
the charge in the third quarter of fiscal was a result of similar strategic decisions made in the emea region 
the terminated lines were product lines that avnet management elected not to continue with the combined avnet and memec business 
as a result  management recorded a write down of the related inventory on hand to fair market value due to the lack of contractual return privileges when a line is terminated by avnet 
severance charges incurred during fiscal related to work force reductions of over personnel primarily in administrative and support functions in the emea and americas regions

the facility exit charges related to liabilities for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and the write down of leasehold improvements and other property  plant and equipment relating to the facilities being exited 
the facilities  which supported administrative and support functions  and some sales functions  were identified for consolidation based upon the termination of certain personnel discussed above and the relocation of other personnel into other existing avnet facilities 
the it related charges resulted from management s review of certain capitalized systems and hardware as part of the integration effort 
a substantial portion of this write off  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  relates to mainframe hardware that was scrapped due to the purchase of new  higher capacity hardware to handle the increased capacity needs with the addition of memec 
similarly  certain capitalized it assets were written off when they became redundant either to other acquired systems or new systems under development in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the acquisition of memec 
other charges in fiscal related primarily to certain other contractual obligations and contract termination charges 
of the million recorded to expense for the memec related restructuring activity during fiscal  million represented non cash asset write downs  which consisted primarily of the charge to cost of sales for inventory write downs and the write down of it and other fixed assets 
in addition  certain severance and lease liabilities in the amount of million were assumed by the buyer of the net assets of a small  non core em business in the emea region see loss on sale of business lines in this md a for further discussion 
the remaining memec related charges in fiscal of million required or will require the use of cash  of which million was paid during fiscal as of july   remaining memec related reserves related to the restructuring actions taken in fiscal totaled million  of which million related to severance reserves  the majority of which management expects to utilize by the end of fiscal  facility exit costs and other costs of million  the majority of which management expects to utilize by fiscal as a result of the memec acquisition and its subsequent integration into avnet  the company incurred integration costs during fiscal  which totaled million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis 
the integration costs  particularly in the first nine months of fiscal  related to incremental salary costs  primarily of memec personnel  who were retained following the close of the acquisition  solely to assist in the integration of memec s it systems  administrative and logistics operations 
table of contents into those of avnet 
generally  these identified personnel were retained for nine months or less following the close of the acquisition 
these personnel had no other meaningful day to day operational responsibilities outside of the integration efforts 
also included in integration costs are certain professional fees  travel  meeting  marketing and communication costs that were incrementally incurred solely related to the memec integration efforts 
professional fees included primarily consulting and legal advice associated with the efforts to merge the numerous legal entities that exist globally between the avnet and memec operations 
integration costs  along with restructuring and other charges  are presented separately from selling  general and administrative expenses 
all integration costs recorded in fiscal represent amounts incurred and paid during fiscal restructuring and other charges related to business line divestitures and other actions during the third quarter of fiscal  the company divested two of its end user business lines in ts americas see loss on sales of business lines in this md a for further discussion 
as a result  restructuring charges were incurred due to certain actions taken by the company following these divestitures 
the company also incurred restructuring costs and other charges relating to certain cost cutting measures and other actions taken by ts in the emea region and certain actions at corporate in fiscal the restructuring and other charges incurred during the fiscal related to these actions totaled million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis 
the year to date pre tax charges  which are included in restructuring  integration and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  consisted of severance costs of million related to ts operations in the americas and emea regions  facility exit costs in the americas and emea regions totaling million  and million for other charges

the severance costs related primarily to severance and other termination benefit payments related to personnel in the ts americas operations who were rendered redundant in avnet s ongoing business following the divestiture of the end user business lines during the third quarter of fiscal this included two management level employees whose primary responsibilities previously included the management of the divested business lines 
severance charges in fiscal also included termination benefits for over personnel in the ts emea operations who were identified as redundant based upon the realignment of certain job functions in that region and two corporate management level employees 
the facility exit charges related to liabilities for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and the write down of facility related property  plant and equipment 
the impacted facilities were ts leased facilities in the americas that were rendered redundant with the divestitures discussed above  as well as certain ts leased facilities in emea that were vacated as part of the realignments of personnel discussed above 
certain furniture  fixtures and equipment in these facilities were also written off as part of these charges 
other charges in fiscal related primarily to asset impairment charges recorded in the second quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal totaling million for two owned but vacant facilities and certain related fixed assets one in emea and one in the americas 
the write down to fair value was based upon management s estimates of the current market values and possible selling price  net of selling costs  for these properties 
also included in other charges is the pension plan curtailment charge and environmental liability charge noted previously 
of the million recorded to expense for these restructuring and other charges during fiscal  million represented non cash asset write downs  which consisted primarily of the write down to fair value of the owned facilities in emea and the americas and certain furniture  fixtures and equipment in leased facilities 
the remaining charges in fiscal  amounting to million  required or will require the use of cash  of which million was paid during fiscal as of july   remaining reserves related to the non memec related restructuring activities taken in fiscal totaled million  of which million related to severance reserves  the majority of which management expects to utilize by fiscal  facility exit costs of million  the majority of which 
table of contents management expects to utilize by fiscal  and other costs of million  the majority of which management expects to utilize by fiscal while the above charges related to avnet personnel  facilities and operations  and are therefore recorded through avnet s consolidated statements of operations as restructuring  integration and other charges  the company also recorded numerous purchase accounting adjustments during fiscal related to the acquired personnel and operations of memec 
these adjustments were generally recorded as part of the allocation of purchase price and  therefore  were not recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  the company established and approved plans to integrate the acquired operations into all three regions of the company s em operations  for which the company recorded million in exit related purchase accounting adjustments 
these purchase accounting adjustments consist primarily of million for severance for memec workforce reductions of over personnel including senior management  administrative  finance and certain operational functions primarily in the americas and emea  million for lease and other contract termination costs  and million for remaining commitments and termination charges related to other contractual commitments of memec that will no longer be of use in the combined business 
of these exit related purchase accounting adjustments recorded in the fiscal  million was paid out in cash during fiscal and million were non cash write downs  leaving million of remaining reserves including million due to the translation impact of foreign currency exchange since the reserves were established  primarily related to severance  which are expected to be substantially paid out by the end of fiscal  and lease and other contractual commitment reserves  for which payments will extend into fiscal fiscal although there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal  the company recorded certain adjustments to reserves totaling million during fiscal  which were recorded through selling  general and administrative expenses 
the adjustments related primarily to the reversal of certain excess legal expense reserves associated with finalization of termination payments and reversal of excess severance reserves  offset in part by additional severance costs recorded based upon revised estimates of required payouts 
the company also reduced certain lease reserves due to modification to sublease and termination assumptions based upon ongoing market conditions 
fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company executed certain restructuring and cost reduction initiatives designed to continue improving the profitability of the company 
these actions can generally be broken into three categories the combination of the company s former computer marketing cm and applied computing ac segments into one computer products and services business called technology solutions ts  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  the reorganization of the company s global it resources  which had previously been administered generally on a separate basis within each of the company s operating groups  and various other reductions within em and certain centralized support functions 
restructuring and other charges incurred during the first quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the pre tax charge consisted of severance costs million  charges related to consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items  consisting primarily of the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the company s multi year credit facility terminated in september million 
severance costs resulted from workforce reductions of approximately personnel completed during the first quarter  primarily in executive  support and other non customer facing functions in the americas and emea regions 
management also identified a number of facilities for consolidation primarily in the americas and emea regions 
these facilities generally related to certain logistics and warehousing operations as well as certain administrative facilities across both operating groups and at the corporate level 
the charges related to 
table of contents reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these facilities that have been vacated 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that  in light of recent business restructurings  no longer met the company s return on investment standards for continued use or deployment 
these charges related to write offs of capitalized hardware and software 
restructuring charges incurred during the second quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charges consisted of severance costs million  charges related to write downs of owned assets and consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items million 
severance charges related to workforce reductions of approximately personnel  the majority of whom staffed warehousing  administrative and support functions primarily for facilities within ts emea operations that were identified for consolidation as part of the combination of cm and ac 
a smaller portion of these charges also impacted operations in the americas 
the combination of cm and ac in emea also led to charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in the facilities that were vacated 
the facilities were primarily used for warehousing and administrative offices 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives similar to the decisions also reached in the first quarter of fiscal as discussed above 
these charges related to the write off of capitalized hardware and software 
lastly  the company s efforts to combine cm and ac in emea resulted in the decision to merge the former cm emea operations onto the computer systems that have historically been used in the ac emea business 
the change in the use of this significant asset of cm emea generated a need to analyze the group of long lived assets within the former cm emea operations for impairment 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge to write down certain long lived assets to their estimated fair market values 
this charge  totaling million  of which million relates to the cm emea computer systems that were disposed of  is included in the facilities and it related charges discussed above 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of management s ongoing analysis of the reserves for various restructuring activities  the company recorded adjustments to certain of its remaining reserves 
the adjustments occurred primarily in the company s em and ts operations in emea and related to adjustments to reduce excess severance reserves based upon revised estimates of statutorily required payouts and recording of additional charges related to leased facilities due to modifications to sublease and termination assumptions based upon ongoing market conditions 
the company also negotiated a favorable buyout of a hardware and software maintenance contract  which resulted in the reversal of certain it related reserves 
the net amount of these adjustments was less than million 
the combined charges recorded during fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per diluted share 
approximately million of these pre tax charges required the use of cash with the remaining million representing non cash write downs as discussed in greater detail above 
total remaining reserves related to these prior year restructuring charges were million at the end of fiscal included in these remaining reserves are million for severance costs  the majority of which management expects to utilize by the end of fiscal the remaining reserve balance also included million for remaining facility contractual lease commitments  the majority of which will be utilized by the end of fiscal  although a small portion of the remaining reserves relate to lease payouts that extend to fiscal finally  there were million of other reserves  related primarily to remaining contractual commitments  the majority of which the company expects to utilize during fiscal loss on sale of business lines  net during fiscal  the company divested two ts end user business lines in the americas and two em specialty business lines in emea 
in ts  the company sold its americas end user server and storage business line to a value added reseller 
the company also contributed cash and certain operating assets and liabilities of its ts americas end user network solutions business into a joint venture with calence inc in exchange for an investment interest in the joint venture  called calence llc 
as a result of these divestitures  
table of contents a gain of million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in em  the company sold two small  non core business lines in its emea region during the fourth quarter of fiscal for which no tax benefit was available and  as a result  recorded a loss of million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis 
the total impact of these divestitures in fiscal was a loss of million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales  as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal operating income dollars increased over the prior year largely as a result of the memec acquisition 
on a pro forma combined basis  operating income in fiscal was million  or of pro forma combined sales 
the margin and operating expense trends discussed previously in this md a contributed to the operating income performance improvement over prior year 
operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by a total of million of consolidated sales for charges previously described 
see table in net income for a detail of these charges 
see also restructuring  integration and other charges  selling  general and administrative expenses and loss on sale of business lines  net for further discussion of these charges 
em reported operating income of million of em sales in fiscal as compared with operating income of million of em sales in the prior year 
on a pro forma combined basis  operating income in the prior year was million  or of em s pro forma combined sales 
the basis point year over year improvement in operating income margin basis points on a pro forma combined basis reflects increased volume resulting from the memec acquisition and the synergies created from the successful integration of the combined businesses 
operating income at ts was million of ts sales as compared with operating income of million of ts sales in fiscal the improvement in ts operating profitability in fiscal was driven by continued focus on profitable relationships and managing ongoing operating costs 
operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales  as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by the restructuring and other charges discussed above  which totaled million  or of sales  in fiscal the significant growth of operating income in both dollars and as a percentage of sales is a function of the moderate increase in consolidated sales between the two fiscal years and the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses discussed previously in this md a 
interest expense and other income interest expense was million in fiscal  up million  or  from interest expense of million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is a result of rising short term interest rates and higher borrowings on the company s various bank credit facilities 
the increase in short term interest rates that rose during fiscal resulted in the company s fair value hedges paying interest at a higher rate 
the increased borrowings are a direct result of certain cash expended for the acquisition of memec in the first quarter of fiscal  cash payments for other charges in fiscal and working capital needs see liquidity and capital resources cash flow for further discussion 
the factors driving interest expense up are offset partially by the favorable impact of the company s issuance of million of notes due september  the notes and repurchase of million of the company s higher rate notes due november  the notes during the first quarter of fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal  down million  or  as compared with interest expense of million in fiscal the reduction in interest expense year over year is due to a combination of reduced total debt outstanding and a lower effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings 
as further described below  the company has used cash and new financings to further repay outstanding debt obligations 
as a result of these actions  the company s total debt outstanding at july  was billion and the average debt outstanding during fiscal was approximately billion 
this is down from total 
table of contents debt outstanding at the end of fiscal and an average debt balance during fiscal of billion and billion  respectively 
the company s overall effective interest rate also declined as a result of two actions 
first  the company repaid in cash  at maturity  its million notes due march  these notes were outstanding for nearly three quarters of fiscal with no comparable interest expense in fiscal additionally  the company paid off million of its notes due february  with the proceeds from its convertible debentures due march   which were issued in march this resulted in a substantial decrease in effective rates between these two obligations year over year 
the remaining million of the notes were paid off in cash at their maturity date during the third quarter of fiscal  which eliminated the remaining interest expense on the notes for the remainder of fiscal these positive impacts on the company s effective interest rate were offset  in part  by short term interest rates that rose throughout fiscal  which results in the company s fair value hedges paying interest at a higher rate 
specifically  from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  the interest rates on the company s million hedge of its notes and million hedge of its notes due february  the notes each rose by approximately basis points 
other income  net  in fiscal was million as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal results included higher rate interest income earned on normal cash balances partially offset by foreign currency losses 
the interest income in fiscal also included approximately million earned on the investment of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes during the four week tender period for the notes discussed above 
fiscal and fiscal both contained foreign currency losses which offset a portion of the interest income earned in the respective years on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances 
debt extinguishment costs as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs in fiscal and associated with the tender and early repurchase of a portion of its outstanding publicly traded debt 
in completing these transactions  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs  related primarily to premiums and other transaction costs associated with these tenders and early repurchases  which totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal  and million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal income tax provision avnet s effective tax rate on its income before taxes for fiscal was as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective rate is primarily a function of a loss on the sale of a small  non core em business in the emea region for which no tax benefit was available and additional contingency reserves due to the recognition of tax exposures in the emea and asia regions  partially offset by a favorable settlement of a european audit 
excluding these items  the effective tax rate would have been lower than the us federal tax rate for fiscal as a result of varying statutory tax rates across the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in fiscal and fiscal  continuing improvement in profitability  particularly in the emea and asia regions  led to effective tax rates substantially lower than the us federal tax rate 
net income as a result of the factors described in the preceding sections of this md a  the company s net income was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal compared with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal and net income of million  or 
table of contents per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal the fiscal results were negatively impacted by a total of million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis  as detailed in the following table 
year ended july  gross operating pre tax net diluted profit income income income eps in thousands  except per share data restructuring  integration and other charges primarily memec acquisition related restructuring and other costs related to business divestitures and other actions stock based compensation expense incremental amortization expense for intangible assets loss on sale of business lines  net debt extinguishment costs total the fiscal results include the negative after tax impact of restructuring and other charges and debt extinguishment costs  discussed previously in this md a  totaling million  or per share on a diluted basis 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of 
table of contents return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s judgments and estimates of probable future tax liabilities 
as these estimates are highly judgmental  there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record impairment charges to goodwill 
contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments or a change in circumstances 
changes to reserves could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 
the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility 
table of contents is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized to income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

as a result of the adoption of sfas r  the company recognized pre tax charges of million in fiscal associated with the expensing of stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity 
additionally  the company increased its grant activity under other stock based compensation programs while decreasing the number of options granted that have always been expensed in the company s consolidated statements of operations  which yielded incremental expense under these other programs amounting to million when compared with fiscal in fiscal  the combination of these two changes resulting from the adoption of sfas r resulted in incremental expenses of million pre tax included in selling  general and administrative expenses  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes the company s cash flow activities for fiscal  and  including the company s computation of free cash flow and a reconciliation of this metric to the nearest gaap measures of net income and net cash flow from operations 
management s computation of free cash flow consists of net cash flow from operations plus cash flows generated from or used for purchases and sales of property  plant and equipment  acquisitions and divestitures of operations and investments  effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities 
management believes that the non gaap metric of free cash flow is a useful measure to help management and investors better assess and understand the company s operating performance and sources and uses of cash 
management also believes the analysis of free cash flow assists in identifying underlying trends in the business 
computations of free cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  the analysis of free cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  the company s consolidated statements of cash flows presented in the accompanying financial statements appearing in item of this report 
management also analyzes cash flow from operations based upon its three primary components noted in the table below net income  non cash and other reconciling items and cash flow generated from or used for working capital 
similar to free cash flow  management believes that this breakout is an important measure to help management and investors understand the trends in the company s cash flows  including the impact of management s focus on asset utilization and efficiency through its management of the net balance of receivables  inventories and accounts payable 
years ended july  july  july  thousands net income non cash and other reconciling items cash flow used for generated from working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents net cash flow used for provided by operations cash flow generated from used for purchases of property  plant and equipment cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment acquisitions and divestitures of operations and investments  net effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents other  net financing activities net free cash flow repayment of debt  net net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents non cash and other reconciling items are the combination of depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  non cash restructuring and other charges  and other  net  primarily the provision for doubtful accounts and  in the case of fiscal  stock based compensation expense in cash flows from operations 
cash flow from working capital is the combination of the changes in the company s working capital and other balance sheet accounts in cash flows from operations receivables  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other  net 

table of contents the company utilized million of cash and cash equivalents for working capital needs in fiscal the working capital outflows consist of growth in receivables million  growth in inventory million  net cash inflow from accounts payable million and outflow for other working capital items million 
the driver of the change in working capital includes organic sales growth and a small investment in inventory at ts in preparation for the seasonally stronger september quarter that ts typically experiences 
in addition  the company paid million during fiscal relating to restructuring  integration and payments of amounts accrued in purchase accounting associated with the memec acquisition  and restructuring and other costs as a result of the sale of two ts business lines and other actions taken during fiscal see results of operations restructuring  integration and other charges discussed elsewhere in this md a 
the company also made an accelerated contribution to the company s pension plan during the first quarter of fiscal  totaling million and used million primarily for premiums  transaction costs and other costs associated with the refinancing and repurchasing of its notes and credit facilities see financing transactions 
the cash flows associated with investing activities included capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily related to certain information technology hardware and software purchases  a new mainframe purchase and the ongoing development of one additional operating system to replace one of the systems that was disposed of as part of the restructuring  integration and other charges see results of operations restructuring  integration and other charges for further discussion 
also included in cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal is million for acquisitions and investments net of divestitures which relate primarily to the following million associated with the company s acquisition of memec  including the retirement of substantially all of memec s debt at the time of the acquisition see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  million cash contribution to the calence  llc joint venture  and million for the purchase of shares held by a minority interest holder in one of the company s israeli subsidiaries  an additional earn out payment associated with a small acquisition completed in fiscal and other items  net of cash inflow of million relating to the divestiture of the ts end user business lines during the third quarter and em business lines during the fourth quarter of fiscal finally  the cash inflows from other net financing activities related primarily to cash received for stock option exercises 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the company utilized free cash flow of million in fiscal along with million related to net debt repurchases 
avnet generated million of net cash flows from operations during fiscal this positive cash flow was largely driven by the company s improved profitability in fiscal  as further discussed in results of operations in this md a  and the generation of cash from its working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents 
management has continued to focus on improving asset utilization and efficiency since the economic and industry downturn that began in fiscal this focus was enhanced again in fiscal as the company weathered the mid cycle inventory correction in the electronic components sector 
the company s efforts to manage the combined balance of accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from these working capital components of million in fiscal a significant catalyst for this cash flow was the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels throughout its business 
as discussed in results of operations  em achieved record quarterly inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a direct result of this effort 
the cash flows associated with purchases and sales of property  plant and equipment remained relatively consistent in fiscal when compared with prior years 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of operations relate to the first quarter fiscal acquisition of dns slovakia  a small computer product distributor  as well as certain legal and other costs incurred in fiscal related to the acquisition of memec  which did not close until after fiscal trends in foreign currency exchange rates shifted in fiscal to generate a net cash outflow as most foreign currencies  particularly the euro  weakened slightly against the us dollar in the second half of fiscal this negative cash flow results from the translation of avnet s cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies  which were generally higher throughout the second half of fiscal resulting largely from the combination of the company s higher profitability and working capital management as it emerged from the mid cycle inventory correction 
the combination of these factors yielded net free cash flow in fiscal of million  of which the company utilized million for repayment of debt see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions 

table of contents during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities 
a return to profitability in fiscal plus the impacts of non cash and other reconciling items combined to yield cash inflows for fiscal of million 
partially offsetting this amount were cash flows of million used for the company s working capital needs excluding cash and cash equivalents during fiscal the primary driver of this outflow relate to the growth of receivables million and inventory million  net of cash flow generation from accounts payable million and other working capital items million 
these trends in working capital are typical of an up cycle in the electronic components industry as growth in receivables and payables is driven by higher sales and purchasing volumes 
additionally  inventory growth was also expected as the industry moved into an up cycle  especially in the electronic components sector where longer lead times from suppliers and increased demand from customers typically result in the distributor carrying higher levels of inventory 
as a result  em grew inventory in certain products to accommodate the growing levels in demand and in support of customer contractual agreements to purchase certain inventory 
therefore  it is not uncommon to see cash outflows associated with working capital when the company is in the growth phase of an up cycle 
despite the overall increase  the company continued to manage its working capital utilization and efficiency 
within em  where the majority of the inventory increases took place  fiscal inventory turns improved by over fiscal this improvement in turns was driven by a combination of the increased sales and the buildup of inventory only in high demand  and thus  higher volume product lines 
since the industry and economic downturn commenced in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company had significantly reduced its capital expenditures as well as its acquisition and investment activity 
however  during fiscal  the company completed a contingent purchase price payment associated with its january acquisition of of the stock of eurotronics bv  which went to market as sei 
pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement  in fiscal  avnet paid million to former shareholders of eurotronics bv in final settlement of contingent consideration related to this acquisition 
this coupled with other  less significant contingent purchase price payments and the acquisition of a minority interest in one of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in total cash outflow for acquisitions and investments of million during fiscal these outflows for investing activities  offset in part by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities  yielded a net free cash flow of million 
this net free cash flow  coupled with the cash usage for the company s retirement  both early and at maturity  of certain of the company s debt net of proceeds from new debt issued during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  resulted in a net decrease in cash during fiscal of million 
capital structure the company uses a variety of financing arrangements  both short term and long term  to fund its operations 
the company also uses diversified sources of funding so that it does not become overly dependent on one source and to achieve lower cost of funding through these different alternatives 
these financing arrangements include public bonds  short term and long term bank loans and an accounts receivable securitization program 
for a detailed description of the company s external financing arrangements outstanding at july   please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s capital structure as of the end of fiscal with a comparison with the end of fiscal july  of total july  of total capitalization capitalization dollars in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt shareholders equity total capitalization long term debt in the above table includes a fair value adjustment decreasing total debt and capitalization by million in fiscal and increasing total debt and capitalization by million at july  the fair value adjustment relates to the interest rate hedges on the company s notes in fiscal and relates to both the notes and notes in fiscal as discussed in financing transactions 
the capitalization as of july  also reflects the impact of approximately million shares of avnet common stock issued to the former owners of memec as part of the acquisition of memec 
the impact on the company s consolidated shareholders equity related to this issuance is million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion

at july   the company had two interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million in order to hedge the change in fair value of the notes related to fluctuations in interest rates 
these contracts were classified as fair value hedges with a november maturity date 
the interest rate swaps modified the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed rate on the notes to a floating rate at july  based on three month us libor plus a spread through their maturities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company terminated the interest rate swaps which hedged the notes due to the repurchase of million of the million notes  as previously discussed 
the termination of the swaps resulted in net proceeds to the company  of which  million was netted in debt extinguishment costs in the first quarter of fiscal based on the pro rata portion of the notes that were repurchased

at july   the securitization program qualified for sale treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
there were no receivables sold under the program at july  in august  the company amended securitization program to  among other things  increase the maximum available for borrowing from million to million 
the availability for financing under the amended facility is dependent on the level of the company s trade receivables from month to month 
in addition  the securitization program  as amended  no longer qualifies as off balance sheet financing 
as a result  the receivables and related debt will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet as amounts are drawn on the securitization program 
the purpose of the securitization program is to provide the company with an additional source of liquidity at interest rates more favorable than it could receive through other forms of financing 
the securitization program  as amended  has a one year term and has been renewed on substantially similar terms so that it currently terminates in august as of july   there was million of drawings on the securitization program 
covenants and conditions the securitization program agreement discussed above required the company to maintain senior unsecured credit ratings above certain minimum ratings triggers in order to continue utilizing the securitization program 
these minimum ratings triggers were ba by moody s investor services or bb by standard poors 
the minimum ratings triggers were eliminated in the amended securitization program discussed in off balance sheet arrangements and replaced with minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios as defined in the credit facility see discussion below 
the securitization program agreement in effect at july   as well as the amended securitization program agreement also contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds and the financial institutions may consider this an amortization event  as defined in the agreements  which would permit the financial institutions to liquidate the accounts receivable sold to cover any outstanding borrowings 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required covenants and conditions of the agreements include the company s ongoing profitability and various other economic  market and industry factors 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the program at july  the credit facility discussed in financing transactions contains certain covenants with various limitations on debt incurrence  dividends  investments and capital expenditures and also includes financial covenants requiring the company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios  as defined 
management does not believe that the covenants in the credit facility limit the company s ability to pursue its intended business strategy or future financing needs 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of july  see liquidity for further discussion of the company s availability under these various facilities 

table of contents liquidity the company had total borrowing capacity of million at july  under the credit facility and the securitization program  against which million in letters of credit were issued under the credit facility as of july   and a combined million was drawn under both the credit facility and the securitization program  resulting in million of net availability 
the company also had an additional million of cash and cash equivalents at july  there are no significant financial commitments of the company outside of normal debt and lease maturities as disclosed in long term contractual obligations 
management believes that avnet s borrowing capacity  its cash availability and the company s expected ability to generate operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected financing needs 
as discussed more fully in cash flows  the company is less likely to generate positive cash flows from working capital reductions during an up cycle in the electronic components and computer products industry 
however  additional cash requirements for working capital are generally expected to be offset by the operating cash flows generated by the company s enhanced profitability as avnet fully realizes operating expense synergies following the integration of the memec acquired business 
furthermore  during fiscal  the company repurchased a total of million of the million notes due november which was funded primarily with proceeds from the lower interest rate million notes due september the company also repurchased million of the million notes  which mature in february the company funded the repurchase primarily with cash on hand 
the following table highlights the company s liquidity and related ratios for the past two years comparative analysis liquidity years ended percentage july  july  change dollars in millions current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total capital total debt plus total shareholders equity quick ratio working capital ratio debt to total capital as discussed in cash flow  during fiscal  the company utilized approximately million for a number of notable transactions  including the acquisition of memec  accelerated contributions to the company s pension plan  cash used in connection with the repurchase of the company s and notes  cash used for the acquisition of the minority interest in avnet s israeli subsidiary and other items  net cash proceeds from the sale of the ts and em business lines and the equity investment in calence  and cash payments made related to restructuring charges and integration costs and other reserves recorded through purchase accounting 
the company s quick assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents and receivables increased from july  to july  as a result of the memec acquisition  offset in part by the cash usage discussed above 
in addition to factors that impacted quick assets  the increase in current assets was also impacted by the increase in inventory and receivables primarily due to expanded business volume associated with the acquisition of memec 
current liabilities grew from july  specifically  the company retained one of memec s short term borrowing facilities in japan  and in addition to this  the company increased borrowings on its bank credit facilities to fund working capital requirements and repurchase long term debt see financing transactions 
these items and the november maturity status of the remaining million of the notes  account for the increase in short term borrowings since fiscal year end 
current liabilities  also increased as a result of the memec acquisition and the corresponding growth in the size of avnet s business  the increase in accounts payable see discussion in cash 
table of contents flow and the increase in reserves for restructuring and purchase accounting established during fiscal see discussion in results of operations restructuring  integration and other charges 
as a result of the factors noted above  total working capital decreased by approximately during fiscal total capital grew primarily due to the million shares of avnet common stock granted to memec s former shareholders in connection with the acquisition and the increase in retained earnings by million of net income 
this corresponding million growth in equity is also the primary reason for the company s debt to capital ratio dropping from at july  to at july   as the company paid off the majority of memec s outstanding debt as part of the close of the acquisition 
long term contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding as of july  in millions due in less due in due in due after total than year years years years long term debt  including amounts due within one year operating leases excludes the fair value adjustment of million at july  related to the two interest rate swaps outstanding on fixed rate debt instruments 
the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
at july   the company had two interest rate swaps outstanding under which the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding and interest rate swaps at july  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional amounts 
table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt and interest rate swaps at july  and july  dollars in millions carrying value at fair value at carrying value at fair value at july  july  july  july  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate libor libor average receive rate represents fair value of all fixed rate debt including hedged portions of the notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  from time to time  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at july  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
