item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived primarily from restaurant sales from company owned longhorn steakhouse  the capital grille  and bugaboo creek steak house restaurants 
the company also derives a small percentage of its total revenue from two company owned specialty restaurants and franchise revenues from three franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants 
cost of restaurant sales consists of food and beverage costs for all restaurants other than the franchised longhorn steakhouse restaurants in puerto rico 
operating expenses restaurants consist of other costs incurred by the company to operate its restaurants  including the cost of labor  advertising  operating supplies  rent and utilities 
depreciation and amortization restaurants includes the depreciation attributable to restaurant level capital expenditures 
the depreciation and amortization relating to non restaurant level capital expenditures is included in general and administrative expenses 
preopening costs include direct and incremental costs such as payroll  food and beverage costs  and trainer payroll and travel expenses incurred prior to opening of new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include restaurant supervision expenses  accounting  finance  management information systems and other administrative overhead related to support functions for company owned  joint venture  and franchise restaurant operations 
interest expense  net includes interest on capital lease obligations and amortization of loan issue costs partially offset by capitalized construction period interest and interest income 
minority interest consists of the partner s share of earnings in the three longhorn steakhouse restaurants that are operated as joint venture restaurants 
the company s management believes in the importance of building incremental top line sales at each restaurant to support the longer term profitability of the company 
the change in year over year sales for the comparable restaurant base is referred to as same store sales 
the company defines the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full months prior to the beginning of each fiscal quarter 
same store sales increases can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts guest counts or by increases in guest average check amount average check 
the average check can be affected by menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold menu mix 
the company gathers sales data daily and regularly analyzes the guest counts and menu mix for each concept to assist in developing menu pricing  product offering and promotion strategies 
management believes that increases in guest counts are an indication of the long term health of a concept  while increases in average check and menu mix contribute more significantly to current period profitability 
the company works to balance the pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to achieve the long term goal of sustainable increases in same store sales 
average weekly sales are defined as total restaurant sales divided by restaurant weeks 
a restaurant week is one week during which a single restaurant is open  so that two restaurants open during the same week constitutes two restaurant weeks 
growth in average weekly sales includes the effect of newer restaurants that are not yet included in the same store sales base 
growth in average weekly sales in excess of growth in same store sales is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the system average 
conversely  growth in average weekly sales less than growth in same store sales is generally an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels lower than the system average 
it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normalized sales volumes and then to experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 
the incremental sales generated as a result of increases in same store sales make a significant contribution to the company s profitability through the leveraging of certain restaurant level expenses 
many restaurant level expenses are relatively fixed in nature and do not increase at the same rate as same store sales increases 
with sales increasing and certain restaurant level expenses staying fixed or semi variable rising more slowly than incremental sales  the incremental sales measured by these same store sales increases should be the company s most profitable 
when new restaurants are opened  there are preopening costs and certain relatively fixed costs including expense items such as management labor  rent and depreciation that must be absorbed 
additionally  it generally takes some period of time after opening before restaurant margins normalize 
accordingly  the sales at newly opened restaurants do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation 
the company s revenues and expenses can be affected significantly by the number and timing of the opening of additional restaurants 
for instance  preopening expenses for any particular period may reflect expenses associated with restaurants to be opened in future periods  in addition to those restaurants opened during the current period 
the timing of restaurant openings also can affect the average weekly sales and other period to period comparisons

effect of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on earnings during the past several years 
inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operations and increase menu prices to offset inflationary increases in its operating costs 
a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has generally been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in the minimum wage and in other costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  at least to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp is effective for the company s fiscal and requires the company to expense rental costs incurred during the construction period associated with ground or building operating leases 
the company has previously capitalized these costs 
retrospective application  which permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods is permitted but not required 
beginning effective for fiscal  the company intends to adopt the provisions of fsp using retrospective application 
this will result in the revision of previously issued financial statements as if the provisions of fsp had always been used 
management currently estimates that the adoption of fsp will result in a decrease of approximately in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal and approximately in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of awards of equity instruments granted in exchange for employee services received  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in their financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r was the first interim period beginning after june   however  on april   the sec announced that the effective date of sfas r was postponed until the first annual period beginning after june  sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas the company intends to adopt the provisions of sfas r using modified prospective application 
the company currently utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use this model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standards 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  compensation cost for stock options for which the requisite future service has not yet taken place is disclosed as a pro forma expense by applying the provisions of sfas the pro forma application of sfas had a dilutive effect of approximately per diluted share for compensation cost for stock options vesting beginning in fiscal  and all restricted stock  will be expensed in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  which will be effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal the company estimates that stock based compensation expense for fiscal will be approximately to million to million after tax or to per diluted share 
this estimate includes costs related to unvested stock options and restricted stock grants associated with new compensation programs 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb no 
fin 
asset retirement obligations are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal operation of a long lived asset 
fin clarifies that liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations whose timing or settlement method are conditional on future events should be recorded at fair value as soon as fair value is reasonably estimable 
fin also provides guidance on the information required to reasonably estimate the fair value of the liability 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of the impact of adoption was not material

 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
the company s accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated  the expected lease term for assets related to leased properties and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
lease accounting the company is obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurant facilities 
for operating leases  the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
capital leases are recorded as an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term 
under the provisions of certain of the company s leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the holidays and escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that the company will exercise such option periods due to the fact that the company would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments 
the leasehold improvements and property held under capital leases for each restaurant facility are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the same expected lease term used for lease accounting purposes 
for each restaurant facility  the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease term for amortizing leasehold improvements as the company uses to determine capital versus operating lease classifications and in calculating straight line rent expense 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is accrued at the point in time the company determines that it is probable that such sales levels will be achieved 
leasehold improvements paid for by the lessor are recorded as leasehold improvements and deferred rent 
judgments made by the company related to the probable term for each restaurant facility lease affect i the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  ii the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and iii the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  and fixed assets are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
expected cash flows associated with an asset is a key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the company s ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge 
in  the company recognized a million charge for the write down of asset values for three longhorn steakhouse restaurants and two bugaboo creek steak house restaurants 
in  the company recognized a million charge for the write down of asset values related to two longhorn steakhouse restaurants and one bugaboo creek steak house restaurant 
self insurance accruals the company self insures for a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation  employee medical  employment practices and general liability programs 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based on estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred  but unpaid  claims 
the accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include certain management judgments and assumptions regarding the frequency or severity of claims and claim development patterns  and claim reserve  management  and settlement practices 
unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for by the company in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company reviews and assesses the recoverability of any deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances as required 
an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
