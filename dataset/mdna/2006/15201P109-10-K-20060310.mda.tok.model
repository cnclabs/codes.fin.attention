executive summary our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of centerstate banks of florida  inc the parent company  and our wholly owned subsidiary banks and an owned subsidiary  c 
s 
processing 
our subsidiary banks operate through locations in seven counties throughout central florida  providing traditional deposit and lending products and services to its commercial and retail customers 
cs processing is an owned subsidiary  which provides item processing services for our subsidiary banks and the minority shareholder bank centerstate bank mid florida  which will be acquired in march which owns the remaining 
during january  we combined two of our four subsidiary banks  first national bank of polk county and centerstate bank of florida 
the combined bank operates under the name centerstate bank of florida  national association 
both banks operated in polk county  florida 
the two banks were geographically close and their market overlaps continued to grow 
the proximity of the two banks led to some confusion with customers and operating inefficiencies 
we expect any redundancy and over staffing to cure itself through attrition and company wide growth 
the combined bank  centerstate bank of florida  has twelve banking locations  all in polk county  florida 
we have no plans to combine any of our remaining banks 
with regard to our two other banks as of december   centerstate bank west florida cswfl operates through eight locations in pasco  citrus  hernando and sumter counties  and  first national bank of osceola county operates through six locations in osceola and orange counties 
on september  we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase centerstate bank mid florida mid fl for per share approximately 
the consideration is comprised of per share in cash and per share in our common stock pursuant to the agreement 
the bank has  common shares outstanding and options on approximately  additional shares at an average exercise price of approximately per share 
mid fl began operations in january in february  it purchased two branches from us 
currently  it operates from three locations in lake county  florida 
at december   it had total assets of approximately  and total stockholders equity of approximately  ernest s 
pinner is our chairman  president and ceo  and  he is also the chairman of the board of directors of mid fl 
james s 
stalnaker  jr 
is the president and ceo of cswfl one of our subsidiary banks  and  he is also a director of mid fl 
timothy a 
pierson is the president and ceo of mid fl 
prior to mr 
pierson s employment with mid fl  he worked for us as an executive vice president of one of our subsidiary banks 
mr 
pierson severed his ties with us when he accepted his employment position with mid fl 

table of contents this transaction is expected to close by the end of march subsequent to this transaction  we expect to be operating through four banks with locations in eight counties in central florida as summarized in the table below subsidiary banks no 
of locations counties first national bank of osceola fnb osceola osceola  orange centerstate bank west florida cswfl pasco  hernando  citrus  sumter centerstate bank of florida csb polk centerstate bank mid florida midfl lake during we completed construction on our lake wales branch office polk county  which was operating from a temporary facility since its opening in april we opened one new branch office during we opened this during october in a temporary facility in citrus county  and expect to construct a permanent facility during we also have several more branches planned for the next two years 
during  we also raised additional capital through a secondary public stock offering 
on june   we closed the sale of  shares of our common stock to several underwriters in a secondary public offering at a purchase price of per share 
on july   we closed the sale of an additional  shares of common stock which were subject to the over allotment option granted to the underwriters at per share 
we received net proceeds of  after underwriters discount  or per share and offering expenses of approximately  our company s principal asset is its ownership of the banks 
accordingly  our consolidated results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of the banks 
through our subsidiary banks  we conduct commercial banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
our profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and to a lesser extent commission earned on brokering single family home loans  and commissions earned on the sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments 
non interest expense consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and 
table of contents procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
a standardized loan grading system is utilized at each of our subsidiary banks 
the grading system is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers of each bank assign a loan grade to their newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to that particular bank s board of directors 
the company s loan review officer  who is independent of the lending function and is not an employee of any subsidiary bank  periodically reviews each bank s loan portfolio and lending relationships 
he may disagree with a particular bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
as such  our lending process is decentralized  but our credit review process is centralized 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that collateral dependent loans are generally measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
we consider loans graded or higher to be impaired 
deferred tax assets we use an estimate of future earnings to support the position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and net income will be reduced 
deferred tax assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting 
we acquired centerstate bank of florida  in winter haven  florida  on december  consequently  we were required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
in november  the required impairment testing of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date  as the fair value of our net assets exceeded their carrying value 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
stock based compensation we use accounting principle board opinion no 
and related interpretations to account for stock based compensation costs 
as such  we estimate the value of options that we grant using the fair value method and the black scholes option pricing model  and disclose this information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not recognize the estimated values as expense in our consolidated financial statements 
effective with our fiscal year beginning january   we will be required to recognize the estimated values of our stock option grants in our consolidated financial statements using the fair value method 
under the fair value method  stock option expense is measured on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with market assumptions 
option pricing models require the use of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  which when changed can materially affect fair value estimates 
accordingly  the model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock options 
sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  requires all public companies to record compensation cost for stock options provided to employees in return for employee service 
the cost is measured at the fair value of the options when granted  and this cost is expensed over the employee service period  which is the vesting period of the options 
this will apply to awards granted or modified after the first fiscal year beginning after june  compensation cost will also be recorded for prior option grants that vest after the date of adoption 
the effect on results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted at such future date  as well as the vesting periods provided

table of contents loans lending related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability 
the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets

renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio 
see liquidity and market risk management for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance consists of amounts reserved for specific loans that management believes may prove uncollectible and amounts generally reserved based on our historical loan loss experience 
the specific reserve element is the result of a regular analysis of all our loans and commitments based on credit rating classifications 
the general reserve element represents an assessment of potential credit problems and is determined based on loan loss experience of each loan type  general economic conditions  the risk characteristics of various classifications of our loans  credit records of our borrowers  the fair market value of underlying collateral and other factors 
we are committed to the early recognition of problems and to maintaining a sufficient allowance

we place loans on non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when we place a loan on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status 
at december  non accrual loans totaled  this consisted of an aggregate  in real estate related loans loans   in a mobile home loan loan   in a loan collateralized by inventory and accounts receivable loan  and several vehicle  equipment and other miscellaneous loans aggregating  loans

while we believe we use the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of our markets  and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change 
we continuously focuses our attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans  as they arise 
although the total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from all loans  management allocates the reserve among the general loan portfolio categories for informational and regulatory reporting purposes 
regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based upon the regulators judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examination  which may differ from our judgments about the allowance for loan losses

we did not have any of these types of transactions during corporate debenture we formed centerstate banks of florida statutory trust i the trust for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
on september   we issued a floating rate corporate debenture in the amount of million 
the trust used the proceeds from the issuance of a trust preferred security to acquire the corporate debenture of the company 
the trust preferred security essentially mirrors the corporate debenture  carrying a cumulative preferred dividend at a variable rate equal to the interest rate on the corporate debenture three month libor plus basis points 
the rate is subject to change quarterly 
the rate in effect during the quarter ended december  was

related loan origination costs of  were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over a five year period 
the company has treated the trust preferred security as tier capital up to the maximum amount allowed  and the remainder as tier capital for federal regulatory purposes 
securities we account for our investments at fair value and classifies them as available for sale 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end  and forecasted performance of the security 
if a security has a decline in fair value below its amortized cost that is other than temporary  then the security will be written down to its new cost basis by recording a loss in the statement of operations

see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 

table of contents we use our security portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  we remain short term under years in our decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
we have designated all of our securities as available for sale to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
we believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels 
the available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized loss of approximately  at december   compared to  at december  we invest primarily in direct obligations of the united states  obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the united states  mortgage backed securities and obligations of agencies of the united states

this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
we measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
while our liquidity monitoring and management considers both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity  the following table of contractual commitments focuses only on our future obligations

table of contents interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset liability management effort 
each of our banks  generally attempts to maintain a range  set by policy  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
each of our banks set their own range  approved by their board of directors 
generally  the range is between and 
if any of our banks fall outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval  by that particular bank s board of directors 
the asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
our gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals 
at december   approximately of total gross loans were adjustable rate and of total investments includes investment securities  federal funds sold and money market either reprice or mature in less than one year 
deposit liabilities consisted of approximately  in now accounts   in money market accounts and savings   in time deposits and  in non interest bearing demand accounts 
the table below presents the market risk associated with our financial instruments 
in the rate sensitivity analysis table  rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by maturity or repricing periods  separating fixed and variable interest rates 
the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on our judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if we had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates

capital resources total shareholders equity at december  was  or of total assets compared to  or of total assets at december  the  increase was primarily the result of the following items net proceeds received from our public stock offering  plus net income  plus exercise of stock options  less dividends paid  less net change of unrealized losses in securities available for sale 
the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
each of our company s subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on our company

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce our earnings from such activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than approved and unfunded loans and letters and lines of credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business

r  accounting for stock based compensation  requires all public companies to record compensation expense for stock options provided to employees in return for employee service 
the expense is measured at the fair value of the options when granted  and is expensed over the employee service period  which is the vesting period of the options 
this will apply to awards granted or modified beginning with the next fiscal year beginning after june  compensation expense will also be recorded for prior option grants that vest after the date of adoption 
the effect on results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted at such future date  as well as the vesting periods provided  and thus cannot currently be predicted 
options existing at december   that will vest after adoption date are expected to result in additional compensation expense of approximately  in and  in on september   the fasb decided to include in the draft final fasb staff position fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  guidance similar to that provided in eitf issue no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk for their specific bank 
substantially all of our interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of each of our subsidiary banks 
as such  the board of directors of each subsidiary bank is responsible to review and approve the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
