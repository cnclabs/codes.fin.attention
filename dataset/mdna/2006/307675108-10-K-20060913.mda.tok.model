item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and with the risk factors described in item of this report 
critical accounting policies overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  including lifo reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  liabilities relating to retirement benefits  liabilities resulting from self insurance of our workers compensation liabilities  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from these estimates  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
investments our investments consist of investment grade marketable debt instruments issued by the us government and major us and foreign corporations  equity securities  primarily preferred stock  and various derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded treasury futures and options  green coffee forward contracts and commodity purchase agreements 
all derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes where possible 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their obligations 
our ability to maintain a relatively small reserve is directly related to our ability to collect from our customers when our salespeople regularly interact with our customers in person 
this method of operation has provided us with a historically low bad debt experience 
there can be no assurance this will be the case in the future 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and the costs of coffee and allied products are determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
costs of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the first in  first out fifo basis 
we regularly evaluate these inventories to determine whether market conditions are correctly reflected in the recorded carrying value 
self insurance retention we are self insured for california workers compensation insurance and use historical analysis to determine and record the estimates of expected future expenses resulting from workers compensation claims 
additionally  we accrue for estimated losses not covered by insurance for liability  auto  medical and fire up to the deductible amounts 
retirement plans we have two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for the majority of our employees the balance of our employees are covered by union defined benefit plans 
we obtain actuarial valuations for both plans and at present we discount the pension obligations using a discount rate and we estimate an return on plan assets 
the performance of the stock market and other investments as well as the overall health of the economy can have a material effect on pension investment returns and these assumptions 
a change in these assumptions could affect our operating results 
our retiree medical plan is not funded and shares the same discount rate as the defined benefit plans 
we project an initial medical trend rate of ultimately reducing to in years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
estimating our tax liabilities involves judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we make certain estimates and judgments to determine tax expense for financial statement purposes as we evaluate the effect of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  some of which result from differences in timing of recognition of revenue or expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
changes to these estimates may result in significant changes to our tax provision in future periods 
each fiscal quarter we reevaluate our tax provision and reconsider our estimates and our assumptions related to specific tax assets and liabilities  making adjustments as circumstances change 
liquidity and capital resources we have been able to maintain a strong working capital position  and believe that our short and long term cash requirements will be provided by internal sources 
we do not expect to rely on banks or other third parties for our working capital needs 
our working capital is composed of the following june  in thousands current assets current liabilities working capital capital expenditures at june  we had no major commitments for new capital expenditures 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and overview management has a number of short and long term initiatives underway designed to strengthen the company s sales and distribution network and improve sales 
our efforts are focused primarily on enhancing our brand identification  expanding our product line and customer base and improving our sales and distribution efficiency 
our initiatives include promotion of our brand 
we have designed and ordered new packaging for our entire product line 
the updated designs employ the use of bright colors to better appeal to modern tastes 
the roll out for the new packaging is expected to begin in october we have designed  and are in the process of producing and distributing new point of sale marketing materials to help our customers increase sales of our products 
many of these materials were distributed to customers during fiscal and others will be distributed in connection with the new packaging roll out 
we are promoting our brand and product line in an expanded trade show schedule throughout our marketing area to highlight the new spirit our packaging represents 
introduction of new products 
during fiscal we developed a variety of new products designed to appeal to both new and existing customers  including horchata a sweet rice drink flavored with cinnamon and almond  fruit smoothies iced beverages  an expanded line of teas  liquid coffee and some seasonal products pumpkin pie cappuccino 
we believe these new products afford us with an opportunity to engage our customers and cross sell other products and share ideas for future new products 
expansion of customer base 
in an effort to expand our customer base we have created a national accounts organization to solicit larger customers and national accounts 
this group is currently comprised of professionals who are working from our existing branch facilities to reach potential customers throughout the country 
improved sales and distribution efficiency 
in an effort to cut costs and improve our sales and distribution efficiency we have evaluated our branches  routes and sales staff responsibilities 
in connection with these efforts we have reduced staffing and consolidated routes in certain areas  while increasing staffing in areas where we are experiencing growth 
during fiscal we expect to implement new route sales application software to further enhance our ability to evaluate customer  product and route profitability 
management continues to concentrate on improving our gross profit margins and controlling our selling and general and administrative expenses 
although we were able to maintain gross profit margins in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  inflationary pressures on the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies remains a threat to our ability to maintain these margins in the future 
despite efforts to reduce operating costs during fiscal  certain expenses are beyond our control  such as gasoline and diesel prices which directly impact our distribution costs 
moreover  during fiscal we also experienced an increase of approximately  in compensation expenses associated with the cost of the national accounts organization 
we continue to evaluate all departments in an effort to eliminate unnecessary procedures and staff and align needed staff skills to match business requirements through re training or new hires 
comparative information net sales in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal  primarily because of higher sales prices 
programs to enhance sales began during fiscal and continue to be deployed as discussed above 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal although we stabilized our margins in fiscal compared to fiscal  the volatility of green coffee prices  higher prices on a variety of raw materials and product packaging and strong competition have restricted our ability to return to previous gross profit margins 
we continue to seek alternative and competitive sources of raw materials  packaging supplies and other key cost components in an effort to improve our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
the average closing price of green coffee nearby contract for each of the last three fiscal years  as compiled by the new york board of trade  is presented in the following table 
comparison of average periodic green coffee prices twelve months ended june  average coffee price per pound change from prior year selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to higher coffee brewing equipment costs largely associated with new products  higher gasoline and diesel costs and increased california workers compensation expense  offset by declines in self insured employee medical costs  it project consulting costs and sox compliance consulting and auditing costs 
continuing development costs of our multi year information systems project are currently capitalized 
the new sales system implementation has been delayed and development costs associated with that project will begin depreciating in fiscal principal changes in selling  general and administrative expenses for year ended june  in thousands coffee brewing equipment self insured employee medical costs fuel costs workers compensation costs it project depreciation it project consulting sox compliance consulting auditing costs total other income expense in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of higher interest rates during fiscal and the reduction of losses associated with higher green coffee prices during the second quarter of fiscal which resulted in a decrease in the value of green coffee futures and options used by the company to hedge against a decline in commodity prices 
other  net expense during fiscal consisted of net realized and unrealized coffee trading losses of  offset by net gains on other investments 
as a result of the forgoing factors  net income for fiscal was  as compared to a net loss of  in fiscal net income per common share was in fiscal as compared to a net loss per common share of in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and net sales in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal  primarily because of higher sales prices of roast coffee 
during fiscal we initiated a number of programs intended to improve sales 
in an effort to advance our image more clearly and aggressively with current and potential customers we redesigned our merchandising and point of sale materials and set an aggressive trade show schedule with a newly designed booth 
we assembled a team of sales professionals drawn from the ranks of our route sales organization to solicit new large customer accounts 
we developed some new products that we believe will appeal to both new and existing customers 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal a volatile  sustained increase in green coffee prices in the second and third quarters of fiscal resulted in a decrease in profit margins on roast coffee during those periods 
we attempt to pass on this cost increase to our customers through higher roast coffee prices  but sales price increases lag increases in green coffee costs  and our sales price increases did not take effect until june additionally  volatile price increases cannot  because of competition and market conditions  always be passed on to our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributed to costs associated with the employee medical program  the cost of the esop  the project related costs of our multi year information systems project and consulting costs related to compliance with sox section as summarized in the following table

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market value risk arising from changes in interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our portfolio of investment grade money market instruments can include at any given time discount commercial paper  medium term notes  federal agency issues and treasury securities 
as of june   over of these funds were invested in us treasury securities and approximately of these issues have maturities shorter than days 
this portfolio s interest rate risk is not hedged and its average maturity is approximately days 
a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately  our portfolio of preferred securities includes investments in derivatives that provide a natural economic hedge of interest rate risk 
we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates 
we do not transact in futures contracts or put options for speculative purposes 
the following table demonstrates the impact of varying interest rate changes based on the preferred stock holdings  futures and options positions  and market yield and price relationships at june  this table is predicated on an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates and assumes predictable relationships between the prices of preferred securities holdings  the yields on us treasury securities and related futures and options 
the number and type of futures and options contracts entered into depends on  among other items  the specific maturity and issuer redemption provisions for each preferred stock held  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the expected volatility of us treasury yields  and the costs of using futures and or options 
market value at june  change in market preferred futures and total value of total interest rate changes securities options portfolio portfolio in thousands basis points basis points unchanged basis points basis points commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee 
we price our inventory on the lifo basis 
in the normal course of business we hold a large green coffee inventory and enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with suppliers 
we are subject to price risk resulting from the volatility of green coffee prices 
volatile price increases cannot  because of competition and market conditions  always be passed on to our customers 
from time to time the company will hold a mix of futures contracts and options to help hedge against volatile green coffee price decreases 
gains and losses on these derivative instruments are realized immediately in other  net expense income 
on june  we had no open hedge derivative contracts  and our entire exposure to commodity risk was in the potential change of our inventory value resulting from changes in the market price of green coffee
