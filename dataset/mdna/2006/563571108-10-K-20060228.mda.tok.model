year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in all three of our business segments reported increased sales in compared to sales in our crane  foodservice  and marine segments increased  and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in changes in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in sales of less than one percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the increases in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
gross margin decreased in to from in gross margin was negatively affected by a million reserve recorded in the marine segment during the fourth quarter of for a more detailed discussion of this reserve  please see the marine segment analysis below 
consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of over the consolidated gross profit for the same period in of million 
in addition to the impact of the marine segment reserve  comparative consolidated gross profit for the years ended december  and was affected by the following items i increased volumes in the crane and foodservice segments  ii favorable product mix and cost reductions implemented in recent years in the crane and foodservice segments  and iii production inefficiencies in the marine segment experienced during the completion of three specific new construction contracts during in addition  a significant amount of revenue in the marine segment for the third and fourth quarters of was from a first run prototype military vessel that is structured as a low margin cost plus contract 
engineering  selling and administrative expenses es a increased to million in compared to million in  which is a million increase 
as a percentage of sales  es a declined to in  compared to in approximately million of this increase is the result of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during as compared to the remaining increase in es a in compared to is a result of the following i increase in research and development costs in the crane and foodservice segments for product development  ii increases in enterprise resource planning erp costs and costs related to the creation of a domestic shared service function within the foodservice segment  and iii higher employee benefit costs in across all three segments and at the corporate office 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge within the foodservice segment of million in connection with the consolidation of our kolpak operation located in wisconsin with our kolpak operation located in tennessee 
this action was taken in an effort to streamline our cost structure and utilize available capacity 
this charge included million to write down the wisconsin facility and land  which are held for sale  to estimated fair market value less cost to sell  million related to the write down of certain equipment to its estimated fair market value  million to write off excess inventory which was not transferred to tennessee  million related to severance and other employee related costs  and million for other related closing costs 
this charge has been included in restructuring and plant consolidation costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december  this decrease is the result of lower average debt levels and a lower euro versus us dollar exchange rate in  partially offset by an increase during in the variable interest rate portion of outstanding debt balances 
during june  we recorded a charge of million million net of income taxes to write off deferred financing costs related to the termination of our previous million revolving credit facility 
in addition  on january   we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes due as a result of this redemption  we incurred a charge of approximately million million net of income taxes 
this charge related to the prepayment premium of million paid to the note holders and the partial write off of debt issuance costs of million 
both of these charges were recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate from continuing operations was compared to for the year ended december  the tax rate for was favorably affected as compared to the statutory rate by a research and development credit recorded during the second half of and certain global tax planning initiatives and fixed permanent book tax differences 
for the year ended december   earnings from discontinued operations represented the operating losses of toledo ship repair and the operating earnings of dri 
the gain on sale or closure of discontinued operations represented a million pre tax million after tax gain on the sale of dri and a million pre tax million after tax loss on the closure of toledo ship repair 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to approximately billion from billion in this was due to increased sales in all three of our business segments  which all reported higher net sales in than in sales in our crane segment increased in to billion 
the foodservice segment reported net sales for of million  a increase compared to the marine segment had net sales of million in compared to million in the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar positively affected net sales in by approximately million compared to further analysis of the increases in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
gross margin decreased in to from in gross profit of all three segments was negatively impacted by increased commodity prices  especially steel  during compared to consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of over the consolidated gross profit for the same period in of million 
in addition to the impact of the increased commodity prices  comparative consolidated gross profit for the years ended december  and was affected by the following items i increased volumes in all three segments in  ii a profitable repair season in the marine segment during the first part of  iii the favorable effects of integration savings  iv favorable product mix and cost reductions implemented in recent years in the foodservice segment  v lower margin commercial construction projects  and constructing of first time vessels at our shipyards  all of which negatively impacted our marine segment margins in  vi the effect of the strike at marinette marine corporation in the first quarter of  vii competitive pricing activities in certain regions and with certain products  and viii a strong euro in es a increased to in compared to million in  a million increase 
as a percentage of sales  es a decreased to in  compared to in approximately million of this increase is the result of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during as compared to research and development spending increased approximately million in the crane and foodservice segments for new product introductions 
the crane and foodservice segments introduced and new products  respectively  to their markets during as a result of the increased sales during  selling expenses increased approximately million in compared to corporate expenses increased approximately million in compared to this is primarily the result of a million expense for a sales and use tax settlement incurred in the first quarter of and costs associated with our compliance activities relating to the sarbanes oxley act of the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of higher employee benefit costs in all three segments and corporate 
amortization expense of million during increased over the million reported in this increase was the result of the strengthening of the euro to the us dollar 
restructuring expense of million for is attributable to restructuring in our crane segment in the amount of million and in our foodservice segment of million 
throughout  we continued certain restructuring activities within our crane segment to reduce our overall fixed cost structure 
the foodservice restructuring charge related to the closing of our manufacturing facility in italy 
after taking all of the above matters into account  our consolidated operating earnings from continuing operations for were million  which was higher than our operating earnings were benefited by the one time impact of million for a curtailment gain of certain of our postretirement benefit plans 
interest expense for was relatively flat at million compared to during we made payments on our debt of million 
however  this decrease in debt was offset by the increase in the euro against the us dollar  causing increased expense associated with our euro denominated senior subordinated notes due and increase in market rates 
the weighted average interest rate paid on all outstanding debt at december  was  as compared to at december  during  we recorded a loss of million related to the prepayment of our term loan b facility 
this loss related to the write off of unamortized financing fees and unwinding of our floating to fixed interest rate swap 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was  compared to in the effective tax rate benefited from certain global tax planning initiatives and fixed permanent book tax differences 
discontinued operations in include the results of operations of dri  toledo ship repair both discontinued in north central crane and our awp business 
in addition  it includes the gain on the sale of our subsidiary delta manlift 
the discontinued awp business included our delta subsidiary  which was sold in the second quarter of  the liftlux product line and facility located in dillingen  germany  our scissor lift and boom lift product categories  and our us manlift product line 
sales and operating earnings by segment operating earnings reported below by segment include the impact of reductions due to restructurings and plant consolidation costs  whereas these expenses were separately identified in the results of consolidated operations table above 
cranes and related products net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to net sales from the crane segment for the year ended december  increased to billion versus billion for the year ended december  the increase occurred in all major geographic regions as well as in our aftermarket sales and service business 
from a product line standpoint this sales increase was driven by increased volumes of tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  increased sales in our aftermarket sales and service business  increased crawler crane sales in europe and asia  and increased boom truck sales in north america 
the stronger average euro currency over the us dollar in compared to had a less than one percent favorable impact on sales 
as of december   total crane segment backlog was million  a increase over the december  backlog which was million 
for the year ended december   the crane segment reported operating earnings of million compared to million for the year ended december  crane segment operating earnings for the year ended december  was affected by a charge of million related to restructuring activities 
that restructuring charge related to costs incurred during the second and third quarter of for the consolidation of certain of our european crane facilities 
this charge has been included in restructuring and plant consolidation costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  operating earnings of the crane segment for the year ended december  were positively affected by increased volume across all regions and products  productivity gains as a result of consolidation efforts during the past several years  and effective leveraging of engineering  selling and administrative expenses on higher sales volumes 
for the year ended december   operating earnings were not significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchanges rates 
year ended december  compared to net sales from the crane segment increased to billion for versus million for the increased sales in was driven by increased volume of tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  increased crawler crane sales in asia  increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  and the impact of the euro exchange rate from year to year 
the impact of the euro exchange rate was of the increase in sales during  as compared to as of december   total crane segment backlog was million compared to million as of december  for  the crane segment reported net operating earnings of million compared to million for the crane segment recorded restructuring charges during and of million and million  respectively  which are included in operating earnings of the crane segment for each respective year 
operating earnings of the crane segment during were positively impacted by increased volume  the euro exchange rate and cost savings as a result of prior year integration actions 
operating earnings were negatively impacted by competitive pricing into emerging markets  and increased commodity prices 
increased commodity prices  primarily steel  negatively impacted crane segment operating earnings by million  net of pricing actions in versus foodservice equipment segment prior year sales and operating earnings of the foodservice segment have been restated for the discontinued operation of dri 
net sales operating earnings operating margin year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase was driven by higher sales in the ice and beverage divisions offset by slightly lower sales in the refrigeration division 
the increase occurred in both unit volume and higher prices 
the increase in pricing was in response to higher commodity costs experienced during the higher volumes in the ice and beverage divisions were driven by hotter than normal temperatures throughout much of the united states during the summer of the decrease in sales of the refrigeration division reflects a slowing in the rate of new restaurant construction in the united states and the timing of larger equipment replacement projects 
foodservice segment operating earnings of million for were down million from operating earnings of million in the decrease in operating earnings in is the result of a restructuring charge of million taken relating to the consolidation of the kolpak facility located in river falls  wisconsin with the kolpak facility located in parsons  tennessee 
on a comparative basis  restructuring costs included in operating earnings of the foodservice segment for the year ended december  were million 
the restructuring charge relates to the closure of the european ice machine manufacturing business 
offsetting the restructuring charge were increases in operating earnings of both the ice and beverage divisions 
operating earnings for the year ended were positively impacted by increased sales volume 
the increased pricing discussed above was entirely offset by increases in commodity costs and did not have a favorable impact on operating earnings for the year ended december  operating earnings for the year ended december  were also negatively affected by the costs of the ongoing investment in a segment wide erp project within the foodservice segment and the creation of the domestic foodservice shared service function 
year ended december  compared to foodservice segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of higher sales in our ice machine business 
the ice machine business performed well all year  outpacing the industry and posting the highest market share in our history 
sluggish demand in end markets  held net sales flat or down slightly in our beverage and refrigeration businesses for versus during  the foodservice segment introduced new products  which helped drive the aggregate segment sales increase 
operating earnings of million for increased approximately compared to operating earnings of million for operating margins were up to for compared to for operating earnings were positively impacted by increased sales in our ice machine business 
this increase  however  was somewhat offset by increased prices for steel and other commodities 
in addition  the foodservice segment incurred expenses of approximately million during related to the ongoing implementation of a segment wide erp system 
the company did not incur similar costs in the foodservice segment incurred approximately million and million of restructuring costs  which are included in operating earnings in and  respectively 
marine segment prior year sales and operating earnings of the marine segment have been restated for the discontinued operation of toledo ship repair 
net sales operating earnings loss operating margin year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales was primarily driven by several new construction vessels  as well as revenue from a navy prototype vessel 
during we completed the third staten island ferry for the city of new york  the initial production of the navy s inls lighterage system  a great lakes ice breaker  and four double hull tank barges 
also contributing to the increase in revenue in was the winter repair season revenue  which increased by approximately million compared to for  the marine segment reported a loss from operations of approximately million 
this loss is primarily the result of a million reserve recorded during the fourth quarter of we have been in negotiations with one of our marine customers to recover certain cost overruns that resulted from change orders related to a particular contract 
during the third quarter of  due to the fact that these negotiations were not successful within a timeframe satisfactory to us  we filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of these cost overruns from the customer 
the customer subsequently filed a counter suit against us in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we established a reserve of million to reflect the inherent uncertainties in litigation of this type 
the million reserve is recorded in cost of sales of the marine segment in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  although we have established this reserve  we believe we are contractually entitled to these cost recoveries and we intend to continue to seek recovery of all amounts owed 
if we are successful in our recovery of costs as a result of this lawsuit or negotiations  the favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows in a future period could be material 
in addition to the million reserve  operating results were negatively affected by cost increases in material and production inefficiencies experienced on certain specific construction contracts 
labor inefficiencies were incurred due to delays and disruption caused by customer change orders and a larger mix of first time or limited vessel construction projects 
in addition  the large number of projects in process at the same time in our shipyards  a shortage of available specific skilled labor  and project rework requirements all resulted in greater than normal utilization of costlier subcontract labor on certain contracts 
finally  the majority of the marine segment revenues during the second half of the year were from a relatively low margin first run military prototype vessel that is structured as a cost plus contract 
at december   the marine segment has a growing backlog of projects that match the capabilities of our two shipyards and a build schedule that allows for a more efficient use of our resources 
in addition  all current contracts have terms that help shield manitowoc from future commodity price escalation 
year ended december  compared to marine segment net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of higher commercial contract revenue from construction contracts awarded to us during late and early in addition  sales for were adversely affected by the day strike at marinette marine corporation marinette 
also  we had greater repair work in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of repair work is normally at higher margins than new construction work 
between january and april of  we had one of the largest fleets in our history docked at our sturgeon bay shipyard 
during we completed our multi year contract for a fleet of seagoing buoy tenders for the us coast guard  and we delivered two staten island ferries for the city of new york  along with two double hull tank barges  and an ocean going tug for a commercial customer 
marine segment operating earnings of million in was a increase over operating earnings of million for the increase in operating earnings in versus was primarily a result of the amount of commercial contracts being worked on in versus  as well as the winter repair season at our sturgeon bay facility and the impact of the strike in general corporate expenses net sales corporate expenses of net sales year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased million to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily the result of the following i costs incurred in setting up the accounts receivable securitization facility  ii costs incurred in the pursuit of potential acquisition targets  iii increased employee related costs  and iv higher depreciation costs on technical infrastructure investments 
year ended december  compared to corporate expenses increased in versus the increase in corporate expenses in compared to is primarily the result of million in expense for a sales and use tax settlement incurred in the first quarter of and costs associated with our compliance activities relating to the sarbanes oxley act of market conditions and outlook during  we will strive to protect our market shares  improve our cost structures  and continue to invest in new product development 
because of our global crane businesses and our continued focus to become more global in our foodservice businesses  we are affected now more than ever by non domestic world economies 
the economies of europe and asia  in particular  affect our performance 
we believe that our diversified business model  global presence  and broad product offerings proved beneficial to us in and will continue to provide stability to our company into the future 
product line and geographic diversification within our segments also proved beneficial 
cranes and related products the global crane market continued its recovery in this increase benefited most of our regional and product end markets 
this included the beginning of the upturn in the domestic crawler crane business late in material costs continued to escalate throughout  but at a rate lower than in product pricing continued to increase during the year as the industry passed along these costs to the end markets 
the crane segment also offset these price increases with other material and manufacturing cost reductions 
price increases to recover material cost increases and other manufacturing cost reductions have contributed to the improved gross margins in the crane segment 
in  we expect to see some minor escalation of material costs which we anticipate the industry will again offset with pricing actions 
during  we grew market share within most product categories globally 
we have responded to significant increases in demand in asia by undertaking the construction of a new crane manufacturing facility in china 
the improvement in overall market share is partially a reflection of continued significant investment in new products  which included the introduction of new products in we will continue to invest in new products and product support in looking ahead  we expect volumes to increase significantly in north america for all products as a result of the cyclical crane recovery  the impact of market share increases and the overall market conditions 
we believe the construction equipment market has now entered the second year of the growth phase of the cycle  which is typically several years in duration 
further  the domestic crawler market  which tends to lag the overall crane market  appears to be recovering with greater growth expected in we expect asia will continue to grow  driven by the china expansion and general recovery of asian economies 
in addition we expect to see commodity costs rise in  but at a lower level than the last two years 
we have developed strategies to help us adapt to these conditions 
in this environment we plan to protect our market share by providing our customers with what we believe is the best value in the industry 
we will work to grow our market share globally by leveraging the strength of our brand names  product service and support  and expanded product offerings 
in  we plan to introduce new crane models 
we will continue to expand our global reach 
one way to achieve this expansion is through the strategic positioning of our sales and product support infrastructure in asia 
in addition  our global sales force is cross selling our entire product line 
our past acquisitions have given us a broad product offering and worldwide distribution and product support 
we believe these factors along with new product introductions will help us continue to grow market share in we believe that our growth strategy is solid and supported by the diversification of our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
we will continue to attack our markets geographically  rather than by product line 
foodservice equipment in  the foodservice segment introduced more than new products for the fourth consecutive year 
these new product introductions contributed to a market share gain in ice machines and steady sales in our other product categories 
the domestic foodservice industry got off to a strong start in  but weakened in the early spring due to abnormally cool and wet conditions in some areas of the us after a late start to the ultimately hot summer weather  foodservice equipment sales picked up mid year and remained quite strong through the fall and early winter 
the dramatic rise in commodity costs throughout and early  offset by price increases in  presented challenges for us in in most of our businesses we reacted to soft sales trends partially caused by those price increases with calculated pricing actions 
those actions were taken selectively on particular product models or features to gain a competitive edge 
the impact of these price adjustments were off set by volume increases 
we expect that the same factors that drove our strong operating performance in will continue to drive our business in we expect that the market will grow in at approximately the same rate than it did in  and we believe we are positioned to outperform the industry due to our wide range of new products that were introduced in the past years and will be introduced in we also will continue to invest in foreign markets during with the completion of our new manufacturing and engineering center in hangzhou  china  we are poised to expand our sales and marketing presence in the region 
the increased presence will leverage our brand strength in the fastest growing foodservice equipment market in the world 
although we are presently only manufacturing ice machines and beverage equipment in this facility  we plan to expand manufacturing to other foodservice products for this region as well 
marine was a busy year for the marine segment 
the winter repair season was strong  with vessels in the shipyard from january to april 
we completed the final staten island ferry along with the first release of the improved naval lighterage system inls 
three petroleum tank barges were completed at various times throughout the year  with construction of an additional tank barge started 
the marine segment also started the design phase of a tank barge contract awarded late in the year 
at year end  work was near completion on a self unloading cement barge  and construction was in full swing on the prototype littoral combat ship 
we delivered the great lakes icebreaker mackinaw to the coast guard late in the year 
lingering cost issues on three specific projects carried over into from  adversely affecting margins 
we have implemented various measures to mitigate these issues in new and future contracts 
as in the past two years  we expect that will prove to be busy  based on the volume of work in backlog at december  construction efforts will continue on the littoral combat ship  as will work on additional units of inls 
also  we will commence work on the design award phase of the navy s radar ship replacement program for the cobra judy 
we believe mid sized shipyards such as manitowoc marine have an opportunity to play an increasing larger role in the future military and government vessel procurements 
commercial work for includes the completion of a self unloading cement barge  one double hull tank barge  and one articulated tug and barge at b unit 
in addition  work will commence on another double hull tank barge and a second at b unit  with deliveries schedule for late in significant market activity in recent months has provided the marine segment with good opportunities to build a solid backlog 
finally  we expect that the great lakes winter repair season will at least equal that of lake activity is governed primarily by two factors i the health of the coal and iron ore freight market  and ii the cycle of the required regulatory inspections 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during was million compared to million in we applied a portion of this cash flow to capital spending  dividends and payment of outstanding debt 
in addition  we had million in cash and short term investments on hand at december   an increase of million versus in addition we had million of unused availability under our secured revolving credit facility at december  the availability under the secured revolving credit facility is reduced for an outstanding balance of million and outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  on january   we completed the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes due  which required us to pay a premium to the note holders of million 
during  accounts receivable and inventory increased by million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily the result of higher sales and backlog in the crane segment 
offsetting these increases in operating assets was a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  primarily associated with the increased inventory 
during the fourth quarter of we entered into a million accounts receivable securitization facility  which resulted in a increase in cash flow from operations from the sale of certain domestic crane segment receivables at the end of the year 
we spent a total of million during for capital expenditures 
we continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our business  to invest in new processes  products and technology  and to maintain high quality production standards 
the following table summarizes capital expenditures and depreciation by segment 
capital expenditures depreciation crane foodservice marine corporate total the significant capital expenditures in include the continued investment in the foodservice segment s erp system  the new china manufacturing facilities in the crane and foodservice segments  production machinery and equipment  and new product tooling 
during and  we sold two businesses 
during we sold our dri business and received proceeds of approximately million  and in we sold delta and received approximately million in proceeds 
this cash is reported in the discontinued operations section of the cash flow from investing activities 
in december  we sold  pursuant to an underwritten public offering  approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net cash proceeds from this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  were million 
in addition to underwriting discounts and commissions  we incurred approximately million of additional accounting  legal and other expenses related to the offering that were charged to additional paid in capital 
we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due and to pay the required premium to the note holders of million 
we used the balance for general corporate purposes 
the redemption of the senior subordinated notes due was completed on january  during the years ended december  and  we sold million and million  respectively  of our long term notes receivable to third party financing companies 
we guaranty varying percentages  up to  of collection of the notes to the financing companies 
we have accounted for the sales of the notes as a financing of receivables 
the receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheet  net of payments made  in other current and non current assets  and we have recognized an obligation equal to the net outstanding balance of the notes in other current and non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the cash flow benefit of these transactions  net of payments made by the customer  is reflected as financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
during the years ended december  and the customers paid million and million  respectively  of the notes to the third party financing companies 
as of december  and  the outstanding balance of the notes receivables guaranteed by us was million and million  respectively 
our debt at december   consisted primarily of borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility  our senior unsecured notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  and our senior subordinated notes due  as well as outstanding amounts under foreign overdraft facilities and capital leases 
in june  we entered into a five year  million  secured revolving credit facility  which replaced our million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in may the credit facility also provides for our ability to access an additional million of borrowing capacity during the life of the facility under the same terms 
borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin  which is based on the company s consolidated total leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
the annual commitment fee in effect at december  on the unused portion of the secured revolving credit facility was 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at an effective interest rate of and million of outstanding letters of credit 
on november   we completed the sale of million of senior notes due senior notes due 
the senior notes due are unsecured senior obligations ranking prior to our million euro of senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due and prior to our million of senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due 
our secured revolving credit facility ranks equally with the senior notes due  except that it is secured by substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
interest on the senior notes due is payable semiannually in may and november each year 
the senior notes due can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after november  in addition  we may redeem for a premium at any time prior to november   up to of the face amount of the senior notes due with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings 
we had outstanding at december   million euro million based on december  exchange rates of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations ranking subordinate in right of payment to all of our senior debt other than our senior subordinated notes due  are equal in rank to our senior subordinated notes due  and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on these senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in may and november of each year 
these notes can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium after may  we also had outstanding at december   million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes due are unsecured obligations of the company ranking subordinate in right of payment to all of our senior debt other than our senior subordinated notes due  are equal in rank to our senior subordinated notes due  and are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on the senior subordinated notes due is payable semiannually in february and august each year 
these notes can be redeemed by us in whole or in part for a premium on or after august  our secured revolving credit facility  senior notes due  and senior subordinated notes due and contain customary affirmative and negative covenants 
in general  the covenants contained in the secured revolving credit facility are more restrictive than those of the senior notes due and the senior subordinated notes due and among other restrictions  these covenants require us to meet specified financial tests  such as a consolidated interest coverage ratio  consolidated total leverage ratio  and consolidated senior leverage ratio 
these covenants also limit  among other things  our ability to redeem or repurchase our debt  incur additional debt  make acquisitions  merge with other entities  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase capital stock  and create or become subject to liens 
the secured revolving credit facility also contains cross default provisions whereby certain defaults under any other debt agreements would result in default under the secured revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december   and based upon our current plans and outlook  we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent month period 
our debt position increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions and results in a significant portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the secured revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the secured revolving credit facility or other future facilities may be used for funding future acquisitions  seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other investing and financing needs 
we believe that our available cash  secured revolving credit facility  cash generated from future operations  and access to public debt and equity markets will be adequate to fund our capital and debt financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our secured revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the secured revolving credit facility million as of december  
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due and and our senior notes due b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our historical activities at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that the risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to materially affect our credit ratings or would otherwise adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing 
d 
we do not have any significant guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties 
we have disclosed information related to guarantees in note to our consolidated financial statements 
e 
written options on non financial assets for example  real estate puts 
we do not have any written options on non financial assets 
off balance sheet arrangements our disclosures concerning transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources are as follows we have disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements our buyback and residual value guaranty commitments 
we also lease various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are also disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have disclosed our accounts receivable factoring arrangement and our accounts receivable securitization arrangement in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows total committed thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total committed there were no significant purchase obligation commitments at december  table above does not include interest payments additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million 
we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees outstanding  that if all were satisfied in full at december   the total cash cost to us would be million  this amount is not reduced for amounts the company would recover from repossessing and subsequent resale of collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the pension plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  cash contributions to the pension plans by us were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in we used interest rate swaps entered into with third party financial institutions such that approximately of our debt is fixed and is floating at december  at december   we had five fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding 
these swap contracts effectively convert million of our fixed rate senior subordinated and senior notes to variable rate debt 
under these swap agreements  we contract with a counter party to exchange the difference between a floating rate and the fixed rate applied to million of our senior subordinated notes and senior notes 
these contracts are considered to be a hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate obligations 
accordingly  these interest rate swap contracts are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at december  as a net liability of million  and the related debt is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the interest rate swap contract  as well as the offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the change in the fair value of the swaps exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings from these swaps for the year ended december  a increase or decrease in the floating rate we pay under these swap agreements would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
this amount was calculated assuming the year end weighted average rate of the swaps was constant throughout the year 
interest swaps expose us to the risk that the counter party may be unable to pay amounts it owes us under the swap agreements 
to manage this risk we enter into swap agreements only with financial institutions that have high credit ratings 
commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  foam  and aluminum 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized across business segments  and others are specific to a business segment or business unit 
in and  certain of these commodities were subject to abnormal availability and significant price increases 
although we have established procedures in place to manage these pressures  we can provide no assurance that these measures will insulate us fully from adverse consequences of continued unfavorable developments in the commodity markets 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominantly between our euro denominated operations and their customers outside the euro zone 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement date of the related transactions 
we also periodically hedge anticipated transactions  primarily at firm order date for orders to be sold into non euro denominated locations  with forward exchange contracts 
these forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts hedging underlying accounts receivable with a fair market value of million and forward exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders with a fair market value of million 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december   would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables 
any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging outstanding firm orders would not have a significant impact due to the relatively immaterial amount of contracts outstanding being hedged 
our primary translation exchange risk exposure at december  was with the euro 
to a much lesser extent  we are also exposed to translation risk with our other foreign operations  primarily in the united kingdom 
our euro denominated million senior subordinated notes due offsets a significant amount of the translation risk with our operations in europe 
the currency effects of this foreign denominated debt obligation are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss account within stockholders equity  where it offsets the translation impact of an equal amount of similarly foreign denominated net assets of our european operations 
a appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at december  would have an impact of increasing or decreasing the outstanding debt balance on our consolidated balance sheet by million 
this impact would be partially offset by gains and losses on our net investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro 
at december   there was also a portion of our foreign currency translation exposure that was not hedged 
amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollar at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december   is million 
using year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in foreign operations at december  was approximately million of which million was naturally hedged with local  non us dollar debt 
environmental  health  safety  and other matters we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cerla in connection with the lemberger landfill superfund site near manitowoc  wisconsin 
approximately potentially responsible parties have been identified as having shipped hazardous materials to this site 
eleven of those  including us  have formed the lemberger site remediation group and have successfully negotiated with the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources to fund the cleanup and settle their potential liability at this site 
estimates indicate that the total costs to clean up this site are approximately million 
although liability is joint and several  our share of the liability is estimated to be of the total cost 
prior to december   we accrued million in connection with this matter 
remediation work at the site has been substantially completed  with only long term pumping and treating of groundwater and site maintenance remaining 
our remaining estimated liability for this matter  included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
based on the size of our current allocation of liabilities at this site  the existence of other viable potential responsible parties and current reserve  we do not believe that any liability imposed in connection with this site will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
during the due diligence process for the sale of dri certain contaminants in the soil and ground water associated with the facility were identified 
as part of the sale agreement  we agreed to be responsible for costs associated with further investigation and remediation of the issues identified 
estimates indicate that the costs to remediate this site are approximately million 
during december  we recorded a million reserve for these estimated costs 
this charge is recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  based upon available information  we do not expect the ultimate costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
at certain of our other facilities  we have identified potential contaminants in soil and groundwater 
the ultimate cost of any remediation required will depend upon the results of future investigation 
based upon available information  we do not expect the ultimate costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that we have obtained and are in substantial compliance with those material environmental permits and approvals necessary to conduct our various businesses 
based on the facts presently known  we do not expect environmental compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   various product related lawsuits were pending 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  all of these are insured with self insurance retention levels 
our self insurance retention levels vary by business  and have fluctuated over the last five years 
the range of our self insured retention levels are million to million per occurrence 
the high end of our self insurance retention level is a legacy product liability insurance program inherited in the grove acquisition in for cranes manufactured in the united states for occurrences from january through october as of december   the largest self insured retention level currently maintained by us is million per occurrence and applies to product liability claims for cranes manufactured in the united states 
product liability reserves in the consolidated balance sheet at december   were million  million reserved specifically for cases and million for claims incurred but not reported which were estimated using actuarial methods 
based on our experience in defending product liability claims  we believe the current reserves are adequate for estimated case resolutions on aggregate self insured claims and insured claims 
any recoveries from insurance carriers are dependent upon the legal sufficiency of claims and solvency of insurance carriers 
at december  and  we had reserved million and million  respectively  for warranty claims included in product warranties and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
certain of these warranty and other related claims involve matters in dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiations  arbitration  or litigation 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates for environmental remediation  product liability and warranty costs may change in the near future based upon new information that may arise or matters that are beyond the scope of our historical experience 
presently  there are no reliable methods to estimate the amount of any such potential changes 
we are involved in numerous lawsuits involving asbestos related claims in which we are one of numerous defendants 
after taking into consideration legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  the current political environment with respect to asbestos related claims  and the liabilities accrued with respect to such matters  in the opinion of management  ultimate resolution is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is also involved in various legal actions arising out of the normal course of business  which  taking into account the liabilities accrued and legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have been in negotiations with one of our marine customers to recover certain cost overruns that resulted from change orders related to a particular contract 
during the third quarter of  due to the fact that these negotiations were not successful within a timeframe satisfactory to us  we filed a lawsuit seeking recovery of these cost overruns from the customer 
the customer subsequently filed a counter suit against us in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we established a reserve of million to reflect the inherent uncertainties in litigation of this type 
the million reserve is recorded in cost of sales of the marine segment in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  although we have established this reserve  we believe we are contractually entitled to these cost recoveries and we intend to continue to seek recovery of all amounts owed 
if we are successful in our recovery of costs as a result of this lawsuit or negotiations  the favorable impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows in a future period could be material 
during the first quarter of  we reached a settlement agreement with a third party and recorded a million gain  net of legal and settlement costs  in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we are contingently liable under open standby letters of credit issued by our banks in favor of third parties totaling million 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
although we have listed a number of accounting policies below which we believe to be most critical  we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important to the reader 
therefore  please refer also to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied with regard to a specific transaction persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  collectibility of cash is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we periodically enter into transactions with customers that provide for residual value guarantees and buyback commitments 
these transactions are recorded as operating leases for all significant residual value guarantees and for all buyback commitments 
these initial transactions are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized to income on a straight line basis over a period equal to that of the customer s third party financing agreement 
in addition  we lease cranes to customers under operating lease terms 
proceeds received in connection with these transactions are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease  and leased cranes are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting revenue under long term contracts within the marine segment are recognized using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under this method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract 
recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded as recoverable costs and accrued profit on progress completed not billed  which are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
likewise  contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded as amounts billed in excess of sales  which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed when customer change orders are placed and on a regular periodic basis 
sales and gross profit are adjusted when known for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
estimated losses are recorded when identified 
the use of the poc method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods 
the company continually evaluates all of the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the poc method of accounting 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts based on pre established percentages to specific aging categories which are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using both the first in  first out fifo method and the last in  first out lifo method and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories together with a general provision based on pre established percentages applied to specific aging categories of inventory 
these categories are evaluated based upon historical usage  estimated future usage  and sales requiring the inventory 
these percentages were established based upon historical write off experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  however  it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units  which have been determined to be cranes americas  cranes europe  middle east  and africa  cranes asia  ice group  refrigeration group  beverage group  and marine group  using a fair value method based on the present value of future cash flows  which involves management s judgments and assumptions 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at june   indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
indefinite and definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality rates  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach we use to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate our discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of our pension plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase our compensation increase assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates our retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates our health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
product liability we are subject in the normal course of business to product liability lawsuits 
to the extent permitted under applicable laws  our exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self insurance retention limits 
we record product liability reserves for our self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
our reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  we track the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each based upon our best judgment and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case 
second  we obtain a third party actuarial analysis to determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred but not reported product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserve collectively referred to as ibnr 
this actuarial analysis is performed at least twice annually and our ibnr reserve for product liability is adjusted based upon the results of these analysis 
we have established a position within the actuarially determined range  which we believe is the best estimate of the ibnr liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance that represents a reserve on deferred tax assets for which utilization is uncertain 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted in the event future taxable income is materially different than amounts estimated 
our policy is to remit earnings from foreign subsidiaries only to the extent any resultant foreign taxes are creditable in the united states 
accordingly  we do not currently provide for additional united states and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
stock options we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock option based employee compensation costs are reflected in earnings  as all option grants under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
warranties in the normal course of business we provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship  and in some cases materials  on products manufactured by us 
such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from months to months 
if a product fails to comply with our warranty  we may be obligated  at our expense to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our warranty at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products 
these costs primarily include labor and materials  as necessary associated with repair or replacement 
the primary factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities are recognized when the liability is incurred 
we use the definition of liability found in fasb concept statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
in addition  the liability for the restructuring charge associated with an exit or disposal activity is measured initially at its fair value 
recent accounting changes and pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged

this interpretation further clarified conditional asset retirement obligations  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective applications to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
in addition  this statement requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
this new accounting standard is effective january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
