non gaap financial measures from time to time we may measure certain financial information on a constant currency basis 
such constant currency financial data is not a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure 
constant currency removes from financial data the impact of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries  by translating the current period financial data into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the financial data for the previous period 
we believe presenting certain results on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of the performance of our foreign operations from period to period 
additionally  certain internal reporting and compensation targets are based on constant currency financial data for our various foreign subsidiaries 
however  constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures that reflect current period exchange rates  or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
from to  we acquired eleven businesses for our north american professional services segment four legal staffing businesses acquired in february of  august of  august of  and october of 
table of contents  three health care staffing businesses acquired in february of  march of  and september of  and four accounting and finance staffing businesses acquired in february of  july of  october of  and september of in addition  we acquired two it solutions businesses  in july and september of  in our north american it services segment 
the accounting and finance staffing business and the it solutions business acquired in september of were part of the same acquisition 
from time to time we may measure certain financial information excluding the effect of acquisitions 
such financial data that excludes the effect of businesses we acquire is not a gaap financial measure 
we believe presenting some results excluding the effects of businesses we acquire is helpful to investors because it permits a comparison of the performance of our core internal operations from period to period 
additionally  certain internal reporting and compensation targets are based on the performance of core internal operations 
the effect of a business we acquire is generally excluded for only the first months following the acquisition date 
subsequent to this  a business is considered to be integrated for reporting purposes 
again however  such measures should be considered only in conjunction with the correlative measures that include the results from acquisitions  as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
additionally  from time to time we may use ebitda to measure results of operations 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is a meaningful measure of operating performance as it gives management a consistent measurement tool for evaluating the operating activities of the business as a whole  as well as  the various operating units  before the effect of investing activities  interest and taxes 
in addition  we believe ebitda provides useful information to investors  analysts  lenders  and other interested parties because it excludes transactions that management considers unrelated to core business operations  thereby helping interested parties to more meaningfully evaluate  trend and analyze the operating performance of our business 
we also use ebitda for certain internal reporting purposes  and certain compensation targets may be based on ebitda 
finally  certain covenants in our debt facility are based on ebitda performance measures 
ebitda  as with all non gaap financial measures  should be considered only in conjunction with the comparable measures  as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  including net income 
discontinued operations in december  we sold certain operating assets and transferred certain operating liabilities of our outplacement unit 
as a result of the sale of this unit and in accordance with gaap  the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations report the results of operations of our outplacement unit as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in  this unit generated million in revenue and had a million loss before income taxes 
we recorded contract termination costs of  in as a result of the sale 
additional information can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
associated with this  we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies in that they are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize substantially all revenue at the time services are provided  and on a time and materials basis 
in most cases  the consultant is our employee and all costs of employing the worker are our responsibility and are included in cost of revenue 
revenues generated when we permanently place an individual with a client are recorded at the time of start 
in addition and to a lesser extent  we are involved in fixed price or lump sum engagements 
the services we render under the relevant contracts generally require performance spanning more than one accounting period 
we recognize revenue for these engagements under the proportional performance accounting model 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly monitor and assess our risk of not collecting amounts we are owed by our customers 
this evaluation is based upon a variety of factors including an analysis of amounts current and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
based upon the results of this analysis  we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment includes anticipating future income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management evaluates all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the establishment and amount of a valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based  for example  on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  completion of federal  state or foreign audits  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction  and as a result of acquisitions 
we have future tax deductions associated with tax deductible goodwill 
our tax basis in tax deductible goodwill will be deducted in our income tax returns  generating million of future tax deductions over the next years 
in addition  we have a net deferred tax asset as of december  and the components of our net deferred tax assets as well as other information on income taxes can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
stock option plans we have historically issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
us gaap allowed alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
we have chosen to account for our stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and  as a result  no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the consolidated financial statements 
restricted stock grants are accounted for in accordance with apb  which mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions be calculated using the intrinsic value 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  calculations of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share  computed in accordance with the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  are set forth in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r beginning with the first quarter of sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
upon adoption of sfas r  we will be required to recognize compensation on all share based grants made on or after january   and for the unvested portion of share based grants made prior to january  
table of contents impairment of tangible and intangible assets for acquisitions  we allocate the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets  if any  and then to goodwill 
in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform goodwill impairment reviews  at least annually  utilizing a fair value approach 
we performed valuation testing during the fourth quarters of  and our designated timing of the annual impairment test under sfas no 
and did not incur any impairment 
we plan to perform our next annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of an impairment review prior to our next scheduled annual review may be required if certain events occur  including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units 
in addition  changes to other assumptions could significantly impact our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
such a change may result in a goodwill impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on the reportable segments that include the related reporting units and the consolidated financial statements 
we used an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables to arrive at fair value for sfas no 
for the discounted cash flow analysis  significant assumptions included expected future revenue growth rates  reporting unit profit margins  working capital levels and a discount rate 
the revenue growth rates and reporting unit profit margins are based  in part  on its expectation of an improving economic environment 
market comparables included a comparison of the market ratios and performance fundamentals from comparable companies 
the use of these measurement criteria is consistent with the underlying concepts used in determining the fair value of a company or reportable unit under the market approach 
the market ratios we used refer to the multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable companies and the performance fundamentals refer to the consideration of the effects of the differences in the operating metrics  ie 
growth rates  operating margins  gross margins  etc 
on our value versus the comparable companies 
additional information on goodwill can be found in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize the cost of identifiable intangible assets either through acquisition or as part of intellectual property over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite 
we review our long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles would be based on the fair value of the asset 
executive summary we believe that economic conditions strengthened during and  both in the united states and abroad  which had a favorable impact on both mps and our industry 
for and  we were able to grow revenue in all of our segments 
in addition to the improved macroeconomic conditions  we believe this revenue growth is attributable to recent investments we have made in our business including investments in additional sales and recruiting staff  acquisitions  new service offerings  and new office openings 
specifically in and  we acquired nine businesses for our north american professional services segment together  the professional acquisitions two legal staffing businesses acquired in august and october of  three health care staffing businesses acquired in february of  march of  and september of  and four accounting and finance staffing businesses acquired in february of  july of  october of  and september of in addition  we acquired two it services solutions businesses for our north american it segment together  the it acquisitions  in july and september of while we continue to believe we will experience future revenue growth  we expect our revenue to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in our consolidated revenue increased and our operating income increased from direct hire fees increased from  and now represent of revenue  up from in in addition  we 
table of contents continued to diversify  with revenue from our professional services division now representing of consolidated revenue in compared to in for  we will continue to look for opportunities to increase gross margin along with increasing operating leverage within each segment 
specifically  within the european it services segment  our lowest gross margin segment  we are realizing the positive margin impact from scaling back relationships with certain low margin  high volume clients in order to focus on higher margin clients 
in addition  we have a foundation for growth with million of cash on hand at year end  a million credit facility with no outstanding borrowings  no long term debt  and working capital of million

thus  the company will not restate the results of prior periods 
the company expects the effects of applying the modified prospective transition method to outstanding and unvested awards as of the effective date to be immaterial 
however  the company is still evaluating the potential impact of subsequent awards 
subsequent awards may have a material impact on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on the company s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of our market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations under the credit facility and to our investments 
we have an investment portfolio consisting of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities of days or less 
we are adverse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
we evaluate our invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated approximately of consolidated revenue  approximately of which was from the united kingdom 
as of december   we have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u 
s dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a 
table of contents reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are exposed to minimal price fluctuations on equity mutual funds that are contained within our company owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of the company owned life insurance was million at december   and is included in other assets  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
changes to the cash surrender value are recognized in other income  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
this company owned life insurance is intended to be used to settle our obligations of deferred compensation 
therefore  a corresponding employee liability is included in other in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets
