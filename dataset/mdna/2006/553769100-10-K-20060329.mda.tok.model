mountaineer park s operating results during the year ended december   net revenues decreased by million  or  primarily due to a million decline in gaming revenues 
parimutuel commissions decreased by million  food  beverage and lodging revenues remained consistent and revenue from other sources decreased by million 
promotional allowances decreased by million 
mountaineer park s operating margin decreased to in from in  a decrease of 
operating margins at mountaineer park were impacted due to an increase in costs associated with our self insured employee health care plan of approximately million during  reduced salaries and benefit costs of million during related to corporate functions that were transferred from mountaineer park to corporate  offset by the net effect of changes in other expense components  such as advertising and repairs and maintenance costs  an increase in depreciation expenses of million related to increases in capital purchases and the acceleration of depreciation expense during resulting from the reduction of the useful lives of certain coin drop machines  and a decrease in the gross profit from gaming operations as discussed below 
we entered into an insured health care plan effective january  a discussion of mountaineer park s key operations is as follows 
gaming operations 
revenues from gaming operations decreased by million  or  to million during compared to gross profit from gaming operations decreased by million  or  during compared to management attributes the decline in revenue from gaming operations during to the following factors competition from limited video lottery terminals in local bars and clubs  increased fuel costs and general economic conditions  and one fewer day in compared to for example  the west virginia lottery commission reported that for its fiscal year ended june   video lottery terminals in bars and clubs lvls in hancock and brooke counties mountaineer park s market area experienced net revenue growth of to million with actual video lottery terminals at these bars and clubs increasing by to machines 
management expects the competition from limited video lottery terminals to continue to impact revenues into the second quarter of  but management expects the rate of growth of the lvls to decline 
management has recently implemented targeted marketing campaigns using direct mailers designed to increase trip frequency and gaming value for patrons 
in addition  new game themes and enhanced slot products have been introduced to enhance market position 
additionally  management believes that the implementation of multi state  wide area progressive jackpots at mountaineer  which the lottery commission intends to implement in may of  will improve gaming revenue 
the multi state progressive program is expected to provide jackpots in excess of million and will therefore further differentiate mountaineer s slot offering from the lvls  which  as a practical matter  will not be able to participate 
during the year ended december   mountaineer park s average daily net win per machine decreased by to compared to during a summary of video lottery gross wagers  less winning patron payouts at mountaineer park for the years ended december were as follows 
in thousands total gross wagers less winning patron payouts gaming revenues management believes that if west virginia were to enact proposed legislation for table games at the state s racetracks  which did not pass during the regular or special sessions  mountaineer may increase its market penetration  which could contribute to mountaineer park s growth in gaming revenues and further development as a destination resort 
however  in any event  the commencement of gaming operations at racetracks and free standing slot parlors in pennsylvania may have a negative impact on mountaineer park s growth  depending on the location of the gaming facilities 
on november   the pennsylvania harness racing commission denied licenses to two applicants who had proposed racetracks with slot machines in locations approximately miles from mountaineer park 
the net effect of the implementation of table games at mountaineer park  if legislation were enacted  and new competition upon commencement of slot operations in pennsylvania is not known 
effective in july  west virginia legislation increased the portion of the racetracks net win that is contributed into the employee pension fund from to 
this increase is applied to the racetracks net win until the racetrack reaches its excess net terminal income threshold 
for mountaineer park  the threshold is fixed at approximately million 
during  this change increased mountaineer park s cost of gaming by approximately million 
additionally  during  statutory taxes and assessments included in cost of gaming were reduced by million to reflect an adjustment by the west virginia lottery commission to prior period prizes paid  the majority of which we recorded in prior periods without the benefit of the reduction in statutory taxes and assessments 
parimutuel commissions 
parimutuel commissions is a predetermined percentage of the total amount wagered wagering handle  with a higher commission earned on a more exotic wager  such as a trifecta  than on a single horse wager  such as a win  place or show 
in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the total wagering handle is composed of the amounts wagered by each individual according to the wagering activity 
the total amounts wagered form a pool of funds  from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts a take out or gross commission from the amounts wagered  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
our parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total wagering handle or total amounts wagered 
parimutuel commissions for mountaineer park  detailing gross handles less patron payouts and deductions  for years ended december were as follows in thousands import simulcast racing parimutuel handle live racing parimutuel handle less patrons winning tickets revenues export simulcast less state and county parimutuel tax purses and horsemen s association revenues parimutuel commissions the decrease in live and import simulcast racing handle is attributable to decreased attendance resulting from the ability of patrons to place parimutuel wagers via telephone and the internet where permitted by law  and to three fewer live racing days in compared to the decrease in export simulcast revenue was also primarily due to the decrease in live racing days during effective in july  west virginia legislation established a requirement that the racetracks reallocate of the previous of the net win from gaming operations that is contributed into the horsemen s purse fund into a workers compensation debt reduction fund until the aggregate allocations of all racetracks reach million annually 
in the event a racetrack reaches its excess net terminal income before the million is reached annually  the reallocation becomes of the then applicable contributed into the horsemen s purse fund 
in addition  this legislation requires that racetracks reallocate of the net win contributed into the horsemen s purse fund into thoroughbred and greyhound breeding development funds until the racetrack reaches its excess net terminal income threshold 
as a result of these reallocations  mountaineer park reduced regular purses by approximately effective july  unlike the increase in the amount of net win from slot operations that must be contributed into the employee pension fund  this change in the law does not represent an increase in the effective tax rate  but rather a reallocation of the amounts that were already required to be paid 
in november and february purse amounts were increased by 
nevertheless  a reduction in purses for live racing could have an impact on mountaineer park s ability to attract high quality racehorses and the wagering public s interest in live racing 
live racing and import simulcast are expected to continue to be impacted by the conversion of some live racing patrons to export simulcast patrons whether through traditional off track wagering facilities or growth in the utilization of telephone and or internet wagering 
food  beverage and lodging operations 
revenues from food  beverage and lodging operations remained consistent at million during the year ended december   as compared to the average daily room rate for the grande hotel increased to during from during  but the average occupancy rate decreased to from during and  respectively

during  binion s incurred an operating loss of million  which included general and administrative expenses of million  of which million was incurred for land lease payments  and incremental depreciation and amortization of million 
the operating loss for the year corresponds primarily to a shortfall in revenues  in part due to a general decline in downtown las vegas traffic during the third quarter 
we are planning new marketing initiatives and the addition of entertainment and other amenities to increase walk in traffic from fremont street 
las vegas speedway s operating results las vegas speedway s revenue increased by during the year ended december   resulting primarily from gaming operations and lodging

the property s revenues continue to be impacted by declining racing handles

during  scioto downs live racing dates will decrease from to days 
scioto downs has been incorporated into certain mountaineer park simulcasting arrangements 
additionally  we continue to investigate other ways to increase revenues for the property  including telephone and internet wagering  however nothing definitive has been established at this time

these amounts are subject to the substantial risks and difficulties associated with the development of presque isle downs

in connection with the acquisition of the international paper site  we entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the padep regarding a proposed environmental remediation plan for the site 
the proposed plan was based upon a baseline environmental report and it was estimated that such remediation would cost approximately million 
the geidc assumed primary responsibility for the obligations under the consent order relating to the property they acquired 
geidc has agreed to indemnify us from any breach by geidc of its obligation under the consent order 
however  we have been advised by the padep that we have not been released from its liability and responsibility under the consent order 
a revised estimate of the remediation costs cannot be determined at this time since such a determination will be dependent upon the development activities of the geidc 
in connection with the acquisition of binion s  we obtained title to the property and equipment for million exclusive of transaction costs aggregating  free and clear of all debts  subject to increase by million if  at the termination of the joint operating agreement  harrah s achieved certain operational milestones 
we are currently analyzing financial information to determine whether harrah s achieved the specified operational milestones 
the million has been accrued as additional purchase price 
as previously discussed  in june  our wholly owned subsidiary  mtr harness  acquired for an initial investment of  a interest in north metro harness  then a subsidiary of southwest casino and hotel corporation 
on january  the minnesota racing commission granted north metro a license to construct and operate a harness racetrack and card room 
the racetrack would be the second of only two racetracks permitted by current law in the seven county minneapolis metropolitan area 
the purchase agreement called for us to invest an additional million in the project  but we may elect to increase our investment or provide credit enhancements 
during  we made capital contributions of approximately  and in invested an additional million exclusive of legal and other fees in north metro  which includes million invested in october in connection with north metro s acquisition of the real property for the project 
minnesota law permits licensed racetracks to operate a card room with up to tables offering non banked games those in which the players play only against each other instead of against the house  subject to completion of the racetrack s first day live race meet and regulatory approval of a card room plan of operation 
a public interest group has sought judicial review of the issuance of the license 
upon favorable resolution of the legal challenges to the grant of the license  as well as obtaining project financing  north metro intends to commence construction and racing and card room operations at the earliest practicable date 
the project is estimated to cost approximately million for land acquisition and construction and will be separately financed on a non recourse basis to us 
in addition  we are faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation 
these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
management believes that except as set forth above  our cash balances  cash flow from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to cover any capital required to fund maturing debt obligations and any other contemplated capital expenditures and short term funding requirements for the next twelve months  exclusive of the construction of presque isle downs 
the timing of presque isle downs related construction and other expenditures and the timing of other acquisition and development projects will impact our cash flow requirements  such that additional financing will be required 
it is contemplated that such financing may be obtained through an expansion of our existing credit facility  the sale of debt securities or a combination thereof 
management believes that such financing will be available on acceptable terms because of the anticipated cash flow from the proposed development projects 
however  in order to consummate the additional financing we are seeking  we will require the prior consents of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due that are not owned by us or any of our affiliates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such consents 
our inability to obtain such consents would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see the section entitled business risks related to our business for a description of certain circumstances that may affect our sources of liquidity 
we may also repurchase additional shares of our common stock in amounts and at times determined by our board of directors from time to time 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may also finance our expansion  to the extent permitted under existing debt agreements  through the public or private sale of equity securities 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing  if needed  will be available to us  or if available  that the terms of such financing will be on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expansion  development and renovation projects as well as capital expenditures  and selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional debt or equity financing or joint venture partners  or further modifying our bank credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion  development and renovation projects  which may have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also cannot assure you that estimates of our liquidity needs are accurate or that new business developments or other unforeseen events will not occur  resulting in the need to raise additional funds 
our level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may not be able to meet tests and covenants of such debt agreements and achieve satisfactory resolution of such non compliance with the lenders 
in such an event  the holders of our indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
these actions could limit our ability to borrow additional funds and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a debt rating downgrade would not impact the terms of borrowings under our expected fourth amended and restated credit facility or the senior notes 
however  a debt rating downgrade could impact the terms of and our ability to obtain additional new financing 
additionally  changes in the regulatory environment or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming or racing operations  whether arising out of legislation or litigation  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
see section entitled business risks related to our business and note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
regulation and taxes we are subject to extensive regulation by the state of west virginia racing and lottery commissions  nevada gaming authorities  pennsylvania racing commission  pennsylvania gaming authorities  ohio racing commission  minnesota racing commission and the michigan racing commission 
change in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our operations 
taxation 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues  particularly to the states of west virginia and nevada and their counties and municipalities and a future source for pennsylvania 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations 
from time to time  federal  state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming and racing industry 
changes in the tax laws or administration of those laws  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
we believe that recorded tax balances are adequate 
outstanding options on april   the board of directors granted to certain personnel non qualified stock options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of per share  the market price on the date of grant 
the options were granted pursuant to our pre existing plans 
on july   the shareholders ratified the stock incentive plan and reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the exercise of options issued under the plan 
no options have been granted under the plan 
on november   pursuant to an employment agreement and the employee stock incentive plan  we granted to an officer of two wholly owned subsidiaries a non qualified option to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share  the market price on the date of grant 
on february   pursuant to a november  employment agreement and the employee stock incentive plan  we granted to the general manager of one of our properties a non qualified option to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share  the market price on the date of grant 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
if all such options and warrants were exercised  we would receive proceeds of approximately million 
we utilize the treasury stock method in determining the dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants 
our policy is as follows our basic earnings per share eps is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighed average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options  warrants  and other convertible securities utilizing the treasury stock method 
diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of these occurrences 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
gaming revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities  which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons 
gaming and parimutuel revenues are recognized at the time the wagers are made and are net of winning payouts to patrons 
the distributions from these revenues for mountaineer park are governed by the west virginia lottery commission and the west virginia racing commission 
after deduction of a administrative fee paid to the west virginia lottery commission  mountaineer park receives of the first million of video lottery net win per year  based upon west virginia s fiscal year of july june net win in excess of the threshold  which is fixed by statute  is subject to a surcharge 
after reduction for the administrative fee and the surcharge  the net win percentage to be received by us is 
we recognize the reduction in revenue occasioned by the surcharge and the reduction in the percentage of net win allocable to us during the period in which the net win exceeds the predetermined threshold 
accounting for the change in the net win percentage to be retained by us in this manner ensures that revenue is being recognized when all services have been rendered and the amount is fixed or determinable 
the amended lottery act also creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on eligible capital improvements for the racetrack and adjacent property  the track will receive a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the amount of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
we recognize amounts due from the capital reinvestment fund as qualifying capital expenditures are identified 
revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay 
other revenues are recorded at the time the services are rendered or sales are completed 
lodging  food and beverage gratuitously provided to customers are not recognized as revenues 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable annually effective in for goodwill 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows  multiples of earnings or revenues 
during  we performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
self insurance 
effective october  we began self insuring for employee health coverage 
self insurance reserves are estimated based upon our prior claims experience 
changes in the number of employees  claims expense and health care costs could cause this liability to fluctuate 
we also maintained stop loss insurance coverage for employee health care claims 
effective january   we entered into a fully insured health coverage plan for our employees 
we provided for an estimate of the run out of claims under the self insurance plan 
frequent players program 
members of mountaineer s  the speedway s for wagering only and binion s frequent players programs can accumulate points for wagering and other purchases that can be redeemed for lodging  food and beverage and merchandise 
based upon historical redemptions of frequent player program points  we estimate unredeemed points and record a corresponding liability 
changes in the program  increases in membership and changes in the redemption patterns of our participating patrons could cause this liability to fluctuate 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance at december  because we feel that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future operations 
newly issued accounting standards 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in april  the securities and exchange commission extended the effective date of implementation for registrants that are not small business to no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we adopted statement r on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements pro forma stock information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate long term debt arrangements 
under our current policies  we have utilized interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of our debt arrangements 
however  with the issuance of the fixed rate long term senior notes and repayment of the balance outstanding under the second amended and restated credit agreement in march  our exposure to interest rate changes will be limited to amounts which may be outstanding under our million fourth amended and restated credit agreement see liquidity and sources of capital 
the interest rate derivative entered into in october expired on december  depending upon the amounts outstanding under the fourth amended and restated credit agreement and without consideration of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges if any  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately  at december  the fair value of credit facilities approximates the carrying value except for the senior unsecured notes for which the fair value as determined based upon market quotes is million 
the carrying value of the senior unsecured notes is  at december
