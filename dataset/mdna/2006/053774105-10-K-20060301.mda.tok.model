item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we are one of the foremost providers of real estate and travel services in the world 
we operate our businesses within three divisions real estate  travel content and travel distribution 
our real estate division has only one segment  real estate services additionally  our former mortgage services segment was included in the real estate division  our travel content division has three segments hospitality services  timeshare resorts and vehicle rental  and our travel distribution division has only one segment  travel distribution services 
following is a brief description of the services provided by each of our business segments l real estate services franchises the real estate brokerage businesses of our four residential brands and one commercial brand  provides real estate brokerage services  facilitates employee relocations and provides home buyers with title and closing services 
l hospitality services franchises nine lodging brands  facilitates the exchange of vacation ownership intervals and markets vacation rental properties 
l timeshare resorts markets and sells vacation ownership interests  provides property management services to property owners associations  provides consumer financing to individuals purchasing vacation ownership interests and develops resort properties 
l vehicle rental operates and franchises our car and truck rental brands 
l travel distribution services provides global distribution services for the travel industry  corporate and consumer online travel agency services 
l mortgage services provided home buyers with mortgage lending services this business was disposed of in january see below for further discussion 
in  we continued the strategic realignment we commenced in early  which was undertaken to simplify our business model through exiting non core businesses or businesses that produced volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business model and the remainder of our core businesses 
we began this strategic realignment by completing the initial public offering of jackson hewitt tax service inc in june  raising million of cash  and acquiring orbitz  inc  an online travel company  for approximately billion in november we completed the spin off of our former mortgage  fleet leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax free distribution of the common stock of phh corporation to our stockholders in january in february  we completed an initial public offering of wright express corporation  raising million of cash  and acquired ebookers plc  a travel agency  for million 
we then completed the acquisitions of gullivers travel associates and octopus travel group limited collectively gullivers  a wholesaler and global online travel company  in april for approximately billion  and in october  we completed the sale of our marketing services division  which was comprised of our former individual membership and loyalty insurance marketing businesses  for approximately billion of cash approximately billion of gross proceeds  representing the culmination of our strategic realignment 
in connection with the completion of this strategic realignment  our management team and board of directors  with the aid of financial and legal advisors  performed a comprehensive review of the growth opportunities and current market valuations for each of our core businesses 
as a result of this review  during fourth quarter  our board of directors approved a plan to separate cendant into four independent  publicly traded companies l real estate services will encompass our current real estate services segment 
l hospitality services will encompass our current hospitality services and timeshare resorts segments 

table of contents l travel distribution will encompass our current travel distribution services segment 
l vehicle rental will encompass our current vehicle rental services segment 
we believe that this strategy provides the greatest opportunity for our businesses and brands to achieve their full potential 
additionally  we anticipate that the separation of our core businesses will facilitate a clearer understanding and more precise market valuation of each of these businesses 
the separation is expected to be effected through three spin offs and is expected to be tax free for cendant and its shareholders 
we expect to incur material costs in connection with executing this plan during these costs amounted to million 
we currently expect the spin off of the new real estate services company to occur in second quarter followed by the spin off of the new hospitality services company in third quarter the new travel distribution company is expected to be spun off in october there can be no assurances  however  that the plan of separation will be completed 
completion of the contemplated separation is subject to various risks 
for a discussion of these risks  see item a risk factors 
in the meantime  our management team remains committed to increasing shareholder value 
in  we used approximately billion of cash  net of proceeds from option exercises  to repurchase our common stock and million of cash to pay dividends 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares within the confines of our repurchase program 
additionally  our first quarter dividend payment of cents per share has already been approved by our board of directors 
the board has suspended any further cash dividends for the remainder of in anticipation of our separation plan 
the dividend policies relating to each of the new publicly traded companies will be determined by the boards of directors of such companies 
finally  we remain focused on growing profitability within each of these new companies before and after the separation 
to this end  we have established transition teams that are principally responsible for planning  organizing and implementing the series of transition services and other agreements that are going to be necessary to support the individual companies 
with these teams in place  our operating executives remain focused on delivering profitability and positioning our businesses for long term growth 
results of operations vs 
discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to segregate and report as discontinued operations for all periods presented the account balances and activities of jackson hewitt  our former fleet leasing and appraisal businesses  wright express  and our former marketing services division 
although we no longer own our former mortgage business  we cannot classify such business as a discontinued operation due to our participation in a mortgage origination venture that was established with phh in connection with our spin off of phh in january the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which is defined as income from continuing operations before non program related depreciation and amortization  non program related interest  amortization of pendings and listings  income taxes and minority interest 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents our consolidated results of operations are summarized as follows change net revenues total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain loss on disposals of discontinued operations  net of tax phh valuation and transaction related charges gain on disposals cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income net revenues and total expenses increased approximately billion and billion  respectively  in as compared with  reflecting organic revenue growth across all our segments  particularly within our vehicle rental and real estate services segments  the acquisitions of strategic businesses subsequent to january  and other items discussed below  including a million non cash impairment charge recorded within our travel distribution services segment and a million non cash valuation charge associated with our spin off of phh in january the largest contributor to organic revenue growth year over year was our vehicle rental segment  reflecting strong demand at both our domestic and international operations 
we experienced greater time and mileage revenue principally as a result of a increase in the number of days a car was rented domestically and a increase in the number of days a car was rented internationally 
our real estate services segment also experienced strong organic revenue growth year over year primarily as a result of a increase in the average price of home sales at our brokerage business  partially offset by a decrease in the number of homesale transactions 
revenues at our timeshare resorts segment also grew organically principally driven by a increase in tour flow  a increase in revenue per guest and increased consumer finance income 
organic growth at our hospitality services segment resulted from an increase in organic revenue per available room within our lodging business  as well as a increase in worldwide subscribers and a increase in points and rental transaction volume within our vacation exchange business 
we also experienced moderate organic revenue growth within our travel distribution services business primarily due to a increase in online gross bookings 
expenses increased throughout all of our core operating segments as a result of organic growth primarily to support additional volume  higher vehicle costs and additional marketing investments 
apart from organic growth  the strategic businesses we acquired subsequent to january  contributed to the year over year increase in net revenues and total expenses as follows contribution to contribution to acquired business date of acquisition net revenues total expenses orbitz a november gullivers b april ebookers c february landal greenparks d may real estate brokerages total contributions these businesses were acquired at various dates during or subsequent to a reflects the results of operations from january through november  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 

table of contents b reflects the results of operations from april through december  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 
c principally reflects the results of operations from february through december  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 
d principally reflects the results of operations from january through may  the corresponding period during which this business was not included during 
partially offsetting these revenue and expense increases was the absence of eleven months of revenues generated and expenses incurred by our former mortgage business  which was disposed of on january  our former mortgage business contributed million and million of revenues and expenses  respectively  to our results during the period february  through december  the increase in total expenses also reflects the following charges recorded during i a million million  after tax non cash impairment charge associated with our travel distribution businesses see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of this charge  ii a million non cash impairment charge relating to the phh spin off  iii charges aggregating million primarily relating to restructuring activities undertaken following the phh spin off and initial public offering of wright express and iv million of charges incurred in connection with our plan to separate cendant into four independent  public companies 
partially offsetting these charges is a decrease of million in interest expense primarily relating to the reversal of million of accrued interest associated with the resolution of amounts due under a litigation settlement reached in  as well as an overall reduction in debt extinguishment costs incurred in  which were partially offset by million of interest expense recorded in fourth quarter as a result of a legal settlement related to a claim against a business we acquired in our effective tax rate for continuing operations was and for and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate for was primarily due to the non deductibility of the valuation charge associated with the phh spin off and a one time tax expense associated with the planned repatriation of foreign earnings  which was partially offset by a tax benefit related to changes in tax basis differences in assets of foreign subsidiaries and a tax rate differential associated with the non cash impairment charge recorded within our travel distribution services segment 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations decreased million 
income from discontinued operations decreased million  which primarily reflects i a decrease of million due to net income generated by jackson hewitt prior to its disposition in june since its results were included for six months in but not at all in  ii a decrease of million due to net income generated by our former fleet leasing and appraisal businesses since their results were included for twelve months in but only one month in and due to a million tax related charge recorded in  iii a decrease of million due to net income generated by wright express since its results were included for twelve months in but only through february  in  and iv a decrease of million in net income generated by our marketing services division  which principally reflects the reversal of a tax valuation allowance of million in january  a million charge recorded during in connection with a breach of contract claim and the absence in of million of income recorded in in connection with the early termination of two contractual relationships with third party marketing partners and the sale of commission rights associated with long term preferred care insurance policies that were previously sold 
the net gain we recognized on the disposal of discontinued operations increased million year over year  which includes a million gain recognized in connection with the sale of our former marketing services division during and a million gain recognized during in connection with the initial public offering of wright express  partially offset by i a million non cash impairment charge and million of transaction costs relating to the phh spin off and ii the absence of a million gain recognized in connection with the june sale of jackson hewitt 
in  we also recorded a million million  after tax non cash charge to reflect the cumulative effect of accounting change as a result of our adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations in fourth quarter as a result of the above mentioned items  net income decreased million

a includes unallocated corporate overhead  the elimination of transactions between segments and the results of operations of certain non strategic businesses 
real estate services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with reflecting revenue growth across all of our real estate services businesses 
royalty revenue within our real estate franchise business increased million in as compared with such growth was primarily driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold and by a increase in the number of homesale transactions from our third party franchisees 
the period over period increase in average price is reflective of the supply of  and the demand for  homes in previous quarters  resulting in an overall increase in the sales prices of homes across the nation 
this trend has moderated recently as industry wide inventory levels have increased and the balance between supply and demand has returned to more normalized levels 
consistent with our growth strategy  we also earned million of additional revenue in connection with the license of the sotheby s brand name in certain countries or international regions 
in addition to royalties received from our third party franchisees  nrt incorporated  our wholly owned real estate brokerage firm  continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise business 
however  these intercompany royalties  which approximated million and million during and  respectively  are eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this segment s revenues or ebitda 
revenues within our real estate brokerage business increased million in as compared with such increase is partially attributable to significant acquisitions made by nrt during or subsequent to january   which together contributed incremental revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to operating results 
apart from these acquisitions  nrt s revenues increased million in as compared with this increase was substantially comprised of higher commission income earned on homesale transactions  which was primarily driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold  partially offset by a decline in the number of homesale transactions 
the period over period increase in average price is reflective of the supply of  and demand for  homes in previous quarters  resulting in an overall increase in the sales prices of homes across the nation 
this trend has moderated recently as industry wide inventory levels have increased and the balance between supply and demand has returned to more normalized levels 
ebitda further reflects an increase of million in 
table of contents commission expenses paid to real estate agents as a result of the incremental revenues earned on homesale transactions  as well as a higher average commission rate paid to real estate agents in due to the progressive nature of revenue based agent commission schedules 
nrt has a significant concentration of real estate brokerage offices and transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the us real estate market  particularly the east and west coasts 
the real estate franchise business has franchised offices that are more widely dispersed across the united states than our nrt real estate brokerage operations 
accordingly  operating results and homesale statistics may differ between nrt and the real estate franchise business based upon geographic presence and the corresponding homesale activity in each geographic region 
revenues from our relocation services business increased million during as compared with such increase was primarily driven by i million of increased referral fees due to higher referral rates and transaction volume and ii million of incremental management fees and commissions earned in our international services due to increased transaction volume 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in intercompany interest income 
revenues from our title and settlement services business increased million in as compared with this increase is primarily due to million of additional title and closing revenues resulting principally from increased resale volume and fees  partially offset by the absence of a previously reported million gain recorded on the sale of certain non core assets in ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in operating  marketing and administrative expenses apart from nrt s significant acquisitions and real estate agent commission expenses  both of which are discussed separately above principally resulting from i million of incremental expenses primarily representing inflationary increases in rent  office administration and other fixed costs within our real estate brokerage business  ii million of higher marketing expenses to support growth in our real estate franchise and brokerage operations  iii million of expenses incurred within our real estate brokerage business primarily to support an increased number of offices  iv a million increase in staffing and other personnel related costs incurred within our relocation business primarily to support increases in volume  v million of costs at our title and settlement services business related to developing and enhancing certain infrastructures that were previously maintained at and leveraged from our former mortgage business  vi million of costs within our title and settlement services business related to additional title and closing volume and vii million of expenses resulting from restructuring actions primarily within our title and settlement services and our real estate brokerage businesses 
hospitality services revenues increased million  while ebitda decreased million  in compared with reflecting revenue growth across all our hospitality businesses  however  the ebitda comparison was negatively impacted by costs incurred to combine the operations of our vacation exchange and rental businesses  a favorable settlement recorded in second quarter related to a lodging franchisee receivable and the inclusion in results of a highly seasonal business  which we acquired in may and  therefore  was not included in the comparable prior year period all of which are discussed in greater detail below 
the operating results of our lodging business reflect the acquisitions of wyndham worldwide in october and ramada international in december the operating results of wyndham have been included in our results for three of the twelve months of  but none of the operating results of ramada have been included in our results for the entire twelve months of  but only for one month of accordingly  wyndham and ramada contributed incremental revenues of million and million  respectively  and ebitda of million each to results 
included within the million of revenue generated by wyndham is approximately million related to reimbursable expenses  which has no impact on ebitda 
these acquisitions also added approximately  rooms  which is approximately of the total weighted average rooms available within our lodging franchise system during apart from these acquisitions  revenues in our lodging business increased million 
such increase principally 
table of contents represents i million of higher royalty  marketing and reservation fund revenues  ii million of incremental revenues generated by our triprewards loyalty program during and iii a million gain recognized on the sale of a lodging related investment during the million increase in royalty  marketing and reservation fund revenues primarily resulted from an increase in revenue per available room revpar  partially offset by a decrease in weighted average rooms available 
the revpar increase reflects i increases in both price and occupancy principally attributable to an overall improvement in the economy lodging segment in which our hotel brands primarily operate  ii the termination of underperforming properties throughout that did not meet our required quality standards or their financial obligations to us and iii the strategic assignment of personnel to field locations designed to assist franchisees in improving their hotel operating performance 
the decrease in weighted average rooms available reflects our termination of underperforming properties  as discussed above  the expiration of franchise agreements and certain franchisees exercising their right to terminate their agreement 
revenues within our vacation exchange business increased million during due to a million increase in exchange and subscription fee revenues and a million increase in other timeshare points and rental transaction revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in other transactional revenues 
the increase in exchange and subscription fee revenues in was primarily driven by a increase in the average number of worldwide subscribers and a increase in the average exchange fee  partially offset by a decrease in exchange transaction volumes 
the increase in other timeshare points and rental transaction revenues during was principally driven by a increase in points and rental transaction volume  partially offset by a decrease in the average price per rental transaction 
the decrease in other transactional revenues in was primarily due to the absence of travel related commission fees and higher cancellation fees received in revenue trends reflect the continued shift in the rci timeshare membership base toward a greater mix of points members from traditional one week timeshare members 
within our vacation rental business  we acquired landal greenparks and canvas holidays limited  which are both european vacation rental businesses  in may and october  respectively 
the operating results of landal have been included in our results for the entire twelve months in but for only eight months in the operating results of canvas have been included in our results for the entire twelve months in but for only three months in accordingly  landal and canvas contributed incremental revenues of million and million  respectively  and incremental ebitda loss earnings of million and million  respectively  during the decline in ebitda at landal primarily reflects the fact that landal s results in do not include its seasonally weakest quarter  as it was not acquired until may apart from these acquisitions  revenues at our european vacation rental companies increased million due to the conversion of a franchised park to a managed park as we previously received only a franchise fee and now have the full benefit of revenue generated by this park 
this revenue increase was offset by incremental revenue deferred in on the rental of camping properties  which will be recognized in upon arrival of campsite customers 
ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in operating  marketing and administrative expenses excluding the impact of the acquisitions discussed above principally resulting from i million of higher bad debt expense primarily due to the absence of a favorable million settlement recorded in related to a lodging franchisee receivable  ii million of costs incurred to combine the operations of our vacation exchange and rental businesses  iii million of marketing related expenses primarily related to marketing initiatives within our vacation exchange and lodging businesses  iv the utilization of million of incremental revenues generated by our triprewards loyalty program to fund related marketing initiatives  v million of incremental expenses associated with the conversion of a franchised park to a managed park  as discussed above  vi million of variable operating expenses primarily resulting from higher transaction volume within our vacation exchange business and vii million of restructuring costs incurred as a result of the consolidation of certain call centers and back office functions 

table of contents timeshare resorts revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with the ebitda comparison was negatively impacted by million of expenses incurred during to account for the estimated impact of the hurricanes experienced along the gulf coast 
revenue and ebitda  exclusive of the impact of the gulf coast hurricanes  reflect organic growth in timeshare sales  a gain on the sale of land and increased consumer finance income 
net sales of vacation ownership interests vois at our timeshare resorts business increased million in despite the gulf coast hurricanes 
such increase was principally driven by a increase in tour flow and a increase in revenue per guest 
this revenue increase includes a million decrease in higher margin upgrade sales at our trendwest resort properties due to special upgrade promotions conducted during undertaken to mitigate the negative impact on tour flow from the do not call legislation 
tour flow  as well as revenue per transaction  benefited in from our expanded presence in premium destinations such as hawaii  las vegas and orlando 
tour flow was also positively impacted by the opening of new sales offices  our strategic focus on new marketing alliances and increased local marketing efforts 
revenue and ebitda also increased million and million  respectively  in as a result of incremental net interest income earned on our contract receivables primarily due to i growth in the consolidated portfolio without corresponding increases in net borrowing costs and ii more favorable valuation adjustments in to our retained interest in securitized contract receivables 
revenue and ebitda comparisons further benefited from an million gain recorded in in connection with the disposal of a parcel of land that was no longer consistent with our development plans  partially offset by the absence of a million gain recognized in first quarter in connection with the sale of a third party timeshare financing operation and million of revenue generated by such operations in prior to the sale date 
ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in operating  marketing and administrative expenses primarily resulting from i million of additional commission expense associated with increased voi sales and increased commission rates  ii million of additional contract receivable provisions recorded in  iii million of increased cost of sales associated with increased voi sales  iv million of additional costs incurred primarily to fund additional staffing needs to support continued growth in the business  improve existing properties and integrate the trendwest and fairfield contract servicing systems  v million of incremental marketing spend to support sales efforts and anticipated growth in the business and vi million of expenses associated with the gulf coast hurricanes  which primarily reflects a provision for estimated timeshare contract receivable losses 
vehicle rental revenues increased million  while ebitda decreased million in compared with we experienced strong demand for vehicle rentals throughout the year and expect rental volumes to continue to grow in the foreseeable future  however  ebitda margin comparisons were negatively impacted by lower domestic rental car pricing  higher fleet costs and damage to vehicles as a result of the hurricanes experienced in the gulf coast during september revenues generated by our domestic car rental operations increased million during  which was comprised of a million increase in time and mileage t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in the number of days a car was rented  partially offset by a decrease in t m revenue per day 
the increase in rental days reflects  in part  our strategic decision to implement more competitive pricing in the second half of this program was continued into the first half of when we instituted a price increase in response to rising fleet costs 
accordingly  t m revenue per day decreased during when compared with but increased by six percentage points in third quarter when compared with second quarter and by one percentage point in fourth quarter when compared with third quarter we expect further price increases along with continued volume gains in as we seek to offset the impact of higher fleet costs and anticipated increases in interest costs  which we began to experience in the second half 
table of contents of pricing was also negatively impacted during by competitive conditions in the domestic car rental industry resulting from higher industry wide fleet levels  which we believe were caused by enhanced incentives offered by car manufacturers in prior periods 
fleet depreciation increased million in primarily due to i an increase of in the average size of our domestic rental fleet and ii reductions to manufacturer incentives received on our model year inventory which was in utilization during as compared with those received on our model year inventory which was in utilization during 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  ii a million increase in gasoline revenues and iii a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items 
ebitda from our domestic car rental operations also reflects i million of additional expenses primarily associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  including vehicle maintenance and damage costs  commissions  shuttling costs and funding costs on vehicle purchases  ii million of increased expenses associated with higher airport concession and vehicle licensing fees  iii million of increased expenses associated with higher gasoline costs  iv million of additional vehicle interest expense incurred to grow our fleet size  v million of incremental expenses relating to the estimated damages caused by the hurricanes experienced in the gulf coast in  which primarily included the impairment of rental cars  some of which may be recovered in future periods  and vi million of additional litigation expense resulting from the settlement of a dispute with licensees of our avis brand arising out of our acquisition of the budget business in revenues generated by our international car rental operations increased million due to an million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in the number of days a car was rented and a increase in t m revenue per day 
the increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was partially offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and related costs and million of higher operating expenses  both principally resulting from increased car rental volume and an increase of in the average size of our international rental fleet to support such volume 
additionally  ebitda reflects a million increase in expenses associated with higher airport concession and vehicle licensing fees 
the increase in revenue generated by our international car rental operations includes the effect of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million  which was principally offset in ebitda by the opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on expenses 
we have negotiated the purchase of our model year inventory and expect to incur increased fleet depreciation costs throughout accordingly  our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods will be dependent on our ability to successfully reflect corresponding changes in our pricing program 
budget truck rental revenues increased million in primarily representing an million increase in t m revenue  which reflects a increase in t m per day and a modest increase in rental days 
in addition to increased t m revenue  ebitda was also favorably impacted by a million credit relating to a refinement made during in how we estimate repair and refurbishment costs of our truck fleet 
we also recognized a million credit relating to an adjustment of our self insurance reserve for public liability and property damage as a result of more favorable claims experience as indicated by an actuarial valuation of our self insurance obligation  which is performed annually 
the favorable impact on ebitda was offset by i million of incremental fleet depreciation and related costs principally resulting from a increase in the average size of our truck rental fleet in anticipation of increased demand and ii million of restructuring costs  representing facility  employee relocation and severance costs incurred in connection with the closure of a reservation center and unprofitable budget truck rental locations 
travel distribution services revenues increased million and ebitda decreased million  respectively  in compared with  reflecting the inclusion of revenues and expenses from recent acquisitions 
however  the ebitda comparison was negatively impacted by a million impairment charge principally associated with our online consumer travel businesses  as well as million of integration costs associated with acquisitions 

table of contents in november  we completed the acquisition of orbitz  and in  we acquired gullivers april  ebookers february and another online travel business 
the operating results of these companies have been included in our results from their respective acquisition dates forward and therefore were incremental to our results during accordingly  orbitz  gullivers  ebookers and the other online travel business contributed incremental revenues of million  million  million and million  respectively  and ebitda earnings losses of million  million  million and million  respectively  prior to the allocation of the million impairment charge discussed below 
in addition  effective january   we transferred our membership travel business to the discontinued marketing services segment 
as a result  revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  generated by such operations in were absent from this segment s results in the same period in apart from these acquisitions and the transfer of the membership travel business  revenue increased million and ebitda decreased million 
galileo and our supplier services businesses  which primarily provide global distribution services to the travel industry  experienced an overall million increase in revenues  primarily driven by a million increase in worldwide air booking fees and million of additional ancillary revenue  which were substantially offset by a million decline in subscriber fees 
the increase in air booking fees was comprised of a million increase in international air booking fees  partially offset by an million decrease in domestic air booking fees 
the increase in international air booking fees was principally driven by higher booking volumes  which totaled million segments during and which primarily resulted from an increase in travel demand within the middle east and the asia pacific regions  offset in part by a decline in demand in europe 
the million decrease in domestic air booking fees was driven by an decline in the effective yield on such bookings  partially offset by a increase in booking volumes  which totaled million segments during the domestic volume increase and effective yield decline are consistent with our pricing program with major us carriers  which was designed to gain access to all public fares made available by the participating airlines 
international air bookings represented approximately two thirds of our total air bookings during the million reduction in subscriber fees reflects the continuing trend of fewer travel agencies leasing computer equipment from us during compared with the million of additional ancillary revenue includes higher fees earned on outsourcing arrangements where we provide technology services for certain airlines 
apart from the acquisitions described above  revenues generated from our online and traditional travel agency businesses increased million primarily due to a increase in online gross bookings  principally at our cheaptickets 
com website 
we believe this increase is primarily attributable to improved site functionality  which resulted in greater conversion rates  and enhanced content 
ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in expenses excluding the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions and the transfer of the membership travel business primarily resulting from a million impairment charge principally associated with our online travel businesses see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of this charge 
the remaining increase in expenses primarily resulted from  i the absence in of a million expense reduction realized in in connection with a benefit plan amendment  ii million of incremental employee severance costs  including million of executive severance  million related to the integration of recently acquired businesses and million related to restructuring actions taken to reduce staff levels in some of our online travel businesses and the realignment of our global sales force  iii million of higher commissions attributable to higher booking volumes  principally in the middle east and asia pacific regions and a greater mix of booking volumes in higher commission rate countries iv million of additional expenses associated with developing enhanced technology and other project initiatives 
such amounts were partially offset by i a million reduction in costs primarily realized at our cheaptickets 
com and lodging 
com businesses  as a result of integration efforts executed domestically  including the migration of technology to a common platform and ii million of expense savings on network communications and equipment maintenance and installation due  in part  to reduced volume within the galileo subscriber business where travel agents lease computer equipment from us 

table of contents mortgage services revenues and ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  in compared with as a result of the spin off of phh  results include only one month of activity while consisted of twelve months 
our former mortgage operations generated revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the eleven month period ended december  for the month of january  revenue increased million and ebitda decreased million in compared with the ebitda reduction was primarily due to an expected non cash impairment charge of million recorded in january to reflect a portion of the difference between the carrying value and initial market value of phh as a result of the spin off 
in connection with the spin off  we formed a venture with phh to continue to participate in the earnings generated from originating mortgages for customers of our real estate brokerage and relocation business 
we own of the venture and phh owns 
amounts recorded during within our real estate services segment were not material as the venture did not become operational until fourth quarter phh manages this venture and retains all risk related to the mortgage servicing asset 
corporate and other revenues decreased million and the ebitda loss increased from million in to million in revenues and ebitda were unfavorably impacted in by a million reduction to realized gains on the sale of homestore stock during compared with and a million reduction in earnings on a credit card marketing program under which we earn fees based on a percentage of credit card spending 
such amounts were partially offset by a million reduction in intersegment revenue eliminations in due to decreased intercompany business activities and million of incremental revenues earned in under agreements where we provide certain transitional administrative services to businesses we recently sold or distributed including jackson hewitt  our former fleet leasing and mortgage business and our former marketing services division 
ebitda was further unfavorably impacted year over year by i the absence of a million credit recorded in in connection with previously established liabilities for severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believed we were liable  ii million in expenses recorded during in connection with our separation plan and iii a credit of million in relating to the termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally estimated 
results of operations vs 
our consolidated results of operations are summarized as follows change net revenues total expenses income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income 
table of contents net revenues increased approximately billion in as compared with due principally to growth in our core residential real estate and travel businesses  which also contributed to the increase in total expenses to support the increased volume of underlying transactions 
the acquisitions of several strategic businesses  primarily within the real estate and travel verticals in which are discussed in greater detail below  also contributed to the increases in revenues and expenses  as their results are included from their respective acquisition dates forward 
these increases were partially offset by an expected decline in both revenues generated and expenses incurred by our mortgage business  as expected  due to reduced mortgage refinancing activity experienced industry wide 
additionally offsetting the above mentioned increases in expenses was a reduction of million in interest expense during  which principally reflected a decrease in losses incurred in connection with our early extinguishments of debt and an overall reduction in our outstanding debt  as well as million of interest received in connection with a federal tax refund 
in addition  we recorded a net credit of million during in connection with the resolution of certain legal matters relating to the discovery of accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc international  inc  whereas we incurred million of expense during such change principally reflects million of previously established liabilities relating to severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable  partially offset by additional costs related to the ongoing investigations into the cuc accounting irregularities 
our overall effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to the absence in of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards in  partially offset by a reduction to our tax contingency reserve primarily resulting from audit settlements in and taxes on the redemption of our mandatorily redeemable preferred interest in as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million 
income from discontinued operations increased million  reflecting i an increase of million in net income generated by jackson hewitt prior to its disposition  ii an increase of million in net income generated by our former fleet leasing and appraisal businesses  iii an increase of million in net income generated by wright express and iv an increase of million in net income generated by our marketing services division  which principally reflects the reversal of a tax valuation allowance of million in january  and million of income recorded in in connection with the early termination of two contractual relationships with third party marketing partners and a gain on the sale of commission rights associated with long term preferred care insurance policies that were previously sold  partially offset by a million cash payment the company made to trl group in connection with the january contract termination see note trl group  inc

real estate services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  reflecting growth across all of our real estate businesses 
our real estate franchise business generated million of royalties and marketing fund revenues during as compared with million during  an increase of million 
such growth was primarily driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold and an increase in the number of homesale transactions  partially offset by an increase in volume incentives paid to our largest independent brokers 
in addition to royalties received from our third party franchise affiliates  nrt  our wholly owned real estate brokerage firm  continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise business 
however  these intercompany royalties  which approximated million and million for and  respectively  are eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this segment s revenues or ebitda 
nrt made acquisitions of various real estate brokerage businesses during and for which the operating results have been included from their acquisition dates forward 
nrt s significant acquisitions  including sotheby s international realty  contributed million and million of incremental revenues and ebitda  respectively  to the operating results for excluding the impact of these significant acquisitions  nrt generated incremental revenues of million in  a increase over this increase was substantially comprised of higher commission income earned on homesale transactions  which was substantially driven by a increase in the average price of homes sold 
the year over year increase in average price was driven by an overall industry wide increase in the market prices of homes and stronger volume of higher priced homesales in compared with commission expenses paid to real estate agents increased million as a result of the incremental revenues earned on homesale transactions as well as a higher average commission rate paid to real estate agents in due to variances in the geographic mix of homesales and the progressive nature of agent commission schedules 

table of contents revenues from our relocation services business increased million principally resulting from higher referral fees  which were driven by an increased volume of relocation referrals and a higher average fee per referral as home values have increased year over year 
revenues within our title and settlement services business declined million  which principally reflects a million decline due to lower volumes also consistent with the expected decline in mortgage refinancing volume  partially offset by a million gain recorded on the sale of certain non core assets in first quarter marketing  operating and administrative expenses apart from the nrt acquisitions and real estate agent commission expenses  both of which are discussed separately above increased approximately million  principally reflecting an increase in variable expenses associated with higher nrt homesale revenue and growth in our relocation services business  as discussed above 
hospitality services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with in may  we completed the acquisition of landal greenparks 
during  landal contributed million to revenues and million to ebitda 
in october  we completed the acquisition of canvas holidays limited 
during  canvas holidays contributed million to revenues and million to ebitda 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding these acquisitions 
apart from the landal and canvas holidays acquisitions  revenues at our european vacation rental companies increased million in substantially due to a favorable impact on revenues from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which were substantially offset in ebitda by the unfavorable impact of exchange rate movements on expenses 
royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations increased million in primarily due to a increase in revenue per available room and a basis point increase in the net effective royalty rate  partially offset by a reduction in room count 
these changes reflect quality control initiatives implemented in whereby we terminated from our franchise system certain properties that were not meeting required standards and tightened requirements for properties not meeting their financial obligations to us 
additionally  in fourth quarter we launched triprewards  a loyalty program that enables customers to earn rewards when staying at cendant s lodging brand hotels or when purchasing services or products from program partners 
the triprewards program enables us to earn fees on revenues generated by our franchisees from triprewards members 
the program contributed million of incremental revenue during  which was substantially offset in ebitda by increased marketing expenditures to promote our lodging brands  the funding of the cost of rewards earned by customers and program administrative expenses 
exchange and subscription fee revenues within our vacation exchange business increased million during despite the hurricanes that hit north america and the caribbean during the third quarter of  the effects of which were felt throughout the remainder of the year 
such growth was primarily driven by i a increase in the average number of worldwide subscribers  ii a increase in the average subscription price per member and iii a increase in the average exchange fee  partially offset by a reduction in exchange transaction volume 
timeshare points and rental transaction revenue rentals of unused timeshare inventory grew million driven principally by an increase in points and rental transaction volume and a increase in the average price per rental transaction 
revenue trends reflect the expected shift in the membership base toward a greater mix of points members from traditional one week timeshare members 
in addition  our vacation exchange business generated incremental revenue of million due to an increase in travel related services provided to customers of our international membership business 
operating  marketing and administrative expenses  excluding expenses generated by landal and canvas holidays and other expense variances discussed separately above  increased approximately million in principally reflecting higher variable costs incurred to support increased revenues and increased costs associated with prior period acquisitions in our vacation rental business  partially offset by favorable bad debt 
table of contents expense period over period related to the settlement of a lodging franchisee receivable during that had been previously reserved for during timeshare resorts revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with net sales of vois in our timeshare resorts increased million in  an increase over despite the hurricanes that hit north america and the caribbean during the third quarter of  which negatively impacted voi sales in our southeastern properties in the second half of the net increase in voi sales in our timeshare resorts was primarily driven by an increase in the average price per voi sales transaction as well as a million increase in upgrade sales at our trendwest resort properties  partially offset by a reduction in tour flow and a million reduction in the recognition of voi deferred revenues related to resort properties under construction 
revenues and certain related costs recognized on voi sales at resort properties under construction are done so using the percentage of completion method of accounting and accordingly  are deferred and recognized in future periods as the resort properties are completed 
the number of tours in was negatively impacted by do not call legislation  which became effective in october and reduced telemarketers ability to call consumers at home unless a preexisting relationship existed 
during  we sold certain of our timeshare resort properties and recognized gains on sale of million 
additionally  incremental resort management fees of million were generated through increased rental revenues on unoccupied units as well as growth in the number of units under management during revenue also increased million  while ebitda declined million in  primarily as a result of consolidating our largest timeshare receivable securitization structures during third quarter and year over year growth in our contract receivables portfolio 
the consolidation of the securitization structures resulted in the recognition of interest revenues on contract receivables and interest expense incurred on the debt funding of such contracts instead of applying gain on sale accounting to such securitizations  prior to consolidation 
accordingly  as a result of the consolidation  as well as the year over year growth in the contract receivables portfolio  interest revenue generated in exceeded the interest revenue recognized and the gain on sale accounting applied to securitizations in ebitda  however  was negatively impacted by the absence of gain on sale accounting in  partially offset by the net interest income recognized in in connection with the consolidation and subsequent growth of the contract receivable portfolio 
operating  marketing and administrative expenses within this segment  excluding the effect of consolidating our largest timeshare receivable securitization structures  increased approximately million in principally reflecting higher variable costs incurred to support increased revenues  partially offset by favorable cost of sales and commissions as a percentage of related voi revenues 
vehicle rental revenue and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with avis car rental revenues increased million in which was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenues was principally driven by a increase in the number of days an avis vehicle was rented 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenue  ii a million increase in gasoline revenues  which resulted from increased gas prices in  and iii a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items 
the overall revenue change of million is also inclusive of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations internationally which positively impacted revenue  but was principally offset in ebitda by the effect of such exchange rate movements on expenses 
budget car rental revenues increased million in due to a increase in car rental t m revenue  which was driven by a increase in car rental days  partially offset by a reduction in t m revenue per day 
this reflects  in part  the resulting impact of our strategic decision to reposition the budget car rental brand by reducing the cost structure and pricing to be more competitive with other leisure focused car rental 
table of contents brands 
the overall revenue change of million is also inclusive of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which positively impacted revenue  but was principally offset in ebitda by the effect of such exchange rate movements on expenses 
pricing at both our avis and budget car rental brands during was negatively impacted by competitive conditions in the car rental industry as a result of higher industry wide fleet levels  which we believed were caused by enhanced incentives offered by car manufacturers 
however  such manufacturer incentives also resulted in lower fleet costs  which significantly offset the ebitda impact of lower pricing 
budget truck rental revenues increased million in comprised of a million increase in t m revenue  partially offsetting a million reduction in other ancillary revenues 
the additional budget truck rental t m revenue reflects a reduction in rental days offset by a increase in t m per day 
during  we reduced the average budget truck fleet by compared with the average fleet size in  which reflected our efforts to focus on higher utilization of newer and more efficient trucks 
total expenses within this segment decreased approximately million on a revenue increase of million 
the favorable profit margin primarily resulted from continued operating efficiencies realized in connection with the successful integration of budget  increased internet reservation activity resulting in reduced call volume and associated costs and commissions and favorable insurance costs as a result of the reduction in higher risk budget car rentals  as discussed above 
travel distribution services revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  which includes the operating results of orbitz  which was acquired in november the operating results of orbitz were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed revenues of million and an ebitda loss of million to results 
the ebitda loss incurred by orbitz is partly reflective of integration costs incurred to combine the technology platforms and operations of our orbitz  cheaptickets and travelport businesses to form one common platform and expand our travel distribution capabilities 
in addition  five other subsidiaries specializing in online travel and travel packaging and consolidation  which were acquired in and  impacted the year over year comparison as their operating results were included from their acquisition dates forward 
such acquisitions collectively contributed incremental revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  to the results 
galileo generated million of incremental worldwide air booking fees in as international air booking fees increased million  while domestic air booking fees decreased million 
the increase in international air booking fees was driven by a increase in the effective yield on such bookings and a increase in booking volumes  which rose to million segments for the yield increase partially resulted from a greater number of premium booking transactions that allow customers additional itinerary options 
international booking volume in was suppressed by reduced travel in europe during the second half of  which was due in part to labor uncertainties surrounding an air carrier in italy with whom our galileo subsidiary conducts business  which was resolved in late international air bookings represented approximately two thirds of our total air bookings during and the reduction in domestic air booking fees was driven by a decline in the effective yield partially offset by a increase in booking volumes  which reached million segments in the effective yield decline and increase in volume on domestic air bookings is consistent with our pricing program with major us carriers in order to gain access to all public fares made available by the participating airlines 
additionally  revenues and ebitda include a million reduction in subscriber fees resulting from fewer travel agencies leasing computer equipment from us during compared with and a million decrease in information services revenue  which are primarily sales of competitive airline fare information 
commensurate with our strategic focus to further penetrate online channels in the travel industry  including shifting some of our offline travel agency bookings to the online channel  online net revenues grew million organically excluding the impact of acquisitions in compared with driven by a increase in online gross bookings substantially within our cheaptickets 
com website while our offline travel agency net revenues decreased million 
the growth in online gross bookings was attributable to 
table of contents improved site functionality leading to increased conversion  enhanced content  which included additional hotel offerings in the online market  and more visitors resulting from increased marketing efforts 
excluding the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions  expenses within this segment increased approximately million in expense increases year over year included i million of higher commission expenses  primarily due to a greater number and mix of bookings during in countries with higher commission rates  ii million of increased market incentive costs  used in promoting our services to travel agencies  iii million of expense related to airline fare guarantees and iv million of increased bad debt expense  the majority of which was related to receivables from airlines in bankruptcy 
this was partially offset by cost savings from expense reductions  including network communication and maintenance and installation expense savings due  in part  to reduced subscriber volume 
in addition  there was a net reduction in salary and benefit related expenses in due in part  to the favorable impact in from benefit plan amendments that occurred in and cost benefits realized in from shifting our offline travel agency operations to online channels  which included the closure of certain call centers 
mortgage services revenues and ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  in compared with primarily due to the expected decline in refinancing activity experienced industry wide  partially offset by increased revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
mortgage refinancing closings were approximately billion lower in than in refinancing activity is sensitive to interest rate changes relative to borrowers current interest rates and typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise 
the year ended december  was marked by historically high refinancing activity  which decreased the propensity for borrowers to refinance during this factor along with increased competitive pricing pressures due to lower industry volumes caused revenue from mortgage loan production to decrease 
typically  as refinancing activity declines  borrower prepayments also decline  which generally resulted in an increase in the value of the mortgage servicing rights msr asset  all other factors being equal 
mortgage production revenue in any given year was driven by a mix of mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold 
the following chart presents our production revenues from originated mortgage loans held for sale which are generated at the time of sale and fee based mortgage originations where we performed outsourced mortgage origination functions for a fee which was generated at the time of closing change change loan closings and loan sales in billions loans closed to be securitized fee based loan closings total closings loan sales production revenue in millions production revenue from loan sales fee based production revenue total production revenue partially offsetting the decrease in production revenue was an increase of million in net revenues generated from servicing mortgage loans 
this increase reflects i a million net reduction in amortization expense and provision for impairment related to our msr asset  net of derivative results  which is primarily attributable to lower prepayment rates experienced in compared with driven by the decrease in refinancing activity in  ii a million increase in gross recurring servicing fees fees received for servicing existing loans in the portfolio driven by a increase in the average servicing portfolio  which rose to approximately billion in and iii a million increase in other servicing revenue 

table of contents operating expenses within this segment declined approximately million in primarily due to the decline in refinancing activity discussed above 
corporate and other revenues increased million and the ebitda loss decreased from million in to million in revenues and ebitda were favorably impacted in by million of additional realized gains on the sale of homestore stock  partially offset by a million gain recognized in on the sale of our equity investment in entertainment publications  inc revenue and ebitda also reflect million and million  respectively  of incremental earnings on a credit card marketing program under which we earn fees based on a percentage of credit card spending 
partially offsetting this revenue increase is million of incremental intersegment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities 
ebitda was also favorably impacted year over year by i a million reduction in securities related litigation charges in compared with principally resulting from a credit of million in relating to previously established liabilities for severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable  partially offset by ongoing investigation costs relating to the discovery in of accounting irregularities in former cuc businesses and ii a credit of million in relating to the termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally estimated 
these favorable ebitda variances were partially offset by a million increase in incentive based compensation expenses

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities  as well as available funding arrangements and committed credit facilities  each of which is discussed below

additionally  the vehicle rental business is expected to establish its own debt facilities and borrowings to augment its existing asset backed program 
liquidity risk we believe that access to our existing financing arrangements is sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future prior to the full or partial completion of our planned separation into four independent publicly traded companies 
prior to  or in connection with any such separation  our existing financing arrangements will be revised or replaced so that our financing arrangements will remain sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we can make no assurances that any such restructuring will be completed and we expect financing costs to increase for some  if not all  of the new stand alone companies 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in any one of the industries in which we operate 
additionally  our liquidity as it relates to management programs  could be adversely affected by i the deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of such programs  ii increased costs associated with the principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries if general motors corporation or ford motor company should not be able to honor its obligations to repurchase the related vehicles and iii the restructuring of any of our existing financing arrangements resulting from our plan to separate into four independent publicly traded companies 
access to our credit facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain financial ratios or as a result of the restructuring of such facilities resulting from our contemplated separation or under the terms of such restructured facilities

also not reflected in the above table are costs associated with the planned separation of cendant into four independent publicly traded companies 
accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when 
table of contents determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately billion and approximately billion  respectively  at december  these amounts reflect the fourth quarter impairment charge recorded at our travel distribution services segment 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
we provide a wide range of consumer and business services and  as a result  our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among many diverse reporting units 
accordingly  it is difficult to quantify the impact of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows  as such change may be isolated to a small number of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization 
in either case  the magnitude of any impairment to goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from adverse changes cannot be estimated 
however  our businesses are concentrated in a few industries and  as a result  an adverse change to any of these industries will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
we establish reserves for tax treatments when  despite our belief that the treatments are fully supportable  certain treatments are likely to be challenged and where we may not succeed in defending our position 
we adjust our reserves upon the closing of a tax audit  which in some cases can occur several years following the related transaction or the filing of the tax return under examination  or upon the occurrence of other changes in facts and circumstances that indicate an adjustment may be necessary including subsequent rulings and interpretations by tax authorities or court decisions on similar matters 
changes to the reserves could materially impact our results of operations 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the 
table of contents underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  we used these financial instruments  as well as forward delivery commitments  to manage and reduce interest rate risk inherent in our former mortgage business and specifically relating to the committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
l interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure at december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
l we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
the fair values of relocation receivables and equity advances on homes approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of timeshare receivables and our retained interests in securitized assets 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these 
table of contents models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december   and our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
