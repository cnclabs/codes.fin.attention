the company s international smokeless tobacco operations  which are not significant  are reported as all other operations 
the company s objective in the smokeless tobacco segment is to continue to grow the moist smokeless tobacco category by building awareness and social acceptability of smokeless tobacco products among adult smokers and by being competitive in every moist smokeless tobacco category segment 
over the past several years  industry trends have shown that some adult consumers have migrated from premium brands to brands in the price value and sub price value segments 
as such  a key to the company s future growth and profitability is attracting growing numbers of adult consumers  primarily smokers  as approximately every percent of adult smokers who convert to moist smokeless tobacco represents a percent increase in the segment s adult consumer base  and consumer research indicates that the majority of new adult consumers enter the category in the premium segment 
in addition to advertising initiatives focused on category growth  in the company initiated a direct mail program to over one million adult smokers and began an advertising campaign to promote the convenience of smokeless tobacco relative to cigarettes 
as a result of its success in  the direct mail program was repeated in while the company remains committed to its category growth initiatives  it is also focused on efforts to increase adult consumer loyalty within the premium segment of the moist smokeless tobacco category 
these efforts are designed to deliver value to these adult consumers through promotional spending and other price focused initiatives

the environment in which the company s wine segment operates is very competitive  and has been subject to recent industry consolidation 
additionally  changes in the supply of grapes  as well as changes in consumer preferences  have affected and may continue to affect this environment 
the impact of industry wide grape oversupply  which k arose as the result of increased vineyard plantings in the late s  has begun to subside  however  recent reports show large harvests in california and australia 
in addition  recent data indicate that adult per capita wine consumption in the united states is at an all time high  and that the wine category is expanding more rapidly than the other segments of the alcohol beverage industry 
as a result  the company remains focused on the continued expansion of its sales force and category management staff to broaden the distribution of its wine in the domestic market  especially in certain account categories such as restaurants  wholesale chains and mass merchandisers 
sustained growth in the wine segment will also be dependent on the successful introduction of new products and extension of existing product lines

the wine segment forecasts continued growth in despite several challenges that lie ahead 
in  domestic oversupply issues were somewhat alleviated  as california bulk wine inventories declined  however  oversupply in australia grew considerably and poses the most significant risk to short term pricing at retail

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
in addition  estimates affect the determination of contingent assets and liabilities and their related disclosure 
the company bases its estimates on a number of factors  including historical information and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates in the event there are changes in related conditions or assumptions 
the development and selection of the disclosed estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical  as they require accounting estimates to be made based upon matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimates are made 
k the company carries significant amounts of leaf tobacco  as well as bulk and bottled wine  as a result of the aging process required in the production of its moist smokeless tobacco and wine products  respectively 
the carrying value of these inventories includes management s assessment of their estimated net realizable values 
management reviews these inventories to make judgments for potential write downs for slow moving  unsaleable or obsolete inventories  to reflect such inventories at the lower of cost or market 
factors considered in management s assessment include  but are not limited to  evaluation of cost trends  changes in customer demands  product pricing  physical deterioration and overall product quality 
amounts recognized in the financial statements for the company s noncontributory defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including those for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation 
the company evaluates these assumptions on an annual basis and considers adjustments to the applicable long term factors based upon current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
changes in the related pension expense may occur in the future as a result of changes in these assumptions 
pension expense was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on average  over the past three years  approximately percent of pension expense was reflected in selling  advertising and administrative expenses  while the remainder was included in cost of products sold 
the slight decrease in pension expense for was primarily a result of increased expected returns on a higher asset base  partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent 
the company believes the long term rate of return of percent is reasonable based upon the plans asset composition and information available at the time  along with consideration of historical trends 
the company used a discount rate of percent to calculate its pension liabilities at december  this rate approximates the rate at which current pension liabilities could effectively be settled 
at december   unrecognized actuarial losses  including those associated with pension plan asset performance  were approximately million 
these losses will be amortized over the applicable remaining service period which is approximately years 
the company made a discretionary contribution of million to its qualified pension plans in the impact of a lower discount rate  partially offset by lower actuarial losses  is expected to result in higher pension expense for the following provides a sensitivity analysis  which demonstrates the effects that adverse changes in actuarial assumptions would have had on pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately million  while the same basis point decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase of approximately million 
the company maintains a number of other postretirement welfare benefit plans which provide certain medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all full time employees who have completed specified age and service requirements upon retirement 
amounts recognized in the financial statements in connection with these other postretirement benefit plans are determined utilizing actuarial valuations 
the key assumptions inherent in these valuations include health care cost trend rates and the discount rate used in calculating the applicable postretirement benefit obligation  each of which are evaluated by the company on an annual basis 
future changes in the related postretirement benefit expense may be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
the company used a discount rate of percent to calculate its postretirement benefit obligation at december   which approximates the rate at which current postretirement benefit liabilities could effectively be settled 
the health care cost trend increase used in calculating the postretirement benefit obligation at december  is assumed to be percent in and is expected to decrease gradually to percent by and remain level thereafter 
a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the impact that a basis point increase or decrease in these rates would have on both the postretirement benefit obligation and the related expense is disclosed in the employee benefit and compensation plans note to the consolidated financial statements 
expense related to these plans was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s primary business  which is the manufacture and sale of moist smokeless tobacco  sells products with freshness dates 
it is the company s policy to accept sales returns from its customers for products that have exceeded such dates 
the company s assumptions regarding sales return accruals are based on historical experience  current sales trends and other factors  and there has not been a significant fluctuation between assumptions and actual return activity on a historical basis 
actual sales returns represented approximately percent  percent and percent of annual moist smokeless tobacco can gross management s discussion and analysis continued sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in returned goods as a percentage of gross sales over the past three years was predominantly due to the growth of new products  including line extensions  which tend to have higher levels of returns than well established  core brands 
significant changes in moist smokeless tobacco can sales  promotional activities  new product introductions  product quality issues and competition could affect sales returns in the future 
accrued sales returns at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
the company is subject to various threatened and pending litigation claims and discloses those matters in which the probability of an adverse outcome is other than remote  in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
the assessment of probability with regards to the outcome of litigation matters is made with the consultation of external counsel 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against the company 
an unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
see the contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the company s assessment related to pending litigation matters 
the company s income tax provision takes into consideration pretax income  statutory tax rates and the company s tax profile in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities reflect its best estimate of the future tax benefit and costs it expects to realize when such amounts are included in its tax returns 
quantitative and probability analysis  which incorporates management s judgment  is required in determining the company s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
notwithstanding the fact that all of the company s tax filing positions are supported by the requisite tax and legal authority  accruals are established in accordance with sfas no 
 contingencies  when the company believes that these positions are likely to be subject to challenge by a tax authority 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audit the company s income tax returns on a continuous basis 
depending on the tax jurisdiction  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established an accrual is audited and ultimately resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the timing of tax audits and their final outcome  the company believes that its accruals reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the final resolution of any such tax audits could result in either a reduction in the company s accruals or an increase in its income tax provision  both of which could have a significant impact on the results of operations in any given period 
the company continually and regularly evaluates  assesses and adjusts these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  which could cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from period to period 
the company s management believes that no one item that includes an assumption or estimate made by management could have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  with the exception of litigation matters and income taxes  if actual results are different from that assumption or estimate 
the company exercises judgment when evaluating the use of assumptions and estimates  which may include the use of specialists and quantitative and qualitative analysis 
management believes that all assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable based on information currently available 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the disclosure and analysis in this report  as well as in other reports filed with or furnished to the sec or statements made by the company  may contain forward looking statements that describe the company s current expectations or forecasts of future events 
one can usually identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
forward looking statements often include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other similar words or terms in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these include statements relating to future actions  performance or results related to current or future products or product approvals  sales efforts  expenses  the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 
from time to time  the company may provide oral or written forward looking statements in other public materials 
k the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking information made on behalf of the company 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  which address activities or actions that the company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future  and growth of the company s operations and other such matters are forward looking statements 
to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the act  the company is identifying certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
any one  or a combination  of these factors could materially affect the results of the company s operations 
these risks and uncertainties include uncertainties associated with ongoing and future litigation relating to product liability  antitrust and other matters and legal and other regulatory initiatives  federal and state legislation  including actual and potential excise tax increases  and marketing restrictions relating to matters such as adult sampling  minimum age of purchase  self service displays and flavors  competition from other companies  including any new entrants into the marketplace  wholesaler ordering patterns  consumer preferences  including those relating to premium and price value brands and receptiveness to new product introductions and marketing and other promotional programs  the cost of tobacco leaf and other raw materials  conditions in capital markets  and other factors described in the company s annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k to the securities and exchange commission sec

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
the company routinely monitors this risk  and has instituted policies and procedures to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on its net earnings and cash flows 
to manage borrowing costs  the company uses fixed rate debt and derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps and treasury locks 
all derivative contracts are for non trading purposes  and are entered into with major reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing counterparty risk 
at december  and  the company had million and billion  respectively  in fixed rate senior notes and million in floating rate senior notes outstanding 
the fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  were comprised of long term notes of million with an interest rate of percent and million at percent 
the balance included these two issues plus senior notes of million with an interest rate of percent  which were designated as current on the december  consolidated statement of financial position 
these million senior notes were paid  upon maturity  in march in order to hedge the interest rate risk on the million floating rate senior notes  the company entered into an interest rate swap to pay a fixed rate of interest percent and receive a floating rate of interest on the notional amount of million 
this swap fixes the interest rate on the million in long term floating rate senior notes at percent 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate senior notes at december  was million  reflecting the application of current interest rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 
this fair value is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in the applicable market interest rates 
the following management s discussion and analysis continued provides a sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk and the effects of hypothetical sudden changes in the applicable market conditions on this fair value  based upon year end positions 
computations of the potential effects of the hypothetical market changes are based upon various assumptions  involving interest rate changes  keeping all other variables constant 
based upon an immediate basis point increase in the applicable interest rate at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate senior notes would decrease by approximately million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in that rate would increase the fair value of these notes by million 
these hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually takes place in the future  and the computations do not take into account management s possible actions if such changes actually occurred over time 
considering these limitations  actual effects on future earnings could differ from those calculated above 
taking into account the company s floating rate senior notes payable and interest rate swap outstanding at december   each basis point increase or decrease in the applicable market rates of interest  with all other variables held constant  would not have any effect on interest expense 
this is due to the full correlation of the terms of the notes with those of the swap  which results in interest rates on all debt outstanding being fixed at december  foreign currency risk the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts  designated as cash flow hedges  in order to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows associated with foreign currency payments required in connection with forecasted transactions to purchase oak barrels for its wine operations and firm commitments to purchase certain equipment for its tobacco operations 
there were several foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december   from which the net accumulated derivative loss  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  was immaterial 
concentration of credit risk the company routinely invests portions of its cash in short term instruments deemed to be cash equivalents 
it is the company s policy to ensure that these instruments are comprised of only investment grade securities as determined by a third party rating agency which mature in three months or less 
these factors  along with continual monitoring of the credit status of the issuer companies and securities  reduce the company s exposure to investment risk associated with these securities 
at december   the company had approximately million invested in these instruments 
short term investments at december  of million were comprised of ars  which are long term variable floating rate bonds that are tied to short term interest rates 
the stated maturities for these securities are generally to years  but their floating interest rates are reset at seven  or day intervals via a dutch auction process 
given the fact that ars are floating rate investments  they are typically traded at par value  with interest paid at each auction 
commodity price risk the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations in the form of contractual commitments to purchase leaf tobacco for use in manufacturing smokeless tobacco products and grapes and bulk wine for use in producing wine
