other accounting policies also have a significant effect on first advantage s consolidated financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
although first advantage believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ

allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all probable uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by management to arrive at an estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may ultimately be uncollectible 
in circumstances where first advantage is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  first advantage records a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected

the costs are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is established until the information is ready for use 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets first advantage carries intangible and long lived assets at cost less accumulated amortization where applicable 
accounting standards require that assets be written down if they become impaired 
intangible and long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
at such time that an impairment in value of an intangible or long lived asset is identified  the impairment will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by employing an expected present value technique  which utilizes multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect the range of possible outcomes and an appropriate discount rate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company completed a goodwill impairment test  for the year ending december   for all reporting units 
a valuation date of september  was used for this impairment test and was performed by management 
the test determined that each reporting unit had a fair value in excess of carrying value  therefore  no goodwill impairment was recorded 
purchase accounting first advantage completed fifteen acquisitions in  fourteen acquisitions in  and nine acquisitions in the purchase method of accounting requires companies to assign values to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their fair values 
in most instances  there is not a readily defined or listed market price for individual assets and liabilities acquired in connection with a business  including intangible assets 
the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities in many instances requires a high degree of estimation 
the valuation of intangibles assets  in particular  is very subjective 
first advantage generally uses internal cash flow models and  in certain instances  third party valuations in estimating fair values 
the use of different valuation techniques and assumptions can change the amounts and useful lives assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets and related amortization expense 
amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities as of december  are based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised in the company does not anticipate that revisions to the amounts allocated to acquired assets and liabilities  if any  will be significant to the company s financial statements

r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions
