item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  and the other financial information included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in part  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview for the year ended december   we experienced significant changes in our business as we implemented cost containment and restructuring actions in response to the loss of applied materials as a major customer in the fourth quarter of we transitioned from net sales of million for the fourth quarter of to average net sales of million for each fiscal quarter in in order to reduce our cost structure in response to lower net sales in  we incurred restructuring costs of million 
we incurred a net loss of million for  however  the cumulative benefits from the cost containment and restructuring actions taken during the year resulted in sequential quarterly improvements from a net loss of million for the first quarter of to net income of million for the fourth quarter of our gross profit increased million from million for the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of similarly  our operating income loss improved million from a loss of million for the first quarter of to operating income of million for the fourth quarter of during  we generated operating cash flow of million that was primarily applied to reduce our bank debt by million 
although our borrowing availability increased by million in  our revolving credit agreement provided for continuing reductions in borrowing advance rates that prompted us to begin a search in to identify a new lender 
during  we also sold certain non strategic assets that resulted in net cash proceeds of million and we listed additional assets for sale in an effort to reduce debt and improve our plant capacity utilization 
during the first quarter of  we completed the following actions that resulted in a significant reduction in our existing debt on march   we sold a building and land in sugar land  texas  which generated net proceeds of approximately million that we used to repay outstanding debt 
we leased back approximately of the building under a seven year lease to continue our manufacturing operations at that location 
in addition to the expected benefit from eliminating future interest cost due to the repayment of debt  we also expect to eliminate fixed overhead costs for real estate taxes  insurance and utilities related to the portion of the building that was not leased back 
on march   we entered into a million subordinated note purchase agreement with an affiliate of our majority stockholder 
in addition  the affiliate agreed to make additional subordinated loans up to million if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our new credit facility 
the outstanding principal balance plus all accrued interest is due in may on march   we entered into a new three year credit facility with us bank that permits borrowings up to million and matures in march as of march   the principal balance was approximately million  and we had unused borrowing availability of approximately million 
we believe the financing actions taken in the first quarter of will provide adequate liquidity to carry out our planned activities for the next year

table of contents information about our business suntron delivers complete manufacturing services and solutions to support the entire life cycle of complex products in the aerospace and defense  industrial  semiconductor capital equipment  networking and telecommunications  and medical equipment market sectors of the ems industry 
we provide design and engineering services  quick turn prototype  materials management  printed circuit board assembly and testing  electronic interconnect assemblies  subassemblies  and full systems integration known as box build  after market repair and warranty services 
we believe our competitive niche low volume  high mix and complex system integration is a direct result of our ability to provide unique solutions tailored to match each of our customer s specific requirements  while meeting the highest quality standards in the industry 
our largest single expenditure is for the purchase of electronic components and our expertise in electronics manufacturing techniques is critical to our ability to provide competitive  quality services 
however  in order to fully comprehend our business  it is also important to understand that our customers are engaged in aerospace and defense  industrial  semiconductor capital equipment  networking and telecommunications  medical equipment products  and many other industries 
while our ability to compete with other companies in the ems industry is important to our long term success  short term fluctuations in the demand for our manufacturing services are primarily affected by the economic conditions in the end market sectors served by our customers 
since more than half of our customers are currently concentrated in three market sectors aerospace and defense  industrial  and semiconductor capital equipment  the quarterly fluctuations in our net sales can be extremely volatile when these sectors are experiencing either rapid growth or contraction 
many of our customers are oems that have designed their own products 
our customers request proposals that include key terms such as quality  delivery  and the price to purchase the materials and perform the manufacturing services to make one or more components or assemblies 
generally  the component or assembly that we manufacture is delivered to the customer where it is then integrated into their final product 
we determine prices for new business with our customers by obtaining raw material quotes from our suppliers and then estimating the amount of labor and overhead that will be required to make the products 
before we begin a customer relationship  we typically enter into arrangements that are intended to protect us in case a customer cancels an order after we purchase the raw materials to fill that order 
in these circumstances  the customer is generally required to purchase the materials or reimburse us if we incur a loss from liquidating the raw materials 
the ems industry is extremely dynamic and our customers make frequent changes to their orders 
the magnitude and frequency of these changes make it difficult to predict revenues beyond the next quarter  and even relatively short term forecasts may prove inaccurate depending on changes in economic  political  and military factors  as well as unexpected customer requests to delay shipments near the end of our fiscal quarters 
these changes in customer orders also cause substantial difficulties in managing inventories  which often leads to excess inventories and the need to recognize losses on inventories 
however  from time to time  we may also have difficulties obtaining certain electronic components that are in short supply 
in addition  our inventories consist of over  different parts and many of these parts have limited alternative uses or markets beyond the products that we manufacture for our customers 
when we liquidate excess materials through an inventory broker or auction  we often realize less than the original cost of the materials  and in some cases we determine that there is no market for the excess materials 
the most common reasons we incur losses related to inventories are due to purchasing more materials than are necessary to meet a customer s requirements or failing to act promptly to minimize losses once the customer communicates a cancellation 
occasionally  it is not clear what action caused an inventory loss and there is a shared responsibility whereby our customers agree to negotiate a settlement with us 
in some cases  our customers may deny responsibility for excess inventories despite the existence of persuasive evidence that the customer was at fault  in these cases we must weigh all alternatives to resolve the dispute  including the possibility of litigation or arbitration 
accordingly  management continually evaluates inventory on hand  forecasted demand  contractual protections  and net realizable values in order to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying amount of inventory is necessary 
when the relationship with a customer terminates  we tend to be more vulnerable to inventory losses because the customer may be reluctant to accept responsibility for the remaining inventory if a product is at the end of its life cycle 
we can also incur inventory losses if a customer becomes insolvent and the materials do not have alternative uses or markets into which we can sell them 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and the related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring related obligations  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from manufacturing services and product sales upon shipment and transfer of title of the manufactured product  whereby our customers assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
occasionally  we enter into arrangements where services are bundled and completed in multiple stages 
in these cases  we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine the amount of revenue allocable to each deliverable 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services after shipment  however  if such requirements or obligations exist  then revenue is recognized at the point when the requirements are completed and the obligations fulfilled 
if uncertainties exist about whether the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership or if continuing performance obligations exist  we expand our written communications with the customer to ensure that our understanding of the arrangement is consistent with that of the customer before revenue is recognized 
in limited circumstances  our customers agree to purchase products but they request that we store the physical product in our facilities 
in these circumstances  revenue is only recognized when the terms of the arrangement comply with the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue from design  engineering  and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
write downs for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
our judgments about excess and obsolete inventories are especially difficult because i hundreds of different components may be associated with a single product we manufacture for a customer  ii we make numerous products for most of our customers  iii our customers are engaged in diverse industries  iv a significant amount of the parts we purchase are unique to a particular customer s orders and there are limited alternative markets if that customer s order is canceled  and v our customers experience dynamic business environments affected by a wide variety of economic  political  and regulatory factors 
this complex environment results in positive and negative events that can change daily and which affect judgments about future demand for our manufacturing services and the amounts we can realize when it is not possible to liquidate inventories through production of finished products 
we frequently review customer demand to determine if we have excess raw materials that will not be consumed in production 
in determining demand we consider firm purchase orders and forecasts of demand submitted by our customers 
if we determine that excess inventories exist and that the customer is not contractually obligated for the excess inventories  we make judgments about whether unforecasted demand for those materials is likely to occur or the amount we would likely realize in the sale of this material through a broker or auction 
if we determine that future demand from the customer is unlikely  we write down our inventories to the extent that the cost of the inventory exceeds the estimated market value 
if we record a write down to reduce the cost of inventories to market  such write down is not subsequently reversed 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in future periods 
likewise  if we underestimate contractual recoveries from customers or future demand  recognition of additional gross profit may be reported as the related goods are sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or the outcome of customer negotiations with respect to the enforcement of contractual provisions could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  as well as to provide for adjustments related to pricing and quantity differences 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
when our customers experience difficulty in paying us  we estimate how much of our receivable will not be collected 
these judgments are often difficult because the customer may not divulge complete and accurate information 
even if we are fully aware of the customer s financial condition it can be difficult to estimate the expected recovery and there is often a wide range of potential outcomes 
sometimes we collect receivables that we reserved for in prior periods and these recoveries are reflected as a credit to operations in the periods in which the recovery occurs 
over the past few years  we have diversified our concentration of business with our major customers and have added smaller customers that generally have higher credit risk 
accordingly  we may experience higher bad debt losses in the future 
restructuring activities and asset impairments 
when we undertake restructuring activities and decide to close a plant that we occupy under a non cancelable operating lease  we are required to estimate how long it will take to locate a new tenant to sublease the facility and to estimate the rate that we are likely to receive when a tenant is located 
accordingly  we will incur additional lease exit charges in future periods if our estimates of the rate or timing of sublease payments turns out to be less favorable than our current expectations 
we also consider the estimated cost of building improvements  brokerage commissions  and any other costs we believe will be incurred in connection with the subleasing process 
the precise outcome of most of these factors is difficult to predict 
we review our estimates at least quarterly  including consultation with our commercial real estate advisors to assess changes in market conditions  feedback from parties that have expressed interest  and other information that we believe is relevant to most accurately reflect the expected outcome of obtaining a subtenant to lease the facility 
commercial real estate conditions are currently weak in the area in which we are attempting to sublease a closed facility  and we believe our estimates have appropriately considered these conditions 
when we undergo changes in our business  including the closure or relocation of facilities  we often have equipment and other long lived assets that are no longer needed in continuing operations 
when this occurs  we are required to estimate future cash flows and if such undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets or asset group  as applicable  we recognize impairment charges to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows and fair value tend to be highly subjective estimates 
when assets are held for sale and the actual market conditions deteriorate  or are less favorable than those projected by management  additional impairment charges may be required in subsequent periods 
contingencies 
we are subject to loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies often involve legal proceedings where the outcome is not determinable with precision until all of the facts surrounding the dispute are known to both parties and legal counsel has had the opportunity to evaluate the merits of the case 
an estimated loss from contingencies such as a legal proceedings and claims brought against us is required to be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
revisions in estimates related to the potential outcome of loss contingencies could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
from time to time  we are also subject to gain contingencies in the ordinary course of our business 
generally  it is not appropriate to record the expected outcome of a gain contingency in our financial statements until it is realized in cash 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview of statement of operations net sales are recognized when title is transferred to our customers  which generally occurs upon shipment from our facilities 
net sales from design  engineering  and other services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
our sales are recorded net of customer discounts and credits taken or expected to be taken 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture of our products 
cost of goods sold also includes charges and credits related to manufacturing operations for lease exit costs  severance and retention costs  impairment of long lived assets  and obsolete and slow moving inventories 
many factors affect our gross profit  including fixed costs associated with plant and equipment capacity utilization  manufacturing efficiencies  changes in product mix  and production volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and external sales representatives and marketing costs  insurance expense  depreciation expense related to assets not used in manufacturing activities  bad debt charges and recoveries  professional fees for auditing and legal assistance  and general corporate expenses 
severance  retention  and lease exit costs primarily relate to costs associated with the closure of administrative facilities and reductions in our administrative workforce

related party management and consulting fees consist of fees paid to affiliates of our majority stockholder 
the services provided under these arrangements consist of management fees related to corporate development activities and consulting services for strategic and operational matters interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and other debt obligations 
interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees that are charged for the portion of our credit facility that is not used from time to time 
gain loss on sale of assets results from the sale of property  plant  and equipment for net proceeds that are more less than the net carrying value of such assets 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by several factors  primarily the level and timing of customer orders especially orders from our major customers 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy  and variation in demand for its products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions 
in the past  changes in orders from customers have had a significant effect on our results of operations 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december    and net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative expenses severance  retention  and lease exit costs related party management and consulting fees operating loss 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  from million for to million for the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in our net sales to applied materials  formerly a major customer engaged in the semiconductor capital equipment market sector 
the decrease in net sales for was also due to a million reduction in net sales to customers in the industrial market sector 
net sales for and include approximately million and million  respectively  of excess inventories that were sold back to customers pursuant to provisions of our customer agreements

for  honeywell accounted for of our net sales 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million for  a decrease of million from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the decrease in gross profit in was primarily attributable to the reduction in net sales discussed above combined with our inability to reduce fixed overhead costs in proportion to the decline in net sales 
however  we eliminated fixed overhead costs throughout which contributed to an improvement in our gross profit percentage from for the first quarter of to for the fourth quarter of in response to lower sales forecasts compared to the prior year  management took significant restructuring and cost cutting actions in to reduce operating costs 
in  we incurred restructuring costs of million  consisting of million for severance costs related to reductions in the manufacturing workforce and the termination of an executive officer  and million for lease exit costs associated with the early termination of our austin warehouse lease 
this warehouse was dedicated to our business with applied materials and was no longer necessary to support operations after our business relationship terminated 
for  restructuring costs related to our manufacturing activities were million 
during a significant amount of equipment became fully depreciated  although many of these assets are still in service 
accordingly  depreciation expense related to manufacturing activities declined by approximately million in compared to inventory write downs increased million from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the increase in inventory write downs in was attributable to several unrelated factors including the renegotiation of a major customer agreement that increases our responsibility for excess and obsolete inventories in exchange for higher selling prices  and higher excess inventory losses related to customers that are either experiencing financial difficulties or have terminated our business relationship 
in both and  write downs of excess inventories are related to a variety of customers for which we do not expect to realize the carrying value through production or other means of liquidation 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a were million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in the decrease in sg a was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries and benefits of million  partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of million and an increase in legal and professional fees of million  primarily related to our lawsuit against applied materials

in  we also incurred severance costs of approximately million  primarily due to the termination of executive officers 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in interest expense in was primarily attributable to higher interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings 
our weighted average borrowings decreased from million for to million for our weighted average interest rate increased from for to for gain loss on sale of assets 
during  we recognized a gain on sale of assets of million  primarily related to the sale of a acre parcel of land and certain equipment used for plastic injection molding and sheet metal fabrication 
the acre parcel of land was sold for million and a million gain was recognized 
the plastic injection molding equipment was sold for million and resulted in a gain on the sale of million  and the sheet metal fabrication equipment was sold for million and resulted in a gain on the sale of million 
unrealized loss on marketable securities 
during the third quarter of  a former customer emerged from bankruptcy protection and we received marketable equity securities that were traded on the nasdaq smallcap market in exchange for our fully reserved receivable 
these securities were classified as trading securities which results in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses in our statements of operations 
the trading value of these securities declined from million when the bankruptcy plan was confirmed in july to million by the end of  which resulted in an unrealized loss of million for in march  we sold these securities and recorded cash proceeds of million and an additional unrealized loss of million 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in our net sales to customers engaged in the semiconductor capital equipment market sector  an increase of million for customers in the industrial market sector  and an increase of million for customers in the aerospace and defense market sector 
net sales for and include approximately million and million  respectively  of excess inventories that were sold back to customers pursuant to contractual provisions of our customer agreements 
for  net sales also include the recovery of unauthorized customer discounts of approximately million 
for  honeywell and applied materials accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
for  honeywell and applied materials accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
gross profit loss 
our gross profit improved by million from a loss of million for to a profit of million for similarly  gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved from a loss of for to a profit of for the improvement in gross profit for is primarily attributable to the significant increase in net sales while fixed manufacturing overhead costs remained relatively unchanged 
in  we incurred restructuring costs related to manufacturing activities of million  including million of accelerated depreciation due to shortened lives of leasehold improvements  million for lease exit costs primarily associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in phoenix  and million for severance costs related to terminated employees 
in november  we entered into an agreement with the landlord of our leased facility in fremont  california  whereby we paid million as consideration for the early termination of the lease 
we incurred additional costs of million related to the fremont lease in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a credit of million due to the extinguishment of the remaining liability 
this credit was reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold since the loss relating to future lease exit costs of the vacated facility that was accrued in was charged to cost of goods sold 
in  we incurred restructuring costs related to our manufacturing activities of million 
during a significant amount of manufacturing equipment became fully depreciated  although many of these assets are still in service 
accordingly  depreciation expense for declined by approximately million compared to 
table of contents inventory write downs increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for in and  write downs of excess inventories are related to a variety of customers for which we do not expect to realize the carrying value through production or other means of liquidation 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  from million for to million for the increase in sg a during was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation and benefits of million  an increase in professional fees of million  offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of million  and a decrease in facilities related costs of million

we also incurred severance costs  primarily related to executive level management changes  of approximately million for during  we incurred total severance  retention and lease exit costs related to administrative activities of million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings 
our weighted average borrowings increased from million for to million for the impact of higher borrowings was partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average interest rate from in to in unrealized loss on marketable equity securities 
during the third quarter of  a former customer emerged from bankruptcy protection and we received marketable equity securities that were traded on the nasdaq smallcap market in exchange for our fully reserved receivable 
the trading value of these securities declined from million when the bankruptcy plan was confirmed to million by the end of  which resulted in an unrealized loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  an improvement of million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the difference between our net loss of million in and million of positive operating cash flow was primarily attributable to a decrease in inventories of million  million of depreciation and amortization expense  and an increase in accounts payable of million 
inventories decreased in primarily due to lower working capital requirements associated with a significant decrease in our net sales 
during  operating activities used million of cash  primarily due to higher inventories and receivables that were required to support the significant increase in net sales that occurred in during and  we accepted some orders from smaller  less creditworthy customers 
while losses due to credit risk have not been a significant factor in the past  this trend may not continue in the future as we continue to diversify our major customer concentration with orders from smaller customers 
if delinquencies related to our receivables increase in the future  this could adversely affect our borrowing capacity because accounts that are aged more than days from the invoice date are ineligible in the borrowing base calculation under our credit agreement 
days sales outstanding based on net sales for the year and net trade receivables outstanding at the end of the year increased to days for  compared to days for days sales outstanding were lower in primarily because applied materials was a major customer that took advantage of accelerated payment terms in inventories decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  for  inventory turns cost of goods sold excluding restructuring charges of million for and million for  divided by year end inventories amounted to times per year compared to times per year for the termination of our business relationship with applied materials was primarily 
table of contents responsible for the decrease in inventory turns for  since we had insignificant sales to this customer during and we have approximately million of gross inventories that are subject to litigation 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in investing cash flows for totaled million of cash outflows  consisting of the payment of million of contingent consideration related to the earn out associated with the acquisition of trilogic systems and payments totaling million  primarily for manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements for our new facility in mexico 
our cash outflows for investing activities were offset by million of proceeds consisting primarily of million from the sale of a acre parcel of land  million from the sale of equipment used for plastic injection molding and sheet metal fabrication  and million from the sale leaseback of certain manufacturing equipment 
investing cash flows for consist of the payment of million of contingent consideration for the earn out associated with the acquisition of trilogic systems  million for the acquisition of a business  and million for other capital expenditures 
our cash outflows for investing activities were partially offset by million of cash proceeds from the sale of real estate in ottawa  kansas that we exited in cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for was million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million for financing cash flows for reflect the net repayment of debt of million  payment of million of debt issuance costs associated with amendments to our revolving credit agreement  and a decrease in outstanding checks in excess of cash balances of million 
financing cash flows for reflect net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of million 
during  an increase in outstanding checks in excess of cash balances of million contributed positively to cash flows from financing activities 
during  we also paid debt issuance costs of million related to our revolving credit agreement 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  revolving operating purchase credit leases obligations other total dollars in table are in millions year ending december after our revolving credit agreement expires in july but all borrowings are classified as current liabilities due to the lenders requirement for a lockbox arrangement 
effective march   we terminated this credit agreement and obtained a new credit facility with us bank which has a similar lockbox arrangement but expires in march includes an aggregate of million  which has been included in the determination of our liability for lease exit costs that is recorded on our balance sheet at december  us generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for future lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for facilities that we have closed 

table of contents consists of obligations under outstanding purchase orders 
approximately of the deliveries under outstanding purchase orders are expected to be received in the first quarter of we often have the ability to cancel these obligations if we provide sufficient notice to our suppliers 
consists of million payable under agreements for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment 
capital resources 
our working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase in working capital during was primarily attributable to the reclassification of assets held for sale of million 
at december   the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility would have supported borrowings up to million  and we had outstanding borrowings of million and an outstanding letter of credit for million under this credit facility 
accordingly  as of december   we had unused availability of million after deducting outstanding borrowings and the letter of credit 
the borrowing base calculation under our credit facility is based on a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories  plus the appraised value of certain real estate and equipment 
accordingly  our borrowing availability generally decreases as our net receivables and inventories decline 
the credit agreement also limits or prohibits us from paying dividends  selling significant assets  acquiring other businesses  or merging with other entities without the consent of the lenders 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings 
the credit agreement also includes a lockbox arrangement that requires the company to instruct our customers to remit payments to restricted cash accounts  whereby all available funds are immediately used to pay down the outstanding principal balance 
accordingly  the entire outstanding principal balance is classified as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
on july   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date until july  and included less stringent covenants for ebitda for prior to july   the applicable margin the premium we are charged in excess of published base and libor rates under the credit agreement was for base rate borrowings and for libor rate borrowings 
under the amended credit agreement  the applicable margin was reduced to for base rate borrowings and for libor rate borrowings 
in order to ensure the continuing availability of funding under our credit facility  we were required to comply with a covenant for earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda discussed below 
when the aggregate value of assets included in the borrowing base does not exceed outstanding borrowings by at least million  the amended credit agreement provided that a more stringent ebitda covenant must be complied with  and the more stringent covenant has been in effect since january we would have violated this more stringent ebitda covenant by the end of the first quarter of but  effective march   the lenders agreed to amend the ebitda covenant for the remainder of the year ending december  we complied with the amended ebitda covenant for each of our fiscal months in in connection with the march  amendment  the applicable margin for base rate borrowings increased by on march   with subsequent quarterly increases of on july   october  and january  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings increased by on march   with subsequent quarterly increases of on july   october  and january  in addition  we were obligated to pay a commitment fee of per annum of the unused portion of the credit facility 
on august   our lenders agreed to amend the credit agreement to permit an affiliate of our largest stockholder to enter into a participation agreement with the lenders 
under the participation agreement  the affiliate purchased a million interest in the credit facility and the lenders agreed to pay interest to the affiliate at the same rate that the lenders charge the company under the amended credit agreement 
this million participation is subordinated to the lenders rights under the amended credit agreement 
as consideration for the participation of our affiliate  the lenders agreed to increase our borrowing availability by million and to provide a more favorable customer concentration limit for receivables from a certain customer through the lenders are required to return the million participation payment to our affiliate if we are successful in raising additional subordinated debt or equity proceeds in excess of million 
the lenders can elect to prepay the million participation obligation starting january  effective january   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that provides for a more favorable customer concentration limit for receivables from a significant customer and also delays certain scheduled reductions in advance rates for real estate and equipment from january  until may  additionally  the affiliate of our largest stockholder agreed to amend the participation 
table of contents agreement to provide an additional million to the lenders on january  in exchange for an immediate increase in our borrowing availability of million 
during  and  we exercised our rights to require our customers including applied materials to purchase excess inventories totaling million  million and million  respectively  under relevant provisions of our customer agreements 
applied materials was a customer of suntron and its predecessors for over ten years 
during the past two years we intensified our efforts to recover costs incurred for excess and obsolete inventories 
in october  applied materials notified us that it intended to transition substantially all of its business to alternative contract manufacturers and by january our business relationship with applied materials had substantially terminated 
in december  we initiated litigation in fort bend county  texas  seeking monetary damages against applied materials for expenses relating to raw materials  inventory  and capital and human resources that we expended in reliance upon applied materials representations  in addition to other business losses 
on january   applied materials filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the superior court of the state of california 
applied materials complaint seeks to establish that the dispute should be resolved in california and that it is not liable for suntron s inventory costs 
applied materials seeks recovery of its attorneys fees but is not seeking any other claim for monetary damages 
the california litigation has been stayed indefinitely  pending resolution of the texas litigation 
our dispute involves a potential loss contingency if the outcome of the litigation does not result in a settlement that is adequate to recover the net carrying value of our inventories 
similar to the process employed for all of our customers  we evaluated excess inventories for applied materials on a quarterly basis and write downs were recognized in the period when we determined that recovery was not appropriate based on the applicable written agreements 
we believe that applied materials is responsible for the net carrying value of inventories that we purchased on its behalf and we intend to vigorously prosecute all of our claims 
no assurances can be made as to the final timing or outcome of the litigation 
in connection with this litigation  we currently expect to incur attorneys fees and related costs of up to million during we continue to evaluate sales forecasts in relation to our operations  and many restructuring actions were taken in and to position us for improved operating results in in the second and third quarters of  we achieved profitable operations for the first time since suntron was formed in the first quarter of in response to lower sales for compared to  we took significant restructuring and cost cutting actions in we incurred million in restructuring expense  of which million is included in cost of goods sold and million is included in operating expenses 
this restructuring expense was necessary to adjust our cost structure to a level where profitability may be attained in future periods 
despite our net loss of million for  our quarterly results showed significant improvement from a net loss of million for the first quarter of to net income of million for the fourth quarter of during  we also generated operating cash flow of million and our borrowing availability increased from million at december  to million as of december  although our borrowing availability increased by million in  our revolving credit agreement provided for continuing reductions in borrowing advance rates that prompted us to begin a search in to identify a new lender 
during  we also sold certain non strategic assets that resulted in net cash proceeds of million and we listed additional assets for sale in an effort to reduce debt and improve our plant capacity utilization 
during the first quarter of  we completed the following actions that resulted in a significant reduction in our existing debt on march   we sold a building and land in sugar land  texas  which generated net proceeds of approximately million that we used to repay outstanding debt 
we leased back approximately of the building under a seven year lease to continue our manufacturing operations at that location 
in addition to the expected benefit from eliminating future interest cost due to the repayment of debt  we also expect to eliminate fixed overhead costs for real estate taxes  insurance and utilities related to the portion of the building that was not leased back 
on march   we entered into a million subordinated note purchase agreement with an affiliate of our majority stockholder 
in addition  the affiliate agreed to make additional subordinated loans up to million if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our new credit facility 
the outstanding principal balance plus all accrued interest is due in may on march   we entered into a new three year credit facility with us bank that permits borrowings up to million and matures in march as of march   the principal balance under our us bank credit agreement was approximately million  and we have unused borrowing availability of approximately million 

table of contents we believe the financing actions taken in the first quarter of will provide adequate liquidity to carry out our planned activities for the next year 
ebitda financial covenant under previous credit agreement 
the primary measure of our operating performance is net income loss 
however  our lenders and many investment analysts believe that other measures of operating performance are relevant 
one of these alternative measures is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
management emphasizes that ebitda is a non gaap measurement that excludes many significant items that are also important to understanding and assessing suntron s financial performance 
additionally  in evaluating alternative measures of operating performance  it is important to understand that there are no standards for these calculations 
accordingly  the lack of standards can result in subjective determinations by management about which items may be excluded from the calculations  as well as the potential for inconsistencies between different companies that have similarly titled alternative measures 
in order to illustrate our ebitda calculations  we have provided the details below of the calculations for the years ended december  and using a traditional definition  as well as the calculation pursuant to the definition in our previous revolving credit agreement 
our lenders modified the traditional definition of ebitda to exclude certain operating charges that may be considered unlikely to recur in the future or that may be excluded due to a variety of other reasons 
as shown below  the measure of ebitda under a traditional definition differs materially from the calculation of ebitda under our previous credit agreement dollars in millions net loss income tax expense interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda per traditional definition restructuring costs a other charges b ebitda per credit agreement definition a restructuring costs include lease exit costs  impairment of long lived assets  and severance  retention  and moving costs related to facility closures and other reductions in workforce 
for  approximately million of restructuring costs were incurred but are not included in the calculation above since they exceeded the amount permitted under the credit agreement 
b includes stock based compensation expense  net gains from disposition of capital assets  and charges related to outstanding litigation related to termination of our business relationship with applied materials 
due to a reduction in borrowing availability  a more stringent ebitda covenant first became effective in january we would have violated this more stringent ebitda covenant by the end of the first quarter of however  effective march   the lenders agreed to amend the ebitda covenant for the remainder of the year ended december  we complied with the amended ebitda covenant for each of our fiscal months for the year ended december  effective march   we terminated this credit facility and entered into a new revolving credit agreement with us bank  na 
table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards inventory cost 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no  chapter this statement requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will be required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
share based payment 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement no 
r establishes standards of accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this standard generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service usually the vesting period in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee stock options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  accordingly  we will adopt statement no 
r in the first quarter of we intend to use the modified prospective transition method when we adopt statement no 
r 
under the modified prospective method  we will be required to recognize compensation cost for share based awards to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied  as well as compensation cost for awards that were granted prior to  but not vested as of the date of adoption 
prior periods will not be restated and the pro forma disclosures continue to be required for periods prior to the adoption date 
we believe the impact of adopting this new standard on our future results of operations will require approximately million of incremental unvested compensation cost that will be recognized as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and approximately million that will be recognized after in addition to these amounts  we will also recognize additional compensation cost related to new stock options and other share based payments that are granted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had a revolving line of credit that provides for total borrowings up to million 
the interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate and libor rates  plus applicable margins 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  we may experience changes in interest expense that will impact financial results 
we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements  or similar instruments  to protect against the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
assuming outstanding borrowings of million  if interest rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  the result would be an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of million 
accordingly  significant increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations
