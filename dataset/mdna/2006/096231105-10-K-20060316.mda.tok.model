executive overview we operate through two business segments 
bluegreen resorts develops  markets and sells vois in our bluegreen vacation club resorts  and provides resort management services to resort property owners associations 
bluegreen communities acquires large tracts of real estate  which are subdivided  improved in some cases to include a golf course on the property and sold  typically on a retail basis  as homesites 
in connection with the securitization of certain of its receivables in december  the company undertook a review of the prior accounting treatment for certain of its existing and prior notes receivable purchase facilities together the purchase facilities 
as a result of that review  on december   the company determined that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal and the fiscal years ended december  and due to certain misapplications of gaap in the accounting for sales of the company s vacation ownership notes receivable and other related matters 
the following sections describe the restatement matters in more detail 
for a detailed discussion of the restatement see note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and net earnings 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  with the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings historically occurring in the quarters ending in june and september each year 
however  as a result of the required adoption of statement of position  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sop effective january   we anticipate that prospectively the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings will occur in the quarters ending in september and december each year  primarily due to the deferral and subsequent recognition of voi sales revenue see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of sop 
other material fluctuations in operating results may occur due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of income recognition  income is recognized as work progresses 
measures of progress are based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to expected total costs 
we expect that we will continue to invest in projects that will require substantial development with significant capital requirements  and hence that our results of operations may fluctuate significantly between quarterly and annual periods as a result of the required use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we do not believe that inflation and changing prices have historically had a material impact on our revenues and results of operations 
however  we continually review and have historically increased the sales prices of our vois periodically and construction costs have increased and are expected to increase 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
to the extent inflationary trends affect interest rates  a portion of our debt service costs may be adversely affected  including interest cost on our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities 
we recognize revenue on homesite and voi sales when  subject to applicable accounting rules  a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the refund or rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development of the real estate sold 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize income in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of vacation ownership resorts and residential communities  including carrying costs such as interest and taxes  are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of real estate sold as the respective revenues are recognized 
a portion of our revenues historically has been and is expected to continue to be comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the gains are recorded on our consolidated statement of income and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
the amount of gains recognized and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s best estimates of future prepayment  default rates  loss severity rates  discount rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans occur more quickly than we projected at the time such loans were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  interest would be less than expected and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to operations 
if actual defaults or other factors discussed above with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  charge offs would exceed previously estimated amounts and the cash flow from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would decrease 
also  to the extent the portfolio of receivables sold fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to  for example  an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or certain other events occur  the funds received from obligors must be distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow to us from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would be reduced until the outside investors are paid or the regular payment formula is resumed 
if these situations were to occur on a material basis  it could cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
there is no assurance that the carrying value of our retained interests in notes receivable sold will be fully realized or that future loan sales will be consummated or  if consummated  result in gains 
see vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements  below 
in addition  we have historically sold vacation ownership receivables to financial institutions through warehouse purchase facilities to monetize the receivables while accumulating enough receivables for a future term securitization transaction 
we currently intend to structure future warehouse purchase facilities so that sales of vacation ownership receivables through these facilities will be accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings rather than as off balance sheet sales 
therefore  we will not recognize a gain on the sales of receivables sold through the warehouse purchase facilities until such receivables are included in a properly structured term securitization transaction 
we expect this may impact future quarterly earnings patterns as compared to comparable prior periods 
we are spending a substantial amount of management time and resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestations as to the effectiveness of these systems by our independent registered public accounting firm 
we expect to continue to expend significant management time and resources documenting and testing our internal control systems and procedures 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be in a position to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable  below 
should our estimates regarding the collectibility of our receivables change adversely  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing of our bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  and thus our results of operations could be materially  adversely impacted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  the capitalized costs of our real estate projects are assigned to individual vois or homesites in the projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each voi or homesite 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
o allowance for loan losses 
we estimate credit losses on our notes receivable portfolios in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as our notes receivable portfolios consist of a large group of smaller balance  homogeneous loans 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  we first segment our notes receivable by identifying risk characteristics that are common to groups of loans and then estimate credit losses based on the risks associated with these segments 
we consider many factors when establishing and evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for loan losses 
these factors include recent and historical default rates  static pool analyses  current delinquency rates  contractual payment terms  loss severity rates along with present and expected economic conditions 
we review these factors and measure loan impairment by applying historical loss rates  adjusted for relevant environmental and collateral values  to the segments aggregate loan balances 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
should our estimates of these and other pertinent factors change  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity position could be materially  adversely affected 
o transfers of financial assets 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and related interpretations 
the evaluation of sale treatment under sfas no 
involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales in accordance with sfas no 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches  rights to excess interest spread and servicing rights  all of which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately  in the fair market value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization  based on higher than anticipated default rates in the portfolio sold 
o asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets including our real estate properties under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors that we consider in making this evaluation include the estimated remaining life of project sales for each project based on current retail prices and the estimated costs to complete each project 
should our estimates of these factors change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been assigned 
as of december   only our bluegreen resorts reporting unit had any recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
should our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not egreen bluegreen reflect the actual economic costs  sorts communities a contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted

corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see corporate general and administrative expenses  below  for further discussion 
sales and field operations 
consolidated sales were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
consolidated sales increased from to and from to bluegreen resorts 
during  and  sales of vois contributed million  million and million of our total consolidated sales  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
year ended december  december  december  number of voi sale transactions 
   average sales price per transaction    gross margin the million or increase in bluegreen resorts sales during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to same site sales increases at our various sales offices 
same site sales increases aggregated million and were highlighted by the increase in sales at the fountains sales office in orlando  florida million increase  our dallas  texas offsite sales office million increase  our harbour lights sales office in myrtle beach  south carolina million increase and our bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar sales office million increase 
we opened four new sales sites in  which generated an aggregate million in sales 
our new sales sites were our offsite sales office in king of prussia  pennsylvania opened march  our sales office at the suites at hershey resort opened june  our offsite sales office in atlanta  georgia opened november and our sales office at the daytona seabreeze resort opened december 
the overall sales increase was also due to our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased to approximately of resorts sales during as compared to of resorts sales in this  combined with an overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during and a slightly higher sale to tour conversion ratio during increasing to in from in significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to the million  or  increase in bluegreen resorts sales during as compared to  was due in part to the opening of five sales sites either after or just prior to december  grande villas at world golf village opened in november  the fountains in orlando  florida opened in december  an off site sales office in destin  florida opened in july  but closed prior to december   the hammocks at marathon resort sales office in marathon  florida opened august and an off site sales office in dallas  texas opened in october 
these new sales sites generated a combined million of incremental sales during the remainder of the sales increase was due to same store sales increases primarily as a result of greater focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased to approximately of resorts sales during as compared to of resorts sales during this  combined with an overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during at a consistent sale to tour conversion ratio of and during and  respectively  significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
during the year ended december   our gross margin was favorably impacted by the sale of relatively lower cost vois acquired through opportunistic acquisitions in approximately condominium units in which are selling vois were constructed and became available for sale at the beginning of at the fountains  which has a product cost of approximately of sales price 
we anticipate that our gross margin will remain within the historical range of to in  despite rising construction costs and expected increases in the cost of real estate for acquisition  due to an increase in the sales prices of our vois effected in january and continued benefit from sales of higher margin inventory  such as the fountains 
other resort operations revenues increased million or during as compared to the increase was due to higher fees earned by our wholly owned title company for providing title processing services on all of our voi sales  commensurate with the increase in resort sales 
other resort operations revenues increased million or during as compared to these increases were due to increases in revenues from our mini vacation sales and vacation ownership tour generation business  our vacation ownership resort interior purchasing and design business  title agency fees  and fees earned for providing reservation services for the bluegreen vacation club 
cost of other resort operations increased million or during as compared to the increase in the cost of other resort operations was due primarily to increases in the related revenues discussed above as well as due to higher subsidies paid to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies increased in the aggregate based on an increase in our voi inventory 
cost of other resort operations increased million  or  during as compared to these increases were due primarily to subsidies and maintenance fees paid to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies and fees increased in the aggregate due to the increase in the number of our resorts since december  and due to increased maintenance fees incurred on our remaining voi inventory at the la cabana beach and racquet club resort in aruba 
in addition  costs of other resort operations increased due to the opening and subsequent expansion of our owner contact center in indianapolis  indiana  which handles reservations and customer service for members of the bluegreen vacation club 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately during the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of start up marketing costs incurred at our new sales offices  partially offset by the favorable impact on selling and marketing cost of the increase in sales to existing owners during as compared to selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to the as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during this increase was primarily due to a decrease in the marketing efficiency of our off premises contact opc marketing programs 
opc marketing programs involve making contact with individuals at tourist and other high traffic locations in the vacation destinations in proximity to our resorts and soliciting them to take sales tours at one of our resort properties 
opc costs as a percentage of related sales increased to during from during  due to increased competition for opc locations and a decrease in the sale to tour conversion ratio for our opc tours 
we believe that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurances can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not continue to increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to the increase in field general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of the cost of operating our new sales offices 
field general and administrative expenses stayed consistent at approximately million during both and these costs as a percentage of sales decreased to for from during as of december  and  bluegreen resorts had no sales or field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
the adoption of a sop  effective january   will change our treatment of sales incentives and the conversion of our sampler packages to voi sales  both of which will result in the deferral of sales recognition of certain voi sales financed by the company 
we anticipate that all of our financed sales  other than sales to owners  will be required to be deferred for periods ranging from one to four months 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of sop bluegreen communities 
during  and  bluegreen communities generated million  million  and million  of our total consolidated sales  respectively 
the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and excluding sales of bulk parcels 
year ended december  december  december  number of homesites sold    average sales price per homesite    gross margin bluegreen communities sales increased  or less than during as compared to due primarily to the sell out of several communities during the primary reason for our slower growth in communities was traditions of braselton  a  acre golf course community in braselton  georgia  and brickshire  our golf course community located in new kent virginia was substantially sold out and higher sales were generated during the year 
partially offsetting these declines were higher sales at many of our other communities  including sanctuary cove at st 
andrews sound  an approximately acre golf course community in brunswick  georgia  and chapel ridge  our approximately acre golf course community in chatham county  north carolina 
during we commenced sales at sugar tree on the brazos  a community located outside fort worth  texas  saddle creek forest  a community located near houston  texas and the settlement at patriot ranch  our community located near san antonio  texas 
during we recognized aggregate sales at these three communities of million 
in we also acquired a property near san antonio which we are developing as havenwood at hunters crossing 
sales at havenwood at hunters crossing began in january in march  we acquired a  acre property near dallas  texas  which we believe will begin sales in the fourth quarter of as noted above  certain of our properties substantially sold out earlier in than previously anticipated as a result of the continued strong demand for our communities 
although there is no assurance that we will be successful  we are continually exploring the acquisition of properties in markets where we currently conduct business  and in new regions of the country  in order to maintain appropriate levels of properties in our portfolio 
bluegreen communities sales increased million or during as compared to in november  we acquired and commenced sales at our approximately acre golf course community in brunswick  georgia known as sanctuary cove at st 
andrews sound 
sanctuary cove recognized incremental sales of approximately million during as compared to  as this project had just opened for sales in december sanctuary cove had an additional million of sales deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting as of december  our brickshire golf course community  which is located in new kent  virginia  recognized million more sales during as compared to  due primarily to increased effectiveness of sales programs and price increases 
in march  bluegreen communities acquired  acres in braselton  georgia for the development of a new golf course community known as the traditions of braselton 
this project recognized approximately million more sales during as compared to  due primarily to the recognition of sales previously deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in july  we acquired and commenced sales at our approximately acre golf course community in chatham county  north carolina known as chapel ridge 
chapel ridge recognized sales of approximately million during  and had an additional million of sales deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting as of december  mountain springs ranch  our community in smithson valley  texas near san antonio  recognized million more sales during as compared to  as this project had just opened for sales in december the remaining sales increase was realized at several of our other existing communities  including the following communities in texas o ridgelake shores  located in magnolia  texas near houston  texas million increase in sales 
o quail springs ranch  located in peaster  texas near the dallas fort worth metroplex million increase in sales 
o mystic shores  located in spring branch  texas near san antonio million increase in sales 
bluegreen communities gross margin increased from in to in variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc 
will impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of the percentage of completion method of accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  although the annual gross margin has historically been between and of sales and is expected to approximate these percentages for the foreseeable future 
other communities operations include the operation of our golf courses as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
other communities operations revenues increased million or from million to million and the related costs increased million or from million to million during and  respectively 
this was primarily due to increased play at our traditions at braselton and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses located in georgia and north carolina  respectively 
we are currently constructing a new daily fee golf course in connection with the development of chapel ridge  which is expected to open in the fall of our golf course at sanctuary cove opened for play in february of other communities operations revenues increased  or from million to million and the related costs decreased  or from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased play at our brickshire and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses located in new kent  virginia and chapel hill  north carolina  respectively 
our golf course operations incurred aggregate losses of million   and  during  and  respectively 
the losses from golf course operations are due to fixed operating expenses  low  seasonal revenues during the winter months and high maintenance costs during periods when we are marketing homesites in the surrounding community 
also  certain of our golf courses are still in their early years of operations during the periods presented 
we believe that the operating results of these new courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located build their homes and begin living in the community  as this should increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be achieved 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased as a percentage of sales from to during and  respectively 
these expenditures decreased as a percentage of sales due to a higher average sales price per homesite coupled with relative advertising efficiencies at our new golf course communities in georgia as compared to our other projects 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased as a percentage of sales from to during the and  respectively  due to the advertising efficiencies realized at several of our bluegreen golf communities in brickshire  traditions of braselton  sanctuary cove and chapel ridge generated selling and marketing expenses of less than  collectively  as a percentage of sales due to the attractiveness of these golf course communities to consumers in the markets where these communities are located 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses remained constant from to and increased million  or  during as compared to this increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the fact that the costs associated with new communities that opened for sales were greater than the costs associated with communities which substantially sold out during the increase in these costs was also due to higher performance bonuses to bluegreen communities management  commensurate with the significant increase in the segment s field operating profit during as compared to as a percentage of sales  bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the and  respectively 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  resorts acquisition and development  mortgage servicing  treasury and legal 
such expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the million or increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to o the expansion of our corporate facilities  as well as increased personnel and other expenses in our information technology  resort acquisitions and development  and accounting departments to support our growth o increased accounting and auditing expenses of million  primarily incurred in connection with requirements associated with the sarbanes oxley act of o severance charges of approximately million associated with the departure of our former chief financial officer  these increases were partially off set by lower legal expenses and higher profits from our mortgage servicing operation realized during as compared to the million or increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to o an aggregate increase of million in personnel and other expenses incurred in our information technology  resort acquisitions development  human resources  corporate headquarters and mortgage areas to help support our growth  o increased legal expenses due to the million impact of the settlement of a sales tax dispute with the state of wisconsin and approximately million related to litigation settlements  one of which is subject to court approval  o increased accounting and auditing expenses of million  primarily incurred in connection with requirements associated with the sarbanes oxley act of  and o an increase in corporate health and other insurance expenses of million 
for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  please see sales and field operations  above 
interest income 
interest income is earned from our notes receivable  retained interests in notes receivable sold and cash and cash equivalents 
interest income was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income during was due to lower interest income earned from our notes receivable commensurate with a lower average aggregate notes receivable balance during the period as compared to in addition  we recognized an other than temporary decrease of  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold 
the increase in interest income during was due to higher interest income earned from our notes receivable commensurate with a higher average aggregate notes receivable balance during the period as compared to gain on sales of notes receivable 
during and  we recognized gains on the sale of notes receivable totaling million and million  respectively 
we sell a portion of our vacation ownership notes receivable pursuant to vacation ownership receivables securitization transactions or through vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities that qualify for sales treatment per sfas during  all sales of notes receivable were made to vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  none of which qualified for sales accounting treatment pursuant to sfas as such  there were no gains on sales of notes receivables during the amount of notes receivable sold during a period depends on several factors  including the amount of availability  if any  under receivables purchase facilities  the amount of eligible receivables available for sale  our cash requirements  the covenants and other provisions of the relevant vacation ownership receivables purchase facility as described further below and management s discretion 
the generally accepted accounting principles governing our sale of receivable transactions is evolving and achieving off balance sheet accounting treatment is becoming more difficult 
due to the complexity of the accounting rules surrounding such transactions  we have decided to limit the use of off balance sheet structures in the future 
in  we intend to structure our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities that are used to accumulate receivables pending a term securitization transaction in a manner so as to account for sales of receivables under such facilities as on balance sheet borrowings pursuant to sfas no gains will be recognized on the sales of receivables to such facilities until the receivables are included in an appropriately structured term securitization transaction 
this accounting treatment is expected to increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings prospectively  but is not anticipated to materially impact annual earnings 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense for as compared  was primarily a result of lower average debt outstanding and more interest being capitalized due to increased construction activity  partially off set by the impact of increased borrowing rates 
the increase in interest expense in as compared to the  was due to higher average outstanding debt balances  primarily related to increased receivable backed debt  which was paid off in july by a term securitization transaction 
our effective cost of borrowing was   and for  and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded provisions for loan losses totaling million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the and increases in the provision for loan losses during and  respectively  were primarily due to increases in bluegreen resorts sales  approximately of which were financed by us

changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for  and in thousands year ended december  december  december  cash flows provided by operating activities    cash flows used by investing activities    cash flows used by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities increased million or from net cash inflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
proceeds from the sale of and borrowings collateralized by notes receivable  net of payments on such borrowings  increased million from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the remainder of the increase in operating cash flows during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was commensurate with the decrease in inventory  as a result of our increased voi and homesite sales 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this decrease was due primarily to higher construction and development spending during as compared to additionally  during we acquired land for three bluegreen communities developments saddle creek forest  the settlement at patriot ranch  and havenwood at hunter s crossing and three vacation ownership resorts daytona seabreeze  seaglass towers  and carolina grande  as compared to the acquisition of only one vacation ownership resort the suites at hershey and only two communities sugar tree on the brazos and chapel ridge during these acquisition and related construction and development costs were paid with a combination of cash and borrowings 
we report cash flows from borrowings collateralized by notes receivable and sales of notes receivable as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the majority of bluegreen resorts sales result in the origination of notes receivable from its customers 
we believe that accelerating the conversion of such notes receivable into cash  either through the pledge or sale of our notes receivable  on a regular basis is an integral function of our operations  and have therefore classified such activities as operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities decreased million or from net cash outflows of million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to increased purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  cash flows from investing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  as we did not begin receiving cash flows on our retained interest in a term securitization transaction until the third quarter of due to reserve funding requirements 
the remainder of the increase in cash flows from investing activities was due to lower expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities decreased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this decrease was due to increased payments under line of credit facilities and notes payable  partially offset by increased proceeds from borrowings under such facilities and notes 
cash flows from financing activities decreased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the redemption of million of our senior secured notes as well as lower borrowings under our credit facilities during as compared to these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of cash in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources are provided from both internal and external sources 
our primary capital resources from internal operations are i cash sales  ii downpayments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv principal and interest payments on the purchase money mortgage loans and contracts for deed owned arising from sales of vois and homesites and v net cash generated from other resort services and other communities operations 
historically  external sources of liquidity have included non recourse sales of notes receivable  borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  seller and bank financing of inventory acquisitions and the issuance of debt securities 
our capital resources are used to support our operations  including i acquiring and developing inventory  ii providing financing for customer purchases  iii funding operating expenses and iv satisfying our debt and other obligations 
as we are continually selling and marketing real estate vois and homesites  it is necessary for us to continually acquire and develop new resorts and communities in order to maintain adequate levels of inventory to support operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to require external sources of liquidity to support our operations  satisfy our debt and other obligations and to provide funds for future acquisitions 
our level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i we have significant cash requirements to service debt  reducing funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  ii our leveraged position increases our vulnerability to competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in the indentures  the credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on  or repurchase  preferred or common stock  and iv funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be limited 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we intend to continue to pursue a growth oriented strategy  particularly with respect to our bluegreen resorts business segment 
in connection with this strategy  we may from time to time acquire  among other things  additional resort properties and completed but unsold vois  land upon which additional resorts may be built  management contracts  loan portfolios of vacation ownership mortgages  portfolios which include properties or assets which may be integrated into our operations  interests in joint ventures  and operating companies providing or possessing management  sales  marketing  development  administration and or other expertise with respect to our operations in the vacation ownership industry 
in addition  we intend to continue to focus bluegreen communities activities on larger  more capital intensive projects particularly in those regions where we believe the market for our products is strongest  such as new golf communities in the southeast and other areas and continued growth in our successful regions in texas 
the following is a discussion of our purchase and credit facilities that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding senior secured notes payable  junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to an ongoing credit facility and capital leases 
vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of of the purchase in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing and administrative expenses are primarily cash expenses and  in our case for the year ended december   approximated of sales 
accordingly  having facilities available for the hypothecation or sale of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor to our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
the ge purchase facility 
in march we executed agreements for a vacation ownership receivables purchase facility the ge purchase facility with general electric capital corporation ge 
the ge purchase facility utilizes an owner s trust structure  pursuant to which we sell receivables to bluegreen receivables finance corporation xi  our wholly owned  special purpose finance subsidiary brfc xi  and brfc xi sells the receivables to an owner s trust a qualified special purpose entity without recourse to us or brfc xi except for breaches of certain customary representations and warranties at the time of sale 
we did not enter into any guarantees in connection with the ge purchase facility 
the ge purchase facility has detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for purchase  and fundings under the ge purchase facility are subject to certain conditions precedent 
under the ge purchase facility  a variable purchase price of approximately of the principal balance of the receivables sold  subject to adjustment under certain terms and conditions  is paid at closing in cash 
the balance of the purchase price is deferred until such time as ge has received a specified return  a specified overcollateralization ratio is achieved  a cash reserve account is fully funded and all servicing  custodial  agent and similar fees and expenses have been paid 
ge earns a return equal to the applicable swap rate which is essentially a published interest swap arrangement rate as defined in the ge purchase facility agreements plus  subject to use of alternate return rates in certain circumstances 
in addition  we will pay ge a structuring fee of approximately  in march we will act as servicer under the ge purchase facility for a fee 
the ge purchase facility allows for sales of notes receivable for a cumulative purchase price of up to million for a period which ends on in march the ge purchase facility includes various conditions to purchase  covenants  trigger events and other provisions customary for a transaction of this type 
ge s obligation to purchase under the ge purchase facility may terminate earlier than the dates noted above upon the occurrence of certain specified events set forth in the ge purchase facility agreements 
these specified events  some of which are subject to materiality qualifiers and cure periods  include  without limitation  i the aggregate amount of all advances under the ge purchase facility equaling million  ii our breach of the representations or warranties in the ge purchase facility  iii our failure to perform our covenants in the ge purchase facility  iv our commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding or the like  v the amount of any advance under the ge purchase facility failing to meet a specified overcollateralization amount  vi significant delinquencies or defaults on the receivables sold  vii recovery rates falling below a pre determined amount  viii a default or breach under any other agreement beyond the applicable grace period if such default or breach a involves the failure to make a payment in excess of of our tangible net worth as defined in the ge purchase facility agreements to include our subordinated debentures or b causes  or permits the holder of indebtedness to cause  an amount in excess of of our tangible net worth to become due  ix our tangible net worth at the end of any calendar quarter not equaling at least million plus of net income following december   x the ratio of our debt excluding our subordinated debentures to tangible net worth exceeding to  xi the ratio of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to our interest expense net of interest income falling below to  xii the number of points available in the bluegreen vacation club to be less than approximately million  xiii our ceasing to conduct the vacation ownership business and originate vacation ownership receivables or if certain changes in our ownership or control occur  xiv the failure of certain of our resorts to be part of the bluegreen vacation club or be managed by us  one of our subsidiaries or another entity acceptable to ge  xv operating budgets and reserve accounts maintained by the property owners associations responsible for maintaining certain of our resorts failing to comply with applicable laws and governing documents  xvi our failure to discharge  stay or bond pending appeal any final judgments for the payment of an amount in excess of of our tangible net worth in a timely manner  xvii our default under or breach of certain resort management or marketing contracts  or xviii our failure to perform our servicing obligations  otherwise have our servicing rights terminated or if we do not exercise the servicer purchase option pursuant to the terms of the ge purchase facility 
the term securitization 
on december   bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  inc  consummated a million private offering and sale of vacation ownership receivable backed securities the term securitization 
the million in aggregate principal of vacation ownership receivables offered and sold in the term securitization were previously sold to a previous  off balance sheet vacation ownership receivables purchase facility with bb t the bb t purchase facility 
in addition  the term securitization allowed for an additional million in aggregate principal of our qualifying vacation ownership receivables the pre funded receivables that could be sold by us through march  to bluegreen receivables finance corporation x  our wholly owned  special purpose finance subsidiary brfc x  which would then sell the pre funded receivables to bxg receivables note trust a a  a qualified special purpose entity  without recourse to us or brfc x  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
the proceeds of million at an advance rate of as payment for the pre funded receivables were deposited into an escrow account by the indenture trustee of the term securitization until such receivables are actually sold by us to brfc x 
if we don t sell the pre funded receivables to earn the entire amount of related proceeds held in escrow  the remaining proceeds will be used to pay down amounts owed to investors in the term securitization 
on december   we sold million in pre funded receivables to brfc x and the million purchase price was disbursed to us from the escrow account 
on march   we sold million in pre funded receivables to brfc x and the million purchase price was disbursed to us from the escrow account 
the proceeds of the term securitization were used to pay bb t all amounts outstanding under the bb t purchase facility  pay resort finance  llc all amounts outstanding under a previous  on balance sheet purchase facility  pay fees associated with the transaction to third parties  deposit initial amounts in a required cash reserve account and the escrow accounts for the pre funded receivables and provide net cash proceeds of million to us 
we also received a retained interest in the future cash flows from the term securitization including the future cash flows from the pre funded receivables actually sold 
the new bb t purchase facility 
we are currently in documentation for a new  two year million vacation ownership receivables purchase facility with bb t 
there can be no assurances that this new facility will be obtained on favorable terms or at all 
we anticipate accounting for sales of receivables under this facility  if obtained  as on balance sheet borrowings pursuant to sfas this facility would be used to accumulate receivables in anticipation of future term securitization transactions 
we have chosen to monetize our receivables through the ge purchase facility and through periodic term securitization transactions historically  as these off balance sheet arrangements provide us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have generated gains on our income statement on a quarterly basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
the ge purchase facility discussed above is the only ongoing receivables purchase facilities under which we currently have the ability to sell receivables 
factors which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new or additional vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities include a downturn in general economic conditions  negative trends in the commercial paper or libor markets  increases in interest rates  a decrease in the number of financial institutions or other entities willing to enter into facilities with vacation ownership companies  a deterioration in the performance of our vacation ownership notes receivable or in the performance of portfolios sold in prior transactions  specifically increased delinquency  default and loss severity rates  and a deterioration in our performance generally 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain new purchase facilities to replace the ge purchase facility when this facility is fully funded or expires 
as indicated above  our inability to sell vacation ownership receivables under a current or future facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
however  management believes that to the extent we could not sell receivables under a purchase facility  we could potentially mitigate the adverse impact on our liquidity by using our receivables as collateral under existing or future credit facilities 
historically  we have also been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
in each transaction  the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity has a retained interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable securitization transaction  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interests in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  make interest and principal payments to investors  fund required reserves  if any  and pay distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents  however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds go to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the use of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent there was any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization facility certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee 
we recognized an other than temporary decrease of  during  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold

under an existing million revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc foothill primarily used for borrowings collateralized by bluegreen communities receivables and inventory  we can also borrow up to million of the facility collateralized by the pledge of vacation ownership receivables 
see credit facilities for bluegreen communities receivables and inventories  below  for further details on this facility 
credit facilities for bluegreen communities receivables and inventories the foothill facility 
we have a million revolving credit facility with foothill secured by the pledge of bluegreen communities receivables  with up to million of the total facility available for bluegreen communities inventory borrowings and  as indicated above  up to million of the total facility available for the pledge of bluegreen resorts receivables the foothill facility

the gmac communities facility 
in may and again in march  we amended our existing million revolving credit facility with rfc the gmac communities facility 
the gmac communities facility is secured by the real property homesites and personal property related thereto at the following bluegreen communities projects  as well as any bluegreen communities projects acquired by us with funds borrowed under the gmac communities facility the secured projects brickshire new kent county  virginia  mountain lakes ranch bluffdale  texas  ridge lake shores magnolia  texas  riverwood forest fulshear  texas  waterstone boerne  texas  catawba falls preserve black mountain  north carolina  lake ridge at joe pool lake cedar hill and grand prairie  texas  mystic shores at canyon lake spring branch  texas  yellowstone creek ranch pueblo  colorado  and havenwood at hunters crossing new braunfels  texas the texas property 
in addition  the gmac communities facility is secured by our carolina national and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses in southport  north carolina and chapel hill  north carolina  respectively 
borrowings can be drawn on such projects through september  principal payments are effected through agreed upon release prices paid to rfc as homesites in the secured projects are sold 
the outstanding principal balance of any borrowings under the gmac communities facility must be repaid by september  the interest charged on outstanding borrowings is at the prime lending rate plus at december  
interest payments are due monthly 
the gmac communities facility includes customary conditions to funding  acceleration and event of default provisions and certain financial affirmative and negative covenants 
we use the proceeds from the gmac communities facility to repay outstanding indebtedness on bluegreen communities projects  finance the acquisition and development of bluegreen communities projects and for general corporate purposes 
in july  we borrowed million under the gmac communities facility in connection with the acquisition of havenwood at hunters crossing and an additional million in april for general corporate purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under the gmac communities facility 
in march  we borrowed million under the gmac communities facility for the acquisition of a new property in grayson county  texas and an additional million for general corporate purposes 
over the past several years  substantially all of our homesite sales have been for cash and we have not provided a significant amount of financing to homesite purchasers 
accordingly  in recent years we have reduced the borrowing capacity under credit agreements secured by bluegreen communities receivables 
we attribute the significant volume of cash sales to an increased willingness on the part of banks to extend direct customer homesite financing at attractive interest rates 
no assurances can be given that local banks will continue to provide such customer financing 
historically  we have funded development for road and utility construction  amenities  surveys and engineering fees from internal operations and have financed the acquisition of bluegreen communities properties through seller  bank or financial institution loans 
terms for repayment under these loans typically call for interest to be paid monthly and principal to be repaid through homesite releases 
the release price is usually an amount based on a pre determined percentage typically to of the gross selling price of the homesites in the subdivision 
in addition  the agreements generally call for minimum cumulative annual amortization 
when we provide financing for our customers and therefore the release price is not available in cash at closing to repay the lender  we are required to pay the lender with cash derived from other operating activities  principally from cash sales or the pledge of receivables originated from earlier property sales 
trust preferred securities offerings we have formed statutory business trusts collectively  the trusts and each issued trust preferred securities and invested the proceeds thereof in our junior subordinated debentures 
the trusts are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the operations of the trusts  instead  the trusts are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in each of these transactions  the applicable trust issued trust preferred securities as part of a larger pooled trust securities offering which was not registered under the securities act of the applicable trust then used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at the same interest rate 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the company s option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we made an initial equity contribution to each trust in exchange for its common securities  all of which are owned by us  and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the terms of each trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities 
we had the following junior subordinated debentures outstanding at december  dollars in thousands outstanding amount of initial fixed variable beginning junior equity interest interest optional subordinated to issue rate rate redemption maturity trust debentures trust date date date bluegreen statutory trust i  libor bluegreen statutory trust ii  libor bluegreen statutory trust iii  libor both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a fixed interest rate from the issue date through the beginning optional redemption date 
both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a variable interest rate from the beginning optional redemption date through the maturity date 
we currently intend to seek to create similar trusts and to participate in other pooled trust preferred securities transactions in the future as a source of additional financing  subject to market conditions and other considerations 
unsecured credit facility we have a million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at one month libor plus at december  
interest is due monthly and all outstanding amounts are due on june  borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an amount which is less than the remaining availability under our current  active vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities plus availability under certain receivables warehouse facilities  less any outstanding letters of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line  however  an aggregate of  of irrevocable letters of credit were outstanding under this line of credit at december  these letters of credit expire on december  this line of credit is an available source of short term liquidity 
commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our vacation ownership and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following table summarizes the contractual minimum principal payments required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases by period date  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations less than after year years years years total receivable backed notes payable    lines of credit and notes payable     senior secured notes   jr 
subordinated debentures   noncancelable operating leases      total contractual obligations      the following table sets forth certain information regarding future interest obligations on outstanding debt as of december  in thousands payments due by period interest obligations less than after year years years years total receivable backed notes payable      lines of credit and notes payable    senior secured notes    jr 
subordinated debentures      total contractual obligations      interest on variable rate debt has assumed the weighted average interest rate remains the same as the rate at december  we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale of vacation ownership notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the principal payments required on contractual cbligations 
while we believe that we will be able to meet all required debt payments when due  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
as noted above  we have  in letters of credit outstanding at december   the majority of which were issued under the unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na these letters of credit  which expire in  were required in connection with the obtaining of governmental approval of plats for one of our bluegreen communities projects 
we estimate that the total cash required to complete resort buildings in which sales have occurred and resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  we estimate that the total cash required to complete our bluegreen communities projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next five years primarily with available capacity on existing or proposed credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing or generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we will seek to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including  our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
most of our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities which include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  limits on the repurchase of securities  restrictions on the payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  limitations on the incurrence of liens and transactions with affiliates  covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios and portfolio performance requirements  and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will be in compliance with such covenants  that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during the year ended december  were less than of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated and long term debt incurred to date by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we did not sell any vacation ownership notes receivable off balance sheet in and sold  million and million of fixed rate vacation ownership notes receivable off balance sheet during and  respectively  under various vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities and term securitization transactions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our gains on sale recognized are generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates 
we believe that we have used appropriate assumptions in valuing the residual interests retained in the vacation ownership and land notes sold through our various off balance sheet vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities and term securitization transactions and that such assumptions should mitigate the impact of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on these valuations  but there is no assurance that the assumptions will prove to be correct 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prevailing prime or libor rates  as applicable  would decrease our after tax earnings by an immaterial amount per year  as a result of increased interest expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by the increased interest income on variable rate bluegreen communities notes receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
a similar change in interest rates would decrease the total fair value of our fixed rate debt  excluding our senior secured notes payable the notes by an immaterial amount 
the fact that the notes are publicly traded in the over the counter market makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the notes 
due to the non interest related factors involved in determining the fair value of these publicly traded securities  their fair values have historically demonstrated increased  decreased or at times contrary relationships to changes in interest rates as compared to other types of fixed rate debt securities 
the analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of such a change  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
