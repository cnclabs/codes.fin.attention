summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or liquidity 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standard  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective january   these assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
this standard will become effective in the first quarter of the method of determining the grant date fair value of stock options under fas r is the same as the method currently being used by the company to calculate the pro forma impact on net income and earnings per share as presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
accordingly  we do not expect the impact of the adoption of fas r on net income and earnings per share will be materially different from the current pro forma disclosures 
the company may elect one of two methods for adoption of fas r 
under the modified prospective method  any awards that are granted or modified after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for under fas r 
the unvested portion of previously granted awards will continue to be accounted for under fas  accounting for stock based compensation  except that the compensation expense associated with the unvested portions will be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective method  all amounts previously reported are restated to reflect the amounts previously reported in fas pro forma disclosure 
the company has elected to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
therefore  previously reported financial data will not be restated  and expense related to stock options vesting during and later will be recorded as additional compensation expense 
during  the company estimates noninterest expense related to stock options vesting during the year will be approximately before taxes  which will reduce net income by approximately or per basic share 
this estimate is subject to change due to the number of options actually granted or forfeited during the year 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for   and table i  average balance analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
changes not solely due to volume or rate are allocated to rate 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points from to 
generally  the decline in the net interest margin in when compared to can be attributed to the bank s cost of funds rising faster than the yield on its loan portfolio 
for the year  interest and fees earned on earning assets increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes and improved  due to higher yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning assets 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses for the year  were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields increased by basis points  from in to in the improvement in earning asset yield was primarily due to increased loan yields  which were up basis points in over the increase in loan yields is reflective of the consistent increase in the prime lending rate throughout the year interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by  or over referring to table i  overall average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  or over  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to 
referring to table ii  interest expense increased by  due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table ii also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional  due to higher rates  a direct result of the increase in short term market interest rates throughout the year table ii shows the increase in the average volumes of money market and now accounts  time deposits  and fhlb borrowings  were primarily responsible for the increase in interest expense due to higher volumes for when compared to again referring to table ii  the increase in interest expense for the year over resulting from higher rates was primarily due to increased rates paid on money market and now accounts and time deposits 
table i shows the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or and average time deposit volume increased  or over average volumes  while the rate on these deposits increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
the increase in time deposit volume primarily involved local market time deposits in excess of  national time deposits  and public deposits 
table ii shows that the increase in the average volume of fhlb term borrowings accounted for  or of the total increase in interest expense for the year over that was related to volume 
however  lower rates paid on fhlb advances during the year when compared to mitigated a portion of the increase in interest expense from the higher usage of fhlb advances 
the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year  average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over average noninterest bearing deposits funded of total average assets for the year during  the federal reserve continued to increase short term rates as they did during the last six month of from january through december  the federal reserve increased short term interest rates by basis points on top of the basis point increase in short term rates during the last six months of the increase in market interest rates during increased the bank s prime lending rate from at the beginning of the year to at year end although the bank is asset sensitive  meaning the net interest margin should improve during a rising rate environment  the increases in market interest rates during had little positive effect on the net interest margin 
this was primarily the result of two factors 
first  a flattening yield curve  where long term rates rose at a much slower pace than short term rates keeping the yields on fixed rate loans low  thus narrowing the spread between the bank s borrowing and core deposit costs and the yield on its fixed rate loan portfolio 
second  consistently throughout the year  there was a timing lag between the increases in short term money market rates  which moved borrowing costs and deposit rates up in advance of the bank s prime lending rate also creating margin compression 
the month of december was the first full month of financial results that included activity from the nwbf acquisition 
the bank s net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the full month of december was 
the drop in the net interest margin was expected as a result of the combination of the two entities due to the higher level of wholesale funding and lower net interest margin for nwbf 
prior to the acquisition  nwbf s net interest margin ranged from to on a monthly basis 
looking forward to the first quarter  the company expects the net interest margin to be flat to down slightly from the net interest margin recorded for the month of december historically  the bank s oregon market experiences flat to negative growth in its core deposit base during the first quarter of each year  while loan activity remains strong 
this would potentially decrease the bank s net interest margin as the reduction in core deposits typically occurs in lower cost demand and commercial money market accounts 
however  further increases in market interest rates  plus a more normal yield curve  where long term rates are higher than short term rates  could mitigate any decline in the net interest margin due to a reduction in the bank s core deposit base 
the company believes there are opportunities during the course of to improve the net interest margin through core deposit growth 
the company believes that when nwbf operations and systems are fully integrated and converted  that the company s image technology and on line cash management products geared to the specific market segments the bank desires  will provide a competitive advantage in the new seattle market 
in addition  the new office in the bank s portland market is expected to contribute to core deposit growth in the oregon market during compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  the net interest income as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points  from in to 
short term market interest rates were stable during the first six months of and were at a year low 
beginning on june   the federal reserve began to take measured steps to increase short term market rates during the last half of during this six month period  short term market interest rates moved up on five occasions in basis point increments for a total increase of basis points 
during this period  the prime lending rate increased from to 
the bank s net interest margin did not immediately benefit from the increase in the prime rate as approximately  of the bank s variable rate loan portfolio had active floors above the calculated rate 
the basis point increase in the prime lending rate in november removed all active loan floors on variable rate loans 
as a result  the bank s net interest margin improved during the fourth quarter to 
that compares to net interest margins of   and for the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively 
interest and fees earned on earning assets during increased by  or over referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes  which was partially offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  a increase over average earning asset levels 
growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to loan growth as average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses for the year  were up  or over referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by basis points  from in to in yields on loans and securities available for sale contributed to the overall decline in earning asset yields during the yield on average loans  which made up of earning asset volumes during  was primarily responsible for the decline in earning asset yields during loan yields for were  a decline of basis points from loan yields of recorded during the decline in loan yields is reflective of fixed rate loans booked during the prolonged low interest rate environment during the past two years  combined with active floors on variable rate loans above the calculated rate 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities during increased by or over referring to table i  overall average interest bearing liabilities in increased by  or over  while the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points from to 
referring to table ii  interest expense increased by due to the change in the mix and increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
table ii also indicates that interest expense for the year increased an additional due to rates as a result of the increase in short term market interest rates during the last half of table ii shows the increase in the volume and the increase in the rate on money market and now accounts were primarily responsible for the increased interest expense during referring to table i the average volume of money market and now accounts increased  or over  while the rates on these deposits increased basis points from in to in a portion of the increase in interest expense due to increased volume and rate of money market and now accounts was offset by a decline in volume and rate of time deposits 
referring to table i  average time deposits in were  or below and the rate paid on time deposits dropped by basis points from in to in table ii shows that the decline in volume and rate for the time deposit category reduced noninterest expense in by and  respectively  or a total of the decline in time deposit volume was primarily the result of national time deposits that matured during and were not renewed 
the decline in the rates on time deposits is reflective of the lag effect on time deposit rates in a rising rate environment 
although market interest rates moved up during the last six months of the year  time deposit rates remained low as many of these deposits were booked during the prolonged low interest rate environment during and the first half of the company s net interest margin benefited from growth in noninterest bearing deposits

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  in  and in the higher provision for reflected growth in the bank s outstanding loans during the year 
the lower provision in compared to reflected improved credit quality in the bank s loan portfolio and a reduction in the level of nonperforming assets throughout the year 
nonperforming assets at december  were or of year end assets 
that compares to  of nonperforming assets at december  or of year end assets 
at december   the bank had two residential properties in foreclosed assets with a value of subsequent to the end of the year  the bank sold one of these properties for a gain on sale of a sale on the second property is pending and is expected to close prior to the end of the first quarter the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of outstanding loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
the december  allowance for loan losses included  in allowance added through the acquisition of nwbf 
at december   the bank also has reserved for possible losses on unfunded loan commitments  which is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
at december   the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans was  or more than times the level of the total nonperforming loans 
that compares to at year end december  the ending allowance includes in specific allowance for impaired loans 
at december   the company had of impaired loans net of government guarantees consisting of in nonperforming loans and two loans to a single borrower totaling that are performing under revised terms 
these loans to the single borrower had a specific allowance of at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of net loan charge offs were in compared to in  and in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were   and for   and  respectively 
going forward into  the provision for loans losses will be contingent on current economic and market conditions  the successful integration of nwbf s loan portfolio  and overall loan growth  as there is only limited benefit available from further improvement in the loan portfolio credit statistics 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses in the portfolio at year end based on management s assessment of various factors including present past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income is derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to noninterest income in was  a decrease of or from the decline in noninterest income was primarily due to five categories account service charges  nsf od fees  residential mortgage revenues  merchant bankcard fees  and loan servicing fees 
account service charges were down or from last year as the increase in the day treasury bill rate increased the earnings credit on analyzed business demand accounts  which lowered hard dollar fee income on these accounts 
nsf od fees in dropped  or from due to lower transaction volume 
revenues from the origination of residential mortgages were down or from as a result of higher long term interest rates during the year that slowed loan originations 
the merchant bankcard division achieved a growth in sales transaction volume in over however  competitive pricing pressures resulted in a lower profit margin  thus reducing noninterest income from this division by or from loan servicing fees in declined by or from due to a decline in the level of loans serviced for and participated to other financial institutions 
for the month of december  total noninterest income was  with the newly acquired seattle market contributing approximately to the total 
although the fee schedule for the seattle market is lower than the oregon markets  the bank will not consider any changes in the seattle fee structure until after systems conversion  which is scheduled for the first quarter in the oregon market  new fee increases went into effect on january   which is expected to add approximately to total noninterest income during the year 
compared to noninterest income in was  down or from year the decline in noninterest income was attributable to two categories 
mortgage banking income and gains on sales of loans in decreased or from the previous year 
mortgage banking revenues accounted for of the decline in this category as higher long term interest rates significantly reduced the level of refinancing 
gains on the sales of loans were down as the bank recorded a one time gain on the sale of loans of in there were no loan sales during in addition to the decline in mortgage banking revenues and gains on sales of loans  the bank s loan servicing income decreased by due to an overall decline in the level of participated loans 
the decrease in these two noninterest income categories was partially offset by a or increase in other fee income  principally merchant bankcard processing revenues 
noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than the provision for loan losses and interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to noninterest expense in was  up  or over the acquisition of nwbf accounted for approximately of the total expense increase 
in addition  the bank incurred approximately in merger related expenses that will ultimately be eliminated following the systems conversion scheduled for first quarter the increase in expenses in over resulted primarily from increased personnel expense  premises and equipment expense  advertising  and various other expenses 
personnel expenses were up  or in over reflecting increased staffing  increased accruals for incentive compensation  and higher group insurance costs 
group insurance expense accounted for of the total increase in personnel cost for the year occupancy and equipment expense in was up or over reflecting remodeling costs of the bank s olive street office in eugene  oregon  elimination of rental income from the bank s olive street office  and rent expense for the seattle market offices 
the increase in business development expense of in over was primarily the result of a planned increase in advertising expense related to production costs of new media campaigns and increased media and specialty advertising in the portland market 
various other expense categories  primarily sundry losses  travel  and subscription expenses  accounted for the increase in the other expense category 
beginning with the first quarter  the company will begin to record noninterest expense related to stock option grants vesting during the year as required by fas r 
the company estimates that this non cash expense will be approximately for the year  but is subject to change depending on the number of options granted and forfeited during the year 
in addition  the bank will record approximately in noninterest expense during for the amortization of the core deposit intangible related to the acquisition of nwbf 
compared to noninterest expense in was  an increase of or over the same period in comparing to  the largest increase was in personnel expense  which grew by  or over the previous year  reflecting personnel costs for staff added during the last half and and increased group insurance expense 
staff additions were primarily related to expansion in the portland market 
increased salaries  incentive compensation  k contribution and payroll taxes accounted for of the increase in personnel expense for the year when compared to increased group insurance costs  primarily medical insurance  accounted for of the increase in personnel expense 
for the year  group insurance expense was above the previous year for the same period 
business development expense in was  a or increase as the bank s new branding campaign was implemented during the year 
growth in these noninterest expense categories was offset by a decrease in other real estate expense 
other real estate expense in declined by approximately as included expenses related to write downs and operating losses associated with motel and hotel properties which were sold during during  the company incurred incremental expenses totaling  primarily in the fourth quarter  related to compliance with section of sarbanes oxley in terms of software  audit fees and professional consulting services 
the incremental expense related to compliance with section does not include substantial staff time spent on this project

the federal reserve board and the fdic has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
these guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
the regulations also specify that a total risk based capital ratio is required to be designated well capitalized the highest fdic capital rating by the fdic 
the company s tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  and deposit based intangibles  totaled  at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits

off balance sheet arrangements and commitments in the normal course of business  the bank commits to extensions of credit and issues letters of credit 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend funds and conditional obligations as it does for other credit products 
in the event of nonperformance by the customer  the bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract 
since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december   the bank had  in commitments to extend credit 
letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   the bank had  in letters of credit and financial guarantees written 
the bank also has internal guidance lines of credit established for certain borrowers  primarily in the residential construction industry 
these guidance lines are not contractual commitments to extend credit  and may be terminated by the bank for any reason without any obligation to the borrower 
these lines provide the bank s lenders limits on future extensions of credit to certain borrowers 
the bank uses the same credit policies in establishing internal guidance lines as it does for other credit products

the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity primarily through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits  including local time deposits in excess of additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  the decrease in the percentage of core deposits to total deposits from was due to the acquisition of nwbf 
prior to the november  acquisition  nwbf s core deposits as a percentage of total deposits was approximately 
excluding the acquisition of nwbf  core deposit growth of approximately  in the oregon market funded of loan growth during the year following the acquisition of nwbf on november   the bank increased its alternative funding sources  including overnight borrowed funds  federal home loan bank term advances  public deposits available from the state of oregon  state of washington  and national market time deposits 
the company has deposit relationships with several large clients  which are closely monitored by bank officers 
at december   thirteen large deposit relationships with the bank account for  or of total deposits 
the single largest client represented of total deposits at december  the loss of this deposit relationship or other large deposit relationships could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain these relationships and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate the loss of one or more of these clients 
borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at year end december   the bank had secured and unsecured borrowing lines totaling approximately  consisting of  with the federal home loan bank of seattle   with various correspondent banks  and  with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the federal home loan bank borrowing line is limited to the amount of collateral pledged 
at december   the bank had approximately  in commercial real estate loans pledged as collateral discounted collateral value of  for this line 
the  borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco is also secured 
the  in borrowing lines with correspondent banks are unsecured lines 
at december   the bank had  in borrowings outstanding all from the fhlb of seattle 
in addition  the bank is part of the state of oregon and state of washington community bank time deposit program and at december  had  available from these sources 
the bank s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although permitted by its funds management policy  the company does not presently use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
a more reasonable approach utilizes gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time to determine the effect on the company s net interest income 
the company utilizes the services of the federal home loan bank s asset liability modeling software to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in basis point increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
the more realistic forecast assumes a gradual interest rate movement of plus or minus basis points change in the federal funds rate over a one year period of time with rates moving up or down basis points each quarter 
the model used is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
during  the model indicated that the company continued to be asset sensitive and projects rising margins in a rising rate environment and declining margins in a falling rate environment 
the company s interest rate risk profile at december  is not materially different from its interest rate risk profile at december  the following tables show the estimated impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
tables show results of company supplied data for both the rate shock and gradual interest rate scenarios 
the base figure of  used in both analyses represents actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results 
interest rate shock analysis net interest income and market value performance in thousands projected net interest income interest estimated change change rate change value from base from base base gradual interest rate movement forecast net interest income and market value performance in thousands projected net interest income interest estimated change change rate change value from base from base rising base declining during the fourth quarter  the fhlb of seattle informed the bank that it would no longer provide interest rate risk modeling services after the completion of the december  interest rate risk report 
the bank has purchased in house software and beginning in the first quarter will use this software to measure its interest rate risk position
