item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain line items from our consolidated statements of operations stated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product sales contract revenue royalties total revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of contract revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss product sales product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware and software products 
hardware products include adsl test and development systems  modules  and modems 
software products consist of standard off the shelf software products for biometric  medical imaging and digital imaging applications  as well as dsl test and diagnostics software 
product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenue from the sale of software products  which was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from the sale of hardware products 
product sales increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  product sales decreased from in to in the dollar increase was due to a million increase in revenue from the sale of software products  which was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from the sale of hardware products 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of license and engineering service fees that we receive under agreements with our customers to develop dsl including adsl  adslplus or vdsl chipsets 
contract revenue decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar decrease in was from million lower revenue from existing customers which was partially offset by million of revenue from new customers 
contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar increase in was from million higher revenue from existing customers and million from new customers 
the environment for licensing intellectual property for communications integrated circuits continues to be difficult 
both existing and prospective dsl chipset licensees have been reluctant to begin new development projects given i generally weak worldwide economic conditions  ii a difficult and uncertain environment in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries  and iii intense dsl chipset competition and falling chipset prices 
during the last several years  customers and potential customers cautiously evaluated new chipset projects or delayed or cancelled projects in the face of such conditions 
royalties royalties consist of royalty payments that we receive under licensing agreements 
we receive royalties from customers for the right to use our technology in their chipsets or solutions 
royalties decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties decreased from in to in the dollar decrease in royalties was due to a million decrease in adsl royalties and a million decrease in biometrics and medical imaging royalties 
royalties increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  royalties decreased from in to in the dollar increase in royalties was due to a million increase in adsl royalties and a million increase in biometrics and medical imaging royalties 
our royalty revenue came predominantly from adsl chipset sales by analog devices  inc adi  and infineon technologies ag infineon 
despite steady growth of worldwide adsl subscribers over the last several years  the availability of adsl chipsets from a number of suppliers and intense competition among those suppliers has caused chipset prices to steadily decline 
we are uncertain how quickly sales of our customers chipsets will increase and whether such increases will contribute meaningful royalties to us 
cost of product sales since the cost of software product sales is minimal  cost of product sales consists primarily of the cost of hardware product sales 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in cost of product sales decreased in due to a decrease in hardware product sales 
the increase in overall product margins was due to a larger proportion of software sales in the product sales revenue mix 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of product sales  cost of product sales decreased from in to in cost of product sales decreased in due to a decrease in hardware product sales 
the increase in overall product margins was due to a larger proportion of software sales in the product sales revenue mix 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  technology licensing fees  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities associated with customer development projects 
our total engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenue and research and development expense 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between cost of contract revenue and research and development is a function of the level of effort expended on each 
cost of contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue increased from in to in the dollar increase in cost of contract revenue was due to an increase in engineering services contracts and an increase in cost of contract revenues associated with stratiphy licensing contracts 
cost of contract revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of contract revenue  cost of contract revenue decreased from in to in the dollar increase in cost of contract revenue was due to more customer contracts and higher contract revenue in as compared to research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries for engineers and expenses for consultants  recruiting  supplies  equipment  depreciation and facilities related to engineering projects to improve our broadband intellectual property offerings  as well as our software and hardware product technology 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense increased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily from higher compensation and fringe benefit costs of million  and higher chip and board design and development costs of million 
these cost increases were partially offset by million decreased spending resulting from a shift of engineers to customer projects  where spending is classified as cost of contract revenue 
this shift occurred because we had more customer projects in than in the dollar increase was also reduced by million lower depreciation expense 
our research and development spending was principally focused on improving our adsl  adsl and adslplus stratiphy tm technology and chips  developing and improving our vdsl stratiphy technology and chips  developing analog front end technology for dsl solutions  developing test and diagnostics hardware and software and developing imaging and biometrics software 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased from in to in the dollar decrease was primarily from million decreased spending resulting from a shift of engineers to customer projects  where spending is classified as cost of contract revenue 
this shift occurred because we had more customer projects in than in the dollar decrease in spending was also attributable to million lower compensation and fringe benefit costs and million lower depreciation expense 
on january  the salary reductions for employees and salary reductions for senior management effective  january  were eliminated and the january  salaries were reinstated for those employees that were affected by the salary reduction 
this salary reinstatement increased total engineering expenses by million  and increased total company expenses by million 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  travel  advertising and promotion  recruiting  and facilities expense 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense increased from in to in the dollar and percentage increases were primarily due to million higher spending on compensation and fringe benefit costs 
sales and marketing expense was approximately million in both and as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased from in to in the percentage decrease was primarily due to higher revenue in as compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  facility costs  bad debt  audit  legal  stock exchange and insurance expenses 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense increased from in to in the dollar and percentage increases were primarily due to million higher spending on compensation and fringe benefit costs partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense decreased from in to in the dollar increase was primarily due to a million lower provision for bad debts in compared with  and a million increase in professional fees and insurance 
these increases were reduced by a million decrease in depreciation expense 
interest income interest income increased or from million in to million in the dollar increase was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our investments throughout interest income decreased or  in and was approximately million in both and the dollar decrease was primarily due to lower cash balances 
income taxes we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the positive and negative evidence affecting the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of incurring operating losses since  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized  and since the fourth quarter of have established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax benefit for the operating losses incurred in the years ended december  and in  we determined that due to our continuing operating losses in and as well as the uncertainty of the timing of profitability in future periods  we should fully reserve our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded a tax provision of million in to reserve for our remaining deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carry forwards of approximately million and million respectively  which may be available to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates from through in addition  at december   we had approximately million and million of state net operating losses and state research and development and investment tax carry forwards  respectively  which expire at various dates from through ownership changes  if any  as defined in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
of the total net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was recorded  approximately million is attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in march  we have financed our activities primarily through the sale of stock 
in the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of million  million and million  respectively 
our operating activities used net cash of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in our operating activities was primarily the result of operating losses and working capital requirements 
in the years ended december    and  we made capital expenditures of million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in all three years primarily consisted of spending on computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment  and furniture used principally in engineering activities 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
in the year ended december  we purchased million of other assets 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments of million 
while we can not assure you that we will not require additional financing  or that such financing will be available to us  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase orders total critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes revenue from the sale of hardware and software products for the automated test equipment market and software products for the biometrics  medical and digital imaging markets  ii contract revenue  which includes patent  license and engineering service fees that we receive under customer agreements  and iii royalties that we receive under customer agreements 
as prescribed by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we also apply the principles set forth in aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  when recognizing software revenue 
our revenue recognition policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as described below  we make significant judgments and estimates during the process of determining revenue for any particular accounting period 
in determining revenue recognition  we assess whether fees associated with revenue transactions are fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we make a judgment whether fees are fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with that transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured 
in addition to these general revenue recognition judgments  we make specific judgments and estimates with respect to the recognition of contract revenue 
when our agreements include the delivery of licensing rights and technology as well as the provision of engineering services  we combine the total patent  license and engineering service fees to be paid under the agreement 
these total fees are recognized ratably over the expected product development period  subject to the limitation that the cumulative revenue recognized through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments to date 
we review assumptions regarding the product development period on a regular basis and make adjustments as required 
consistent with the principles of sab  we believe that this method represents the appropriate systematic method for revenue recognition for this type of contract 
after customers enter into development and license agreements  they often engage us to provide additional engineering work that is beyond the scope of their original agreement 
when customers request additional services  both parties agree to engineering fees that are based on the level of effort required 
we recognize revenue from these agreements either as engineering services are performed or as milestones are achieved 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense 
we must also estimate temporary and permanent differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period for deferred tax assets  which have been recognized  we must include an expense with the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses and research and development tax credits that we are carrying forward into future tax periods 
as of december   we had a total of million of deferred tax assets for which we had recorded a full valuation allowance 
of the total valuation allowance  approximately million relates to net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards that are attributable to the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital  if realized in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
if the judgments we make to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for sfas r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for us in our fiscal year beginning january  we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements fas 
fas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
fas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the provisions of this statement are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  and the effect that changes in interest rates would have on that portfolio 
our investment portfolio has included o cash and cash equivalents  which consist of financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less  o short term investments  which consist of financial instruments with remaining maturities of twelve months or less  and auction rate securities that typically have interest reset dates of twenty eight days  and o investments  which consist of financial instruments that mature in three years or less 
all of our investments meet the high quality standards specified in our investment policy 
this policy dictates the maturity period and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
the interest rates on our auction rate securities are typically reset by auction every twenty eight days 
although our auction rate securities have been readily marketable  if an auction were to fail  we may not be able to sell these securities on the planned reset date thereby increasing our holding period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had invested million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that matured in twelve months or less 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  we do not expect that an increase in interest rates would result in any material loss to our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no long term investments
