information relating to these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  the company revised its segment reporting to include its aggregate european operations as a separate segment 
this change was made as a result of the significant european acquisition made in the company believes this segment reporting better reflects how its four business segments retail  wholesale  european and licensing are managed and each segment s performance is evaluated 
the european segment includes both wholesale and retail operations in europe 
the retail segment includes the company s retail operations in north america

the company reports comparable store sales for its full price retail and factory outlet stores in the us and canada 
a store is considered comparable after it has been open for full months 
if a store remodel or relocation results in a square footage change of more than  the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size or in its new location for full months 
executive summary the company continued to see improvement in its business which resulted in a solid financial performance for the fiscal year 
the company benefited from the impact of the european acquisition  comparable store sales growth  retail store expansion  and an improved product mix with a strong accessories presence 
these improvements resulted in a increase in net revenues to million in from million in overall  the company improved gross margins by basis points in the growth in the overall gross margin was due to the increased volume of sales in the high margin european business for the year ended december   improved leverage of store occupancy and higher product profitability  partially offset by a lower proportion of licensing revenue as a percentage of the overall revenue 
the factors listed above  combined with a slightly lower sg a rate  drove a increase in profitability in with net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  compared with net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  in the company continued to significantly improve its financial strength as shown in its balance sheet

about of this change was attributable to our european business where inventories increased by million 
our retail segment  including full priced retail  factory outlet  canada  and e commerce  generated net sales of million during  an increase of  from million in the prior year 
this growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of and a larger store base  which represented an increase in average square footage as compared to the growth in net revenue reflects the successful product assortment achieved in across our accessories  marciano  women s and men s lines of business 
earnings from operations increased by million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and improved gross profit especially due to occupancy leverage  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
we have been testing our two new stand alone store concepts  marciano and guess accessories  and we believe that over time these concepts can grow to become significant chains in north america 
the marciano brand  our contemporary line that commands higher price points  is available in approximately of our full price retail stores in the us and canada 
we opened nine marciano stores and six accessories stores and closed one accessories store in in  as we did in  we will increase the number of stores in these concepts in key locations in the us and canada  and around the world  while we continue to refine their product assortment and streamline store execution to maximize their potential

at year end  we had marciano stores and guess accessories stores 
this compares to stores a year ago 
while we continue to see the wholesale operations in north america becoming a smaller proportion of our overall business as our european and retail businesses expand  we have seen some improvements in the domestic wholesale gross margin and sg a rates 
in addition  we have experienced sales growth in our non european  international wholesale operations 
the wholesale segment revenues for increased to million from million in driven by non european  international wholesale revenue growth of million

our licensing business performed well in  and grew year over year despite the loss of licensing revenue from our european licensee that we acquired in january overall  licensing revenues increased by million to million in compared to million in while licensing operating earnings remained flat at million 
the growth was primarily driven by the strength of our eyewear  handbag and watch licensees  partially offset by the loss of royalty income from our european jeanswear licensee

application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  workers compensation accrual and evaluation of net recoverable amounts and accruals for the sublet of certain lease obligations 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers  after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria and generally requires no collateral 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collections trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its goodwill and long lived assets ie  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assets are considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
as additional information becomes available  the company assesses the potential liability related to pending litigation and revises estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk the company received united states dollars usd for approximately of product sales and licensing revenue based on revenues during the year ended december  inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in usd  however  purchase prices for products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the usd and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to the company in usd 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on inventory costs 
due to the increase in foreign currency transactions and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner as the usd  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the effect of currency fluctuations on future income 
the company s primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in canada and europe 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  to manage exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
these financial instruments can be used to protect the company from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically through the income statement or through stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
the classification depends on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  and if so  whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
generally  changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are matched in the income statement against the respective gain or loss relating to the hedged items 
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective as hedges  are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes 
changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are currently reported in income 
the company s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
thus  changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are included in net earnings 
forward exchange contracts usd equivalent maturity date fair value in usd at december  canadian dollars january  to january  canadian dollars february  to february  canadian dollars march  to march  canadian dollars april  to april  canadian dollars may  to may  based upon the rates at december   the cost to buy the equivalent usd discussed above was approximately million canadian dollars 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts to purchase million usd and the fair value of those contracts at that date was million usd 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts to purchase million usd and the fair value of those contracts at that date was million usd

at december   of the company s indebtedness contained a fixed interest rate of 
substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  including any borrowings under the credit facility or from european banks  is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the fair value of the company s debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company s borrowing rate 
at december   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company s debt approximates rates currently available to the company
