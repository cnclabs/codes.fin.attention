table of contents fpic insurance group  inc and subsidiaries our business strategy our business strategy is designed to provide long term value for our shareholders  while providing our clients with competitive products and responsive service 
over the ten years ended december   we  and our predecessor company  on average  have achieved a return on average equity excluding the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles of  with a high of in and  and a low of in our primary objective is to maintain a financially strong  stable and consistently profitable organization by adhering to the following principles a focus on selected markets where we have extensive knowledge and expertise 
we target selected market areas within our insurance and insurance management segments where we can establish a meaningful presence and leverage local market knowledge and experience 
mpl insurance markets vary substantially on a state by state basis  with each state having its own unique regulatory  legislative  judicial and competitive environment 
we believe our understanding of our target markets provides us with significant competitive advantages in terms of underwriting  pricing  claims management and policyholder service 
in addition  our focus on selected markets has allowed us to achieve strong positions in those markets  providing benefits in terms of brand recognition  resources and efficiencies 
we believe that the ability to manage our business effectively and compete within the unique environment of each state is critical to our success 
recruit and retain experienced management 
we have an experienced management team with diverse expertise in insurance  accounting  finance and legal disciplines 
our management team has an average of more than years of experience in the insurance industry and professions serving the insurance industry 
we establish performance expectations and measure performance of our management team consistent with a strategy for creating shareholder value 
pursue disciplined growth 
we believe that pursuing disciplined growth and expansion into new markets is critical to sustained profitability over the long term 
we systematically explore strategies for disciplined growth by our insurance and insurance management segments in the mpl insurance market on a continuous basis 
we believe that additional growth opportunities exist in our core markets  and that our market positions will allow us to continue to compete for quality business 
we also employ a systematic process to evaluate new markets based on a number of strategic considerations 
market conditions in our largest market  florida  have stabilized in terms of pricing 
we refer to this phase of the market cycle as the mature phase of the hard market conditions experienced over the past few years 
this phase is characterized by  among other things  pricing stability and a diminished desire of physicians to move their coverage to another insurer 
therefore  growth in florida may reasonably be expected to be more modest than in recent years 
our insurance management segment will continue its focus on capitalizing on growth in the physician and institutional markets in new york and pennsylvania  when such growth is deemed prudent 
maintain our financial strength 
we are committed to maintaining the strength and liquidity of our balance sheet by prudently managing our financial and operating leverage  conservatively investing our assets  stringently maintaining adequate reserves and capital and pursuing growth in a disciplined way 
in addition  we have a strong focus on measuring the key areas of our business and utilize enhanced financial and actuarial systems for the purpose of evaluating and controlling our business 
maintain disciplined underwriting and pricing 
in our insurance segment  we maintain a disciplined focus on selecting appropriate risks and pricing those risks in order to achieve our financial objectives  and we individually underwrite all of our insureds 
we believe that our extensive market knowledge provides us with a competitive advantage in establishing appropriate pricing and risk selection 
we underwrite and price risks based on a wide range of factors  with a particular focus on the professional s training  medical specialty  claims history and county or other geographic region of practice 
within our chosen markets  we do not manage our business to achieve specified market share goals 
rather  we seek to maximize our profitability by competing for quality business based on factors other than price alone 
form k aggressively manage loss costs through effective claims handling and risk management programs 
in addition to prudent risk selection  we manage our loss costs through effective claims handling 
we seek to minimize our incidence of claims by offering our insureds risk management programs that are designed to assist them in successfully managing their individual risk factors 
once claims are made  we seek to aggressively defend non meritorious claims and expeditiously settle meritorious claims in order to lower our overall loss costs 
as a result of this strategy  we settle fewer cases and take more cases to court 
our claims management philosophy includes a focus on reducing the number of claims settled with an indemnity payment and the employment of personnel with significant mpl claims experience and training 
we also utilize a select network of defense attorneys to assist us in executing our claims management philosophy 
industry overview the medical malpractice insurance market in the united states totaled billion in direct premiums written for the year ended december  this represents an increase of over the prior year according to the most recent data published by am best 
the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry  and of the mpl insurance sector  has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns characterized by periods of greater competition in pricing  underwriting terms and conditions a soft insurance market followed by periods of capacity shortage and lesser competition a hard insurance market 
we operated under soft market conditions during the latter part of the s 
beginning in  the mpl insurance sector began reporting higher loss costs on coverage written in prior years than had initially been established in loss reserves 
these increased loss costs  in certain cases  led to reduced capital to support current and future business and to downgrades in the financial strength ratings of a number of companies in the industry 
as a result  the market has seen significant withdrawal of capacity  including the departure of a number of firms that were market leaders at the time of their withdrawal 
many of the firms remaining in the market have responded by significantly raising premium rates  reducing or eliminating discounts and tightening underwriting terms and conditions 
prices for mpl insurance across the country have increased significantly since the onset of the hardening market 
medical professionals have responded to the hard market conditions  in some cases  by practicing without coverage  seeking to join with other practitioners to form self insured groups or purchasing lower limits of coverage 
for  we believe rate increases have moderated in the markets for our insurance products 
insurance ratings insurance specific ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies about the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet its insurance obligations 
these ratings are based on factors most relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and are not specifically directed toward the protection of investors 
they are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold a company s securities 
the significance of individual agencies and their ratings vary among different users 
they can be significant to investors and lenders  among other factors  as an indication of a company s suitability for investment or creditworthiness 
am best is our primary rating organization and is the only insurance rating agency that we have engaged to provide a rating on an interactive basis 
other organizations that rate us develop their ratings independently using publicly available data and without consulting with us 
these ratings are generally consumer oriented and involuntary on the part of the company being rated 
an insurance company s rating  and particularly its am best rating  is a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
in addition  certain independent agents and brokers may establish a minimum am best rating for participation in a potential market 
the significance of the am best rating to a given company varies depending upon the products involved  the customers and agents and competition and market conditions 
in addition  the significance of the am best rating may vary from state to state 
our insurance subsidiaries have a group rating from am best of b very good with a stable outlook  which is within the secure range of available ratings and represents the fifth highest of sixteen rating levels 
form k 
table of contents fpic insurance group  inc and subsidiaries insurance regulation each of the insurance subsidiaries we own or manage is regulated at the state level 
the state insurance departments of florida and missouri  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  and new york and pennsylvania  where the insurance companies we manage are domiciled  are the primary regulators 
our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulations in other states where they do business 
state insurance laws also regulate us as an insurance holding company 
our owned and managed insurance companies are required to register and furnish information about operations  management and financial condition to the florida  missouri  new york and other insurance departments 
the insurance departments periodically perform financial and market conduct examinations of the insurance companies and also require disclosure or approval of material transactions  such as dividends  above certain levels  from our insurance subsidiaries to the holding company 
all transactions within the holding company structure involving our insurance subsidiaries must also be fair and reasonable 
except as described below  florida insurance laws do not allow any person to acquire  directly or indirectly  five percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company without the prior written approval of the florida insurance department 
any purchaser of five percent or more of our common stock is presumed to have acquired a similar level of control of our insurance subsidiaries 
instead of obtaining prior approval  a purchaser of more than five percent  but not more than ten percent  of an insurance company may file a disclaimer of affiliation and control with the florida insurance department 
similar laws exist in missouri  except that the approval threshold is ten percent or more of a company s voting securities 
the primary purpose or mission of insurance regulation is the protection of policyholders 
state insurance laws generally delegate broad regulatory powers to insurance departments  including granting and revoking licenses  approving policy forms and premium rates  regulating trade practices  establishing minimum capital and surplus levels for companies  prescribing or permitting required statutory accounting and financial reporting rules  and prescribing the types and amounts of investments permitted 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports in each state in which they do business 
the financial statements contained in these reports are prepared using regulatory accounting principles  or statutory basis financial statements  as they are referred to in the insurance industry 
statutory accounting principles represent a comprehensive basis of accounting that is different from accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and so the accounting practices used by the insurance subsidiaries in their regulatory financial statements are different in certain material respects from the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles the naic codification 
the naic codification became applicable to all statutory basis financial statements issued after january  while the naic codification represents the official guidance on the statutory basis of accounting  the individual states and insurance departments continue to have the discretion to modify this guidance or establish their own statutory accounting principles for insurance companies 
insurance companies are also subject to assessments by state financial guaranty associations 
the primary purpose of these guaranty associations is to fund the unpaid claims and policyholder benefits of insolvent insurers 
generally  these associations assess member insurers on the basis of written premiums in their states 
medical malpractice policies are exempt from assessment by the florida hurricane catastrophe fund through may  form k tort reform some of the states in which we operate  notably florida  georgia and missouri  have passed tort reform as discussed below 
in general  we believe that these reforms may provide an additional level of stability  but their direct effect on our business is difficult to assess 
as with most new tort reforms  we expect some or all of them to be challenged in court in the coming years and since we cannot predict with any certainty how appellate courts will rule on these laws we do not take them into account in our rate making assumptions  except in florida where such credit is required by law 
during  the state of florida enacted legislation specifically directed at mpl insurance reforms 
the more significant aspects of this legislation included a  cap on non economic damages  subject to certain circumstances  and reforms to bad faith statutes with respect to mpl insurance claims 
the legislation also contained a requirement that insurers freeze their rates as of july   and file new rates or re file those rates for formal approval 
in addition  the legislation called for the state of florida to engage an outside actuarial consultant to estimate the benefits to be derived from the legislative reforms and a presumed factor for such benefit to be included in the rate filings to be made by the companies 
that presumed factor was a net reduction of approximately  of which the consultant attributed to the cap on non economic damages and to bad faith reforms 
in response to the reforms passed in in our largest market  florida  three constitutional amendments were added to the ballot in  and all were ultimately passed 
the first amendment  amendment  places limits on fees plaintiffs attorneys may collect in medical liability cases and could result in fewer malpractice claims being filed 
during december  the florida supreme court ordered the florida bar to draft a rule that establishes a procedure whereby a medical liability claimant may waive his or her right to a constitutionally mandated lower contingency fee 
a proposed rule was subsequently approved by the florida bar s board of governors  during february  that creates an affirmative obligation on the part of an attorney contemplating a contingency fee contract to notify a potential client with a medical liability claim of the limitations provided in that constitutional provision 
the rule allows the potential client to waive that right provided that the waiver is in writing and under oath using the form approved by the florida bar 
the second amendment  amendment  gives the public greater rights to view previously confidential state complaints filed against doctors and institutions  incident reports filed after medical errors  and documents from error reviews performed by hospitals 
opponents of the amendment argued that it could have a detrimental effect on peer review activities 
the third amendment  amendment  would take away the license of any physician who has three malpractice judgments or adverse findings  or strikes  by a licensing review organization 
fearing a strike  a physician could be pressed to demand settlements in malpractice cases  which could generate more lawsuits and drive up costs 
one or more of these amendments may be challenged in court or subject to further legislative interpretation 
we are unable to predict how such actions would ultimately be decided or how they would affect our business  if they occurred 
during the legislative session  the florida legislature passed bills addressing amendments and the bill for amendment specifies that the amendment only applies to records created  incidents occurring or actions arising after november  and only applies to records created within four years of the request 
the bill states that only a patient of the health care facility or provider may request records  and only records of the patient pertaining to the same or substantially similar condition  treatment or diagnosis may be obtained 
the bill reiterates that florida laws regarding peer review immunity and laws protecting those records against introduction in a civil proceeding are still in effect 
the bill for amendment clarified that the amendment cannot be applied retroactively and only incidents that occur after november  can be considered a strike 
the bill requires a standard of clear and convincing evidence  which is a much higher legal standard than that used in a civil case  which is a preponderance of the evidence or more likely than not  standard 
since the civil courts do not decide on a clear and convincing standard  the florida board of medicine will determine if a strike has occurred 
a single incident cannot count as more than one strike  regardless of the number of claimants or allegations of negligence 
settlements in disciplinary cases and in civil cases cannot be considered a strike 
form k 
table of contents fpic insurance group  inc and subsidiaries during february  georgia passed a comprehensive tort reform bill that became effective immediately upon passage 
the features of the bill that will most impact our business within the state are a  cap on non economic damages for all claimants seeking damages for injury or death of a single patient regardless of the number of physician defendants  the elimination of joint and several liability  and higher standards to qualify as an expert in a medical malpractice case 
the law also requires a clear and convincing evidence standard and a gross negligence burden of proof in cases involving emergency care  surgical care or obstetrical care  and a prohibition on venue shopping 
recent court decisions in georgia have declared the prohibition on venue shopping to be unconstitutional 
during march  missouri passed a comprehensive tort reform bill that became effective on august  the features of the bill that will most impact our business within the state are a  cap for non economic damages for all plaintiffs regardless of the number of defendants  the elimination of venue shopping and the elimination of joint and several liability for defendants found to be less than at fault
