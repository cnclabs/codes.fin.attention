item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in as the publisher of playboy magazine  we have become a world leader in the development and distribution of multimedia lifestyle entertainment for adult audiences 
today  our businesses are classified into three reportable segments entertainment  publishing and licensing 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the realignment of our existing online and entertainment segments into a combined entertainment group 
the new operating structure was designed to streamline operations  maximize return on content creation and increase responsiveness to customers 
prior periods have been restated to reflect the realignment of our reportable segments 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased the remaining minority interest in playboy 
com  inc  or playboy 
com  that we did not own 
subsequent to the repurchases  playboy 
com became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
revenues today we generate most of our entertainment group revenues from pay per view  or ppv  fees for our television network offerings  including playboy and spice branded domestic and international networks 
our network revenues are affected by marketing and retail price  which are controlled by the distributors  our revenue splits with distributors  which are negotiated  and the demand for our programming 
we believe television revenues will increasingly be generated from video on demand  or vod  and subscription video on demand  or svod  technologies 
internationally  we own and operate or license playboy  spice and locally branded television and movie networks  and we have equity interests in seven additional networks through joint ventures 
we also receive licensing fees from playboy websites and wireless providers outside of the united states 
subscription revenues are from multiple club websites  which offer unique content under the playboy  spice and other brand names 
e commerce revenues include the sale of our branded and other consumer products  both online and through direct mail 
we monetize online traffic via advertising and online gaming license fees 
entertainment group revenues also include the sale of dvds 
the majority of our publishing group revenues are derived from circulation  both subscription and newsstand sales  of playboy magazine and special editions 
additionally  the group generates sales from advertising in playboy magazine as well as from royalties on circulation and advertising from our licensed international editions 
our subscription revenues are fairly consistent  while newsstand sales are typically higher for issues containing celebrity pictorials or other special content  such as high profile articles or interviews 
the group s revenues fluctuate with the general condition of the local and national economies  which affect newsstand sales as well as advertising buying patterns 
licensing group revenues are principally generated from royalties received for the international and domestic licensing of our brands on consumer and entertainment products as well as from periodic auction sales of small portions of our art and memorabilia collection 
in the future  revenues will also be generated from location based entertainment projects 
costs and operating expenses entertainment group expenses include television programming amortization  online content  network distribution  hosting  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
trademark license and administrative fees to the parent company  which had been charged to the entertainment group for playboy 
com s use  will be eliminated in now that playboy 
com is a wholly owned subsidiary 
amortization and content expenses relate to the expenditures associated with the creation of playboy programming  the licensing of third party programming for our movie networks and the creation of content for our websites  wireless and satellite radio providers 
publishing group expenses include manufacturing  subscription promotion  editorial  shipping and administrative expenses 
manufacturing  which includes the production of the magazine  represents the largest cost of the group and fluctuates by issue due mainly to the cost of paper and the number of pages in the magazine 
licensing group expenses include agency fees  promotion  development and administrative expenses 
corporate administration and promotion expenses include general corporate costs such as technology  legal  security  human resources  finance  investor relations and communications  as well as company wide marketing and promotions  including expenses related to the playboy mansion

entertainment group the following discussion focuses on the revenue and profit contribution before programming amortization and online content expenses of each of our entertainment group businesses 
revenues from our domestic tv networks increased million  or  in direct to home  or dth  revenues increased million  or  primarily due to subscriber growth and an increase in average ppv buys 
the revenue increases were partially offset by decreased playboy tv cable ppv buys  as certain cable companies continue migrating consumers from linear channels to vod 
as a result of this transition to vod  revenues from playboy tv cable decreased million  or  in movie network revenues decreased million  or  primarily as a result of decreased ppv buys stemming from the transition to vod 
total vod revenues increased million  or  in the current year due to the continued roll out of vod service in additional cable systems as well as to a growing number of consumer buys in existing cable systems 
revenues associated with renting our studio facility and providing various related services to third parties increased million  or  in domestic tv network revenues were favorably impacted by the discontinuation of a distributor s high definition subscription service agreement  which resulted in the accelerated recognition of the remaining million of deferred revenue associated with the service agreement 
in  movie network revenues were impacted by a million unfavorable adjustment from an unanticipated retroactive rate reduction related to the earlier acquisition of one large mso by another 
profit contribution from domestic tv networks decreased million  or  for the year 
a million adjustment for a contractual obligation related to licensed programming combined with higher overhead costs related to the operation of our production facility more than offset the revenue increases described above 
international revenues increased million  or  in international television revenues increased million  or  in primarily due to increased revenues from several third party licensees and new networks in operation for a full year in australia and germany 
additionally  the launch of three dth channels in the uk contributed favorably to revenues 
international online and wireless revenues increased million  or  due to increased royalties from existing wireless partners and new license agreements 
profit contribution from our international entertainment businesses increased million  or  in due to the higher revenues mentioned above  partially offset by increased marketing and operating costs related to the newly launched channels 
domestic online subscription revenues increased million  or  in primarily due to the acquisition of an affiliate network of websites late in the year 
profit contribution increased million  or  as increased technology and marketing initiatives and expenses related to our newly acquired affiliate network of websites mostly offset the revenue increase 
e commerce revenues increased million  or  in as a result of a million payment we received related to the termination of a marketing alliance combined with increased catalog and business to business revenues 
e commerce profit contribution decreased million  or  as higher catalog production  marketing  product  and fulfillment expenses more than offset the revenue increase 
profit contribution from other businesses decreased million  or  in higher online advertising revenues and lower worldwide dvd cost of sales and marketing expenses were more than offset by a million favorable adjustment recorded in the prior year 
the group s administrative expenses decreased million  or  in primarily due to lower legal costs in the current year and a contractually obligated severance charge recorded in the prior year  partially offset by higher performance based compensation expense in the current year 
programming amortization and online content expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to the mix of programming 
we will continue to acquire and produce content that can be repurposed across our vod  online  wireless and satellite radio platforms 
we anticipate programming amortization expense to be approximately million and online content expense to be approximately million in  which could vary based on  among other things  the timing of completing productions 
as a result of the above  segment income for the group increased million  or  in compared to publishing group playboy magazine revenues decreased million  or  in advertising revenues decreased million due to fewer advertising pages and slightly lower net revenue per page 
newsstand revenues in were million lower principally due to fewer copies sold in the current year  partially offset by higher display costs in the prior year 
additionally  the current year included an unfavorable adjustment of million related to the prior year s issues compared to a million favorable adjustment in the prior year 
subscription revenues decreased million primarily due to lower average net revenue per copy  partially offset by an increase in the number of subscription copies served and lower bad debt expense in the current year 
higher favorable adjustments recorded in the prior year to recognize revenues for paid subscriptions that will not be served also contributed to the decrease in advertising sales for the first quarter magazine issues are closed  and we expect to report approximately lower advertising revenues and fewer advertising pages compared to the first quarter as the result of continuing softness in the market 
revenues from our other domestic publishing businesses decreased million  or 
this was primarily due to fewer newsstand copies of special editions sold in the current year combined with higher unfavorable adjustments to the prior year s issues in the current year  partially offset by higher display costs in the prior year 
international publishing revenues increased million  or 
the group s segment profitability decreased million in as a result of the lower revenues discussed above combined with higher paper costs of million and higher subscription acquisition expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in editorial content expenses in the current year 
we do not expect a material change in either the newsstand or advertising environments  and we expect a decline in profitability from our subscriptions business 
increased postage costs as well as the continued impact of paper price increases will have an unfavorable impact on results but will be mitigated by our decisions to reduce playboy magazine s circulation rate base effective with the january issue and increase the cover price by effective with the february issue 
we believe that the first quarter will be the worst for our publishing group in  and we will continue to work to meet our goal of lower losses in compared to licensing group licensing group revenues increased million  or  in primarily due to higher royalties from existing and new licensees in europe and asia 
the group s segment income increased million  or  due to the revenue increase  partially offset by higher revenue related expenses and development costs related to our location based entertainment business 
we are projecting growth in the licensing group s segment income because of the strength of the core licensing business 
corporate administration and promotion corporate administration and promotion expenses for increased million  or  largely due to an increase in performance based compensation and audit expenses  partially offset by the impact of a legal settlement in the prior year 
in  corporate administration and promotion expenses are expected to increase materially 
this is largely due to the previously mentioned minority interest repurchase  which resulted in the elimination of our intra company agreements related to trademark  content and administrative fees 
this will cause corporate administration and promotion expenses to increase by approximately million  with a corresponding improvement primarily in the entertainment group 
restructuring expenses in  we recorded an additional charge of million related to the restructuring plan as a result of changes in plan assumptions primarily related to excess office space

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to manage the risk associated with our exposure to such fluctuations  we enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we have derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  which are entered into in order to hedge the variability of cash flows to be received related to forecasted royalty payments denominated in the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge these royalties with forward contracts for periods not exceeding months 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
we link all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes

a portion of the net proceeds was used to complete a tender offer and consent solicitation for  and to purchase and retire all of the million outstanding principal amount of the senior secured notes 
the fair value of the million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes will be influenced by changes in market interest rates  the share price of our class b stock and our credit quality 
as of december   the convertible notes had an implied fair value of million 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a hypothetical devaluation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of the countries to which we have exposure  primarily japan and germany 
based on our sensitivity analyses at december  and  such a change in foreign currency exchange rates would affect our annual consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows by approximately million in each period
