item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is related to our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto beginning on f of this form k 
statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before item b above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting clinical testing 
in the course of almost three decades  we have established a strong foundation of laboratory  pre clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic diseases 
our strategy is to obtain the required regulatory approvals which will allow the progressive introduction of ampligen r our proprietary drug for treating myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs  hiv  hepatitis c hcv and hepatitis b hbv in the us  canada  europe and japan 
in  we completed a phase iii clinical trial in the us for use of ampligen r in treatment of me cfs and are in the process of assembling and analyzing the obtained data preparatory to completing and filing a new drug application with the fda 
we are also testing ampligen r in phase iib clinical trials in the us for the treatment of newly emerging multi drug resistant hiv  and for the induction of cell mediated immunity in hiv patients that are under control using potentially toxic drug cocktails 
our proprietary drug technology utilizes specifically configured ribonucleic acid rna and is protected by more than patents worldwide  with over additional patent applications pending to provide further proprietary protection in various international markets 
certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r alone and certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r in combination with certain other drugs 
some compositions of matter patents pertain to other new rna compounds  which have a similar mechanism of action 
in march we obtained from interferon sciences  inc isi all of its raw materials  work in progress and finished product alferon n injection r  together with a limited license to sell alferon n injection r  a natural alpha interferon that has been approved for commercial sale for the intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external condylomata acuminata genital warts in patients years of age or older in the united states 
in march  we acquired from isi the balance of isi s rights to its product as well as isi s production facility 
we are marketing the alferon n injection r in the united states through sales facilitated via third party agreements 
additionally  we intend to implement studies testing the efficacy of alferon n injection r in multiple sclerosis and other chronic viral diseases 
in this regard  the fda recently authorized a phase ii clinical study designed to investigate the activity and safety of alferon r ldo in early stage hiv positive patients 
we were incorporated in maryland in under the name hem research  inc  and originally served as a supplier of research support products 
our business was redirected in the early s to the development of nucleic acid pharmaceutical technology and the commercialization of rna drugs 
we were reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to hem pharmaceutical corp 
in and to hemispherx biopharma  inc  in june we have three domestic subsidiaries biopro corp  bioaegean corp  and core biotech corp  all of which are incorporated in delaware 
our foreign subsidiaries include hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa established in belgium in and hemispherx biopharma europe sa incorporated in luxembourg in restatements a on march   after doing additional analysis on guidelines set forth in eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  it was determined that the accounting treatment for the march  july  october  january and july debentures collectively  the debentures was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements for the quarters and years ended included in our annual report on form k for the years ended december  and  and for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june   september   march   june  and september   included within our quarterly reports on form q and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
in connection with the initial recording of the debentures mentioned above  it was originally determined that the discount related to the embedded conversion features and warrant issuances calculated at fair value was approximately     and  for the march  july  october  january and july debentures  respectively 
the discount derived from determining the fair value of the embedded conversion feature and warrant issuances is amortized to financing costs over the life of the debenture or charged to earnings on the earlier conversion thereof 
to properly account for the initial calculation of the discount  we determined  under guidance from eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  the debt discount should be restated for the march  july  october  january and july debentures to     and  respectively 
the total impact of this restatement on our statement of operations was to decrease the net loss for the year ended december  by  or per share and an increase in net loss of  or per share for the period ended december  b on march   it was determined that the accounting treatment for the investment banking fees paid to cardinal capital  llc cardinal in connection with the debenture issuances was inaccurately reflected in the financial statements for the quarters and years ended included in our annual report on form k for the years ended december  and  and for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june   september   march   june  and september   included within our quarterly reports on form q and that  therefore  a restatement of our financial statements for the periods referenced above was required 
in connection with the initial recording of the debentures mentioned above  it was originally determined that the fair value of the warrants issued as investment banking fees paid to cardinal securities  llc  be accounted for as a discount to the underlying debentures and be amortized over the life of the debenture or charged to earnings on the earlier conversion thereof 
these investment banking fees should have been capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized over the life of the debenture or charged to earnings on the earlier conversion thereof 
in addition  our calculation of the fair value of the warrants issued to cardinal as part of the debenture issuances as a discount to the debenture was determined to be overstated at the time of issuance

this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  reflects the changes for the annual results for the years ended december  and december  we will file our quarterly reports on form q a for the quarterly periods ended march   june   september   march   june  and september   as soon as practicable in connection with the restatements described above 
result of operations years ended december  vs 
net loss our net loss of  for the year ended december  was down compared to the same period in this reduction of  in loss was primarily due to lower costs associated with non cash financing charges related to our convertible debentures and related warrants 
these non cash financing costs were down  or of the change in net loss from period to period  production cost of goods sold expenditures were down  due to increased expenditures during associated with ramping up of the new brunswick facility for further production of alferon n injection r  and lower non cash stock compensation expenses of approximately  these lower expenses were slightly offset by an increase in research development r d costs during the current period of approximately  mainly due to costs associated with the transfer of our technology to hollister stier  our contract manufacturer of ampligen r  and costs related to the construction of our ampligen r raw material production line within our new jersey facility 
certain costs related to our exploratory drug  ampligen r  were expensed as r d costs 
net losses per share were 
for current period versus 
in the same period the lower stock compensation expense noted above resulted from having a limited number of shares of common stock authorized but not issued or reserved for issuance upon conversion or exercise of outstanding convertible and exercisable securities such as debentures  options and warrants prior to our annual meeting of stockholders in september prior to the meeting  to permit consummation of the sale of the july debentures and the related warrants  dr 
carter agreed that he would not exercise his warrants or options unless and until our stockholders approve an increase in our authorized shares of common stock 
for dr 
carter s waiver of his right to exercise certain options and warrants prior to approval of the increase in our authorized shares  we have agreed to compensate dr 
carter 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in alferon n injection r sales were down  or while ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  or 
the decline in alferon n injection r sales can be attributed to increased competition from rival products  specifically  m pharmaceutical s product aldera 
ampligen r sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
after screening the patient s enrollment records  we ship ampligen r to the physician 
a typical six month treatment therapy costs the patient about  for ampligen r 
this program has been in effect for many years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by me cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen r and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
production costs cost of goods sold our costs for production cost of goods sold were down  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  of this decrease in production costs is primarily due to expenses incurred in related to preparing the new brunswick facility for the production of alferon n injection r 
there were no such costs in we are nearing completion of the construction of the production line within our own facility in new brunswick for ampligen r raw materials 
we believe that this installation will increase production capacity  improve efficiency and assure compliance with worldwide drug manufacturing standards and processes 
alferon cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
since acquiring the right to manufacture and market alferon n injection r in march  we have converted the work in progress inventory into finished goods as needed 
this work in progress inventory included three production lots totaling the equivalent of approximately  vials doses at various stages of the manufacturing process 
approximately  vials have been produced 
our contractor  hospira completed the labeling and packaging of approximately  vials of alferon n injection r inventory and these vials were released into finished goods inventory in november hospira gave notice that they will no longer label and package alferon n injection r as they are seeking larger production runs for cost efficiency purposes 
we have identified two manufacturers to replace hospira and  on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection r 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
we have started preliminary work to convert the third lot of approximately  vials to finished goods inventory with an anticipated completion date for the third quarter by the first quarter  we anticipate preparing new alferon n injection r lots from blood leukocytes at our new jersey facility 
final formulation and packaging of alferon n injection r would be completed by a third party contractor as noted above 
the installation of a ampligen r raw material production line within our new brunswick facility should be completed and in production by may the transfer of ampligen r raw material production to our own facilities has obvious advantages with respect to overall control of the manufacturing process  keeping costs down and controlling regulatory compliance issues other parts of our  sq 
ft 
wholly owned fda approved facility are already in compliance for alferon n injection r manufacture 
this will also allow us to obtain ampligen r raw materials on a more consistent and reliable basis 
as of december   we have capitalized approximately  towards the construction and installation of this production line 
the anticipated completion date for the first lot of ampligen r raw material being produced is the second quarter we estimate the total cost of establishing this production line to be some  including modifications to our new brunswick facility 
this polymer production line will have the capacity to produce up to four kilograms per week  or kilograms per yeah which should allow us to manufacture up to one half million mg doses per year 
we have identified three contract manufacturers to expand polymer manufacture  if necessary  and obtained preliminary proposals from two and initiated discussions with the third 
research and development costs overall research and development direct costs for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
these costs in reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases and cancers as well as on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
in addition  these costs reflect direct costs incurred relating to the development of alferon r ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n  human leukocyte derived 
we have over approximately  doses on hand of alferon r ldo which have been prepared for use in clinical trials treating patients affected with the sars  avian flu or other potentially emerging infectious diseases 
during  we increased our clinical staff by employing several highly trained individuals to focus on the preparation of our ampligen r nda filing 
the nda filing is a very complex document and we are being meticulous in the preparation of the document 
our clinical monitors and research assistants completed the process of visiting the multiple clinical study sites around the country for our amp study in january our process included collecting and auditing data generated at each of these sites 
since we are now incorporating a larger sample of data from our previous trials for inclusion in the nda filing see below for further details  our clinical monitors and research assistants plan on visiting our sites associated with our amp study in with the intention of collecting and auditing this additional data 
all data must be reviewed and checked to clarify any inconsistencies or inaccuracies that turn up 
due to the human factor  these types of problems occur in all clinical trials 
these gaps and inconsistencies in data must be resolved with the respective clinical investigators  while maintaining a clear record of events which allows the fda to conduct a meaningful audit of these records 
we believe that our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in the treatment of me cfs is the most comprehensive study ever conducted in me cfs 
this phase iii clinical trial  which was conducted over a six year period  involved an enrollment of more than severely debilitated me cfs patients and was conducted at twelve medical centers throughout the united states 
the study is serving as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
we had originally targeted a late filing date for this nda for ampligen r 
in order to respond to recent changes in the regulatory environment that place a greater emphasis on the safety and efficacy of all new experimental drug candidates  we are now incorporating a larger sample of data from our previous trials 
the nda filing will now include data accumulated from  administrations of the studied drug to approximately me cfs patients 
we plan to complete and file the nda before year end the clinical development of the experimental therapeutic  ampligen r for me cfs was initiated approximately years ago 
to date federal health agencies have yet to reach a consensus regarding various aspects of me cfs  including parameters of promising therapies for me cfs and which aspects of me cfs are anticipated to be serious or life threatening 
over its developmental history  ampligen r has received various designations  including orphan drug product certification fda  emergency compassionate cost recovery sales authorization fda and promising clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports ahrq  agency health research quality 
however to date  the fda has determined it has yet to receive sufficient information to support the potential of ampligen r to treat a serious or life threatening aspect of me cfs 
the definition of the seriousness of a condition  according to guidance for industry documents published in july  is a matter of judgment  but generally based on its impact on such factors as survival  day to day functioning  or the likelihood that the disease  if left untreated  will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one 
the fda has recently requested a complete and audited report of the amp study to determine whether ampligen r has a clinically meaningful benefit on a serious or life threatening aspect of me cfs in order to evaluate whether the amp study results do or do not support a fast track designation 
the fda has also invited us to include a schedule for completion of all me cfs studies as well as a proposed schedule for our nda submission 
because we believe our me cfs studies are complete  we intend to request a pre nda meeting to obtain advice on preparing and submitting our nda 
at the same time we will continue with our existing ongoing efforts to prepare a complete and audited report of our various studies  including the well controlled amp study 
we are using our best efforts to complete the requisite reports including the hiring of new staff and various recognized expert medical regulatory consultants  but can provide no assurance as to whether the outcome of this large data collection and filing process approximately patients  treated more than  times will be favorable or unfavorable  specifically with respect to the fda s perspective 
we plan to use an independent contractor to file the nda electronically to facilitate the review by the fda 
also  we can provide no guidance as to the tentative date at which the compilation and filing of such data will be complete  as significant factors are outside our control including  without limitation  the ability and willingness of the independent clinical investigators to complete the requisite reports at an acceptable regulatory standard  the ability to collect overseas generated data  and the ability of hollister stier facilities or the facilities of such other manufacturer as we may retain in the event that we do not come to definitive terms with hollister stier to interface with our own new brunswick staff facilities to meet the manufacturing regulatory standards 
the timing of the fda review process of the nda is subject to the control of the fda and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our nda application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
our amp hiv study is a treatment using a strategic treatment interruption sti 
the patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen r is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen r therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen r  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen r therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
hiv patients have already participated in this week study 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  causing competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment competing for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial will be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
with the threat of an avian influenza pandemic rising and health officials warning that the virus could develop resistance to current flu treatments  the pursuit of a cost effective and complementary treatment to existing antivirals and vaccines has become critical 
this combination may permit the use of lower dosages and fewer injections of the antivirals and vaccines used to combat avian flu  thereby decreasing the cost of both immunization programs and treatment programs for the full blown disease 
in antimicrobial antibacterial therapy  which is the best studied clinical model  synergistic drug combinations may result in curative conditions outcomes  often not observed when the single drugs are given alone 
in the case of avian influenza where global drug supplies are presumptively in very limited supply relative to potential needs  therapeutic synergistic combinations could not only affect the disease outcome  but also the number of individuals able to access therapies 
in a recently reported study from a vaccine group in japan  the incorporation of poly i poly c dsrna into a nasal administration of a killed influenza a preparation converted a poorly immunogenic response into a highly efficacious vaccine in protection of mice from lethal infection from human influenza a 
ampligen r is a dsrna which currently is undergoing testing in the animal model 
recently  at the fourth annual biodefense research meeting of the american society of microbiology held in washington  dc  we presented results of laboratory testing that showed our two investigational immunotherapeutics  ampligen r and alferon r  are potentially useful against hn  or avian flu  virus 
the pre clinical research indicates that ampligen r  a specifically configured double stranded rna  can provide cross protection against avian flu viral mutations as well as boost the effectiveness of tamiflu and relenza  the only two drugs formally recognized for combating bird flu  up to times 
other lab tests  in healthy human volunteers  indicate that alferon r ldo low dose oral  a new delivery form of an anti viral with prior regulatory approval for a category of sexually transmitted diseases  can stimulate genes that induce the production of interferon and other immune compounds  key building blocks in the body s defense system 
the studies were conducted in conjunction with the national institute of infectious diseases of japan 
we have recently entered into an agreement with defence r d canada  suffield drdc suffield  an agency of the canadian department of national defence  to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of our experimental therapeutic ampligen r and alferon r for protection against human respiratory influenza virus infection in well validated animal models 
drdc suffield is conducting research and development of new drugs that could potentially become part of the arsenal of existing antiviral weapons to combat the bird flu 
the initial study will focus on the testing of potential drugs against the respiratory influenza virus infection on a mouse adapted strain of human influenza 
drdc suffield has already conducted extensive research in the use of liposome delivery technology to enhance the antiviral activity of a closely allied ampligen r analogue  poly iclc an immunomodulating dsrna which is very similar to ampligen r 
results suggest that ribo nucleic acid based drugs have the ability to elicit protective broad spectrum antiviral immunity against various pathogenic viruses 
hence  there is the potential for efficacy to be maintained against mutating strains of an influenza virus 
liposomes  a carrier system for nucleic acid based drugs  have shown an ability to protect these drugs against in vivo degradation  delivering them to intracellular sites of infection  thereby reducing any toxicity and prolonging their therapeutic effectiveness 
protection can be afforded for days with two doses of dsrna 
it is believed that in humans with active flu infection  tamiflu  given twice daily  may ameliorate symptoms 
a preclinical study was initiated in june  to determine if ampligen r enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza 
the preclinical study suggests a new  and potentially pivotal role of double stranded rna dsrna therapeutics in improving the efficacy of the present standards in care in both influenza prevention and treatment of acute disease 
the preclinical study is being conducted by research affiliates of the national institutes of health at utah state university to examine potential therapeutic synergies with different drug combinations 
the ongoing research is comparing the relative protection conveyed by tamiflu oseltamivir  roche and relenza zanamivir  glaxosmithkline with ampligen r dsrna  alone and in combination  against the avian flu virus hn 
cell destruction was measured in vitro using different drug combinations 
both drugs  given alone  were effective in inhibiting cell destruction by avian influenza  but viral suppression with the combination was greater than either drug alone 
the overall assessment is that there was improvement in cell protection when ampligen r was combined with oseltamivir carboxylate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza 
further immediate experimental tests are planned 
recently  japanese researchers journal of virology page  have found that dsrnas increase the effectiveness of influenza vaccine by more than and may also convey cross protection ability against variant viruses mutated strains of influenza virus 
in october  we signed a research agreement with the national institute of infectious diseases  in tokyo  japan 
the collaboration  by hideki hasegawa  md  md  chief of the laboratory of infectious disease pathology  will assess our experimental therapeutic ampligen r as a co administered immunotherapeutic to the institution s nasal flu vaccine 
in october  we also engaged the sage group  inc  a health care  technology oriented  strategy and transaction advisory firm  to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen r in treating chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs 
in the past year leaders in the japanese medical community have established the japanese society of the fatigue science and the osaka city university hospital opened the fatigue clinical center as the initial step in their fatigue research project 
a clinical study has been approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the kowloon west cluster at the princess margaret hospital in hong kong to evaluate the use of alferon r ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n  human leukocyte derived in normal volunteers and or asymptomatic subjects with exposure to a person known to have sars 
this study completed the dosing of ten patients during the fourth quarter and we expect to complete analyzing the results of this study in the coming months 
a clinical study to evaluate the use of alferon r ldo in hiv infected volunteers was initiated during the second quarter in philadelphia  pa 
the study is currently being conducted at two sites  drexel university and philadelphia fight  a comprehensive aids service organization providing primary care  consumer education  advocacy and research on potential treatments and vaccines 
the study is designed to determine whether alferon r ldo can resuscitate the broad spectrum antiviral and immunostimulatory genes 
the initial patient enrolled in this study in july and  as of december  seven patients have enrolled and completed dosing 
we are currently receiving data from this study and we are in the process of analyzing the results 
this trial methodology may have implications for treating other emerging viruses such as avian influenza bird flu 
present production methods for vaccines involve the use of millions of chicken eggs and would be slow to respond to an outbreak according to a recently convened world health organization expert panel in november health officials are also concerned that bird flu could mutate to cause the next pandemic and render present vaccines under development ineffective 
in september  we commenced a clinical trial using alferon n injection r to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
the infectious disease section of new york queens hospital and the weill medical college of cornell university are conducting this double blinded  placebo controlled trial 
this study plans to enroll patients as they become available 
as of march   nine patients have entered this study 
the cdc reports that  cases of west nile virus have been reported in the us as of january   including deaths 
we have completed the transfer and consolidation of our rockville quality assurance lab and equipment into our new brunswick facility 
we believe this newly consolidated lab will provide more efficiencies with regard to the quality assurance needs for both ampligen r and alferon n injection r 
in connection with settling various manufacturing infractions previously noted by the fda  schering entered into a consent decree with the fda whereby  among other things  it agreed to discontinue various contract third party manufacturing activities at various facilities including its san juan  puerto rico  plant 
ampligen r which was not involved in any of the cited infractions was produced at this puerto rico plant from year operating under instructions from the consent decree  schering has advised us that it would no longer manufacture ampligen r in this facility beyond and would assist us in an orderly transfer of said activities to other non schering facilities 
on december   we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen r for a five year term 
pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier will formulate and bottle the ampligen r 
we paid  as a deposit in order to initiate the manufacturing project 
this deposit was expended as research and development in the achievement of the initial objectives described in the agreement  in combination with our polymer production facility under construction in new brunswick  nj  may enable us to manufacture the raw materials for approximately  doses of ampligen r per week 
we executed a confidentiality agreement with hollister stier  therefore  we commenced the transfer of our manufacturing technology to hollister stier 
currently  hollister stier has completed two pilot manufacturing runs of ampligen r for stability testing 
we have identified two other cgmp production facilities in the united states capable of manufacturing ampligen r 
engagement of either of these facilities would provide back up to hollister stier and or provide additional production capacity if needed 
we are reviewing proposals from these production facilities and expect to act upon one or the other at the appropriate time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in g a expenses of  during this period is primarily due to a non cash stock compensation charge of  resulting from the issuance of  warrants to purchase common stock at per share to dr 
carter in that vested in the first quarter the warrants vested upon the second isi asset closing which occurred in march  higher professional fees  specifically legal costs  during  slightly offset this decrease in g a as we initiated legal proceedings seeking injunction relief and damages against conspiratorial group engaged in illegal activities to take over hemispherx and enrich themselves at the expense of our stockholders 
please see item legal proceedings in part i  above for more information 
interest and other income interest and other income for the three months ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income during the year can primarily be attributed to the maturing of marketable securities during the period 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
as described in note f to the accompanying financial statements  we have determined that all obligations under the mou with fujisawa have been fulfilled  therefore  other income of  has been recorded in this period 
interest expense and financing costs non cash financing costs and interest expenses were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  in charges for the same period a year ago 
non cash financing costs consist of the amortization of debenture closing costs  the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of costs associated with beneficial conversion features of our debentures and the fair value of the warrants relating to the debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
the main reason for the decrease in financing costs and interest expense of  or can be attributed to the aggregate total of these charges being reduced since due to decreased amortization charges as well as charges related to the conversion of debentures 
please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
years ended december  as restated vs 
as restated during the year ended december   we materially improved our cash position  completed the acquisition of our production facility in new brunswick  new jersey  as well as  acquired all of isi s rights to market alferon r n  completed drug dosing in our phase iii amp me cfs clinical trial and continued our efforts to develop ampligen r alferon r n 
our cash position improved as a result of placing january and july convertible debentures with an aggregate maturity value of  gross proceeds of  and the august private placement with select institutional investors of approximately  shares of our common stock and warrants producing  in gross proceeds 
completion of the drug dosing in the amp me cfs clinical trial in august allowed us to start the next step towards completing data collection and analysis 
net loss non cash charges materially affected our net losses for the years ended december  and our losses as restated  of  for the year ended december   include non cash financing charges of  and non cash charges of  for stock compensation expenses 
the losses for the same period  as restated  in of  included non cash financing charges of  this  increase in net operating losses reflects an increase of  in non cash finance charges   in research and development expenses and  in production cost of goods sold 
the increase in our research and development costs were the result of costs incurred in the development of a more efficient bottling manufacturing process for alferon n injection r  vials abstracted from the third lot of alferon n injection r inventory for research and development purposes  and costs associated with using alferon n injection r in a clinical trial to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
our production cost cost of goods sold increased due to higher alferon n injection r sales  costs related to preparing our new brunswick  nj facility for the installation of the lab now located in rockville  md  and expanding production at our new brunswick facility to include ampligen r raw material 
the  for stock compensation expense primarily consisted of  resulting from warrants issued to dr 
carter in that vested in the first quarter these warrants vested upon the second isi asset closing which occurred on march  revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in revenues for the year ended december  from sales of alferon r n totaled  versus  for the period of march   the date we acquired the rights to the alferon r n business from isi  through december  sales of alferon r n are anticipated to increase as we have more product available and intend to expand our marketing sales programs on an international basis 
revenues from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a week treatment program 
we executed a memorandum of understanding mou in january with astellas pharma astellas  formally fujisawa deutschland gmbh  a major pharmaceutical corporation  granting them an exclusive option for a limited number of months to enter a sales and distribution agreement with exclusive rights to market ampligen r for me cfs in germany  austria and switzerland 
the mou required us to file the full report on the results of our amp clinical trial with astellas by may  if the full report was not provided to astellas by may  and astellas did not wish to exercise its option  we would have been required to refund one half of the  euro fee 
we submitted our initial report to astellas on may  and responded to subsequent inquiries for additional information 
the option period ends weeks after the later of astellas s review of the full report on the results of our amp clinical trial and astellas s meeting with three of the trial s principal investigators 
we received an initial fee of  euros approximately  us 
if we did not provide them with the full report by december  and astellas did not wish to exercise its option  we would be required to refund the entire fee 
on november   we and fuji terminated the mou by mutual agreement 
we did not agree on the process to be utilized in certain european territories for obtaining commercial approval for the sale of ampligen r in the treatment of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome cfs 
instead of a centralized procedure  and in order to obtain an earlier commercial approval of ampligen r in europe  we have determined to follow a decentralized filing procedure which was not anticipated in the mou 
we believe that it now is in the best interest of our stockholders to potentially accelerate entry into selected european markets whereas the original mou specified a centralized registration procedure 
pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties we refunded  euros to astellas 
we have recorded the remaining  euros as an accrued liability as of december  we are currently holding the  euros pending further developments in accordance with the mutually agreed upon termination with astellas 
the company has determined that all obligations under the mou with astella s have been fulfilled and  therefore   was recorded in september as other income 
production costs cost of goods sold production costs for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
these costs reflect approximately  for the cost of sales of alferon n injection r for the year ended december  in addition  costs of sales for alferon n injection r for the period march  acquisition date of inventory from isi through december  amounted to  the remaining production costs in represent expenditures associated with preparing the new brunswick facility for the installation of the lab now located in rockville  md and for further production of alferon n injection r and ampligen r raw materials 
in august  we released most of the second lot of product approximately  vials to abbott laboratories for bottling and realized approximately  vials of alferon r n 
some  of the remaining vials within this lot were held back to be utilized in the development of a more compatible vial size for manufacturing of alferon n injection r 
our production and quality control personnel in our new brunswick  nj facility are involved in the extensive process of manufacturing and validation required by the fda 
research and development costs overall research and development direct costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  during the same period a year earlier 
these costs primarily reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases and cancers as well as on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
the primary reasons for the increase in research and development costs of  for the year ended december  versus the same period a year ago were primarily due to costs incurred in the development of a more efficient bottling manufacturing process for alferon n injection r  vials abstracted from the third lot of alferon n injection r inventory for research and development purposes  and costs associated with using alferon n injection r in a clinical trial to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
in we completed the double blind segment of our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in the treatment of me cfs 
clinical data on the primary endpoint exercise treadmill duration was presented at the th international conference on anti viral research in tucson  az on may  the data showed that patients receiving ampligen r for weeks improved exercise treadmill performance by a medically and statistically significant amount compared to the placebo group 
new data was presented at the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy on increases in exercise capacity with ampligen r and placebo which were correlated with an improved ability to utilize oxygen  so called  maximum oxygen consumption or vomax 
vomax has been previously shown by others to be decreased with individuals with cfs 
an abnormal exercise stress test  including a low vomax  could help qualify cfs patients for disability under social security administration rules 
additional data on subset analyses showed that both stratification cohorts those with baseline exercise treadmill duration greater than or less than nine minutes improved exercise capacity by over  an amount considered medically significant in other chronic diseases 
ampligen r is in two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv to overcome multi drug resistance  virus mutation and toxicity associated with current haart therapies 
one study  the amp  is a salvage therapy  conducted in the us and evaluating the potential synergistic efficacy of ampligen r in multi drug resistant hiv patients for immune enhancement 
the second study  the amp  is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of ampligen r under strategic treatment intervention and is also conducted in the us enrollment in the amp study is presently on hold as we focus our efforts on the amp study 
me cfs over patients have participated in our me cfs phase iii clinical trial 
in august  the remaining patients completed drug dosing in the open label segment stage ii of this phase iii protocol 
we completed the randomized placebo controlled phase stage i of this study in february and have started final data collection for the data analysis 
this process includes validation and quality assurance and should be completed by early as with any experimental drug being tested for use in treating human diseases  the fda must approve the testing and clinical protocols employed and must render their decision based on the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested 
historically this is a long and costly process 
our me cfs amp clinical study is a phase iii study  which based on favorable results  will serve as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
the fda review process could take months and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  required more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
hiv the amp hiv study is a treatment using a strategic treatment interruption sti 
the patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen r is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
ampligen r is an experimental immunotherapeutic designed to display both antiviral and immune enhancing characteristics 
prolonged use of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has been associated with long term  potentially fatal  toxicities 
the clinical study amp is designed to address these issues by evaluating the administration of our lead experimental agent  ampligen r  a double stranded rna drug acting potentially both as an immunomodulator and antiviral 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen r therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen r  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen r therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
as more patients are enrolled  the related clinical costs will continue to increase with some offset to our overall expenses due to the diminishing cost of the me cfs clinical trial 
it is difficult to estimate the duration or projected costs of these two clinical trials due to the many variables involved  ie patient drop out rate  recruitment of clinical investigators  etc 
the length of the study and costs related to our clinical trials cannot be determined at this time as such will be materially influenced by a the number of clinical investigators needed to recruit and treat the required number of patients  b the rate of accrual of patients and c the retention of patients in the studies and their adherence to the study protocol requirements 
under optimal conditions  the cost of completing the studies could be approximately to million 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  as there is competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment compete for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we will complete this trial and or obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
in september  we commenced a clinical trial using alferon n injection r to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
the infectious disease section of new york queens hospital and the weill medical college of cornell university will be conducting this double blinded  placebo controlled trial 
during  over  human cases of west nile virus were reported in states 
manufacturing in order to obtain ampligen r raw materials of higher quality gmp certified and on a more regular production basis  we have implemented consolidation and transfer of relevant manufacturing operations into our new brunswick  new jersey facility 
this consolidation and transfer of manufacturing operations has been implemented as a recent inspection of the ribotech facility in south africa  our previous supplier of ampligen r raw materials  indicated that it did not  at present  meet the necessary gmp standards for a fully certified commercial process 
the transfer of ampligen r raw materials manufacture to our own facilities  while having obvious advantages with respect to regulatory compliance other parts of the  sq 
ft 
wholly owned facility are already in compliance for alferon r n manufacture  may delay certain steps in the commercialization process  specifically a targeted nda filing 
in connection with settling various manufacturing infractions previously noted by the fda  schering entered into a consent decree with the fda whereby  among other things  it agreed to discontinue various contract third party manufacturing activities at various facilities including its san juan  puerto rico  plant 
ampligen r which was not involved in any of the cited infractions was produced at this puerto rico plant from year operating under instructions from the consent decree  schering has recently advised us that it would no longer manufacture ampligen r in this facility at the end of the applicable term which is th quarter and would assist us in an orderly transfer of said activities to other non schering facilities 
on december   we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington hollister stier  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen r for a five year term 
pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier will formulate and bottle the ampligen r 
in november  we paid a  deposit upon executing the agreement in order to initiate the manufacturing project 
we recorded this payment as a research and development cost in the achievement of the initial objectives described in the agreement  in combination with our polymer production facility under construction in new brunswick  nj  may enable us to manufacture the raw materials for approximately  doses of ampligen r per week 
we executed a confidentiality agreement with hollister stier  therefore  we commenced the transfer of our manufacturing technology to hollister stier 
currently  hollister stier has completed two pilot manufacturing runs of ampligen r for stability testing 
we have identified two other cgmp production facilities in the united states capable of manufacturing ampligen r 
engagement of either of these facilities would provide back up to hollister stier and or provide additional production capacity if needed 
we are reviewing proposals from these production facilities and expect to act upon one or the other at the appropriate time 
the purified drug concentrate utilized in the formulation of alferon n injection r is manufactured in our new brunswick  new jersey facility and alferon n injection r was formulated and packaged at a production facility formerly owned and operated by abbott laboratories located in kansas 
abbott laboratories has sold the facility to hospira 
hospira recently completed the production of  vials 
hospira is ceasing the labeling and packaging of alferon n injection r as they are seeking larger production runs for cost efficiency purposes 
we have identified two manufacturers and  on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection r 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in g a expenses of  during this period is primarily due to non cash charges of  for stock compensation expenses in these stock compensation charges consisted of  resulting from warrants issued to dr 
carter in that vested in and directors fees paid in of  the warrants noted above vested upon the second isi asset closing which occurred on march  in addition  investment banking fees relating to assistance in financing matters increased in as compared to a period early by approximately  these increases were offset by a decrease in service fees in of approximately  as compared to a year earlier 
these services fees related to the acquisition of isi 
impairment loss during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix 
this impairment reduces our carrying value to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on its then proposed investment offerings 
other income expense interest and other income for the year ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and financing costs  as restated  were  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
non cash financing costs consist of the amortization of debenture closing costs  the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of costs associated with beneficial conversion features of our debentures and the fair value of the warrants relating to the debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  amounted to  substantially from proceeds from the sale of common stock 
as of december   and march  we had approximately  and  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively 
these funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements including debt service for the near term 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen r products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved

in addition  in the event that we do not pay the redemption price at maturity  the debenture holders  at their option  may convert the balance due at the lower of a the conversion price then in effect and b of the lowest closing sale price of our common stock during the three trading days ending on and including the conversion date

notwithstanding the foregoing  the exercise prices as reset or adjusted for anti dilution  will in no event be less than per share 
upon completion of the august private placement see note  the exercise price was lowered to per share 
in  as restated  and  we recorded an additional charge to financing costs of  and  respectively  to account for the reset of the exercise price of the july warrants to per share

in consideration for extending the maturity date of the outstanding debentures  we issued an aggregate of  warrants the october warrants to the debenture holders to acquire common stock at a price of per share at any time from october  through october  the october warrants contain provisions for adjustment of the exercised price in the event of certain anti dilution events 
we agreed to register of the shares issuable as interest shares that might result due to the amendments to the debentures and issuable upon exercise of the october warrants 
the above transaction and amendment to the existing terms of the above mentioned debentures would fall under eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
this eitf discussed and reached a consensus that a substantial modification of terms should be accounted for  and reported in the same manner as  an extinguishment 
any modification of a debt instrument between a debtor and creditor in a non troubled debt situation is deemed to be a substantial modification in the event the present value of the cash flows under the new terms of the new debt instrument is at least percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument 
in the event the cash flow effect of the present value basis is less than percent  the debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different 
the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of the cash flows is the effective interest rate of the original debt instrument 
accordingly  we have treated the change in terms to the original debentures as non substantial in nature and have not accounted for such modification as an extinguishment of debt  but rather a debt modification 
in addition  the  warrants issued to the debenture holders as consideration for extending the maturity date were valued using the black scholes method was  and recorded as additional debt discount on the july debenture 
the discount will be amortized as interest expense over the new term of the debt instrument 
any costs incurred by third parties were expensed as incurred

see below for the accounting effect on this matter 
taken separately  the march  july  october and january debenture transactions do not trigger section however  the amex took the position that these transactions should be aggregated and  as such  stockholder approval was required for the issuance of common stock for a portion of the potential exercise of the warrants and conversion of the debentures in connection with the january debentures

any adjustment to the debenture discount will be amortized over the remaining life of the debentures

in our discretion  we may elect to sell less common stock to fusion capital than the daily amount and we may increase the daily amount as the market price of our stock increases 
the purchase price of the shares of common stock will be equal to a price based upon the future market price of the common stock without any fixed discount to the market price 
fusion capital does not have the right or the obligation to purchase shares of our common stock in the event that the price of the common stock is less than 
since we initially registered  shares purchasable by fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement  the selling price of our common stock to fusion capital will have to average at least per share for us to receive the maximum proceeds of million without registering additional shares of common stock 
as of march   we need an average selling price of per share for the remainder of the agreement to realize the  in proceeds 
the closing price of our stock was on march  pursuant to our agreement with fusion capital  we registered for public sale by fusion capital up to  shares of our common stock 
however  in the event that we decide to issue more than  ie greater than of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the date of the agreement  we would first seek stockholder approval in order to be in compliance with american stock exchange rules

revised  share based payment sfas r 
on april   the securities and exchange commission issued an amendment to rule of regulation s x that allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period that begins after june  as originally required 
accordingly  we will adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date base on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in addition  we expect to continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model  which is an acceptable option valuation model in accordance with sfas r  to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees 
beyond those restricted stock and stock option awards previously granted  we cannot predict with certainty the impact of sfas r on its future consolidated financial statements as the type and amount of such awards are determined on an annual basis and encompass a potentially wide range depending upon the compensation decisions made by the human resources committee of our board of directors 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as currently required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
this requirement  to the extent it exists  will decrease net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods subsequent to adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which expresses the view of the sec staff regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements 
we believe that the views provided in sab are consistent with the approach taken in the valuation and accounting associated with share based compensation issued in prior periods as well as those issued during in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in eitf issue accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  which retains the exception in paragraph of eitf issue no 
for conventional debt instruments 
those instruments in which the holder has an option to convert the instrument into a fixed number of shares or a corresponding amount of cash at the issuer s discretion and its ability to exercise the option is based on either a the passage of time or b a contingent event  should be considered conventional for purposes of applying that exception 
the consensus should be applied on a prospective basis for new or modified instruments starting from the third quarter of the adoption of eitf no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
when there is a modification of a convertible debt instrument  the change in the fair value of an embedded conversion option should be included in the analysis of determining whether a debt extinguishment has occurred 
the change in the fair value of the embedded conversion option is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the modification 
also  when a modification of a convertible debt instrument occurs  the change in the fair value of the embedded conversion prior should be recognized as a discount or premium with a corresponding increase or decrease in additional paid in capital 
lastly  a beneficial feature should not be recognized or reassessed upon modification of a convertible debt instrument 
the adoption of eitf no
