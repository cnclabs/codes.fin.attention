item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of radio frequency integrated circuits rfic and radio frequency rf front end solutions in the rapidly growing wireless handset and broadband communications markets 
our products include power amplifiers pas  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as integrated rf modules 
in the wireless handset market  we focus on rfic and rf front end solutions for wireless handsets operating over various air interface standards 
in the broadband market  our focus is on applications for wireless local area networking wlan systems  cable set top boxes  cable television infrastructure systems  worldwide interoperability for microwave access wimax systems and fiber to the premises fttp communications systems 
our integrated solutions enable our customers to improve rf performance  power efficiency  reliability and time to market  while reducing the size  weight and cost of their products 
we have longstanding customer relationships with several of the industry leaders in their respective markets  including lg electronics inc lg electronics  samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung  kyocera corporation kyocera and research in motion limited rim in the wireless handset market  intel corporation intel in the wlan market  and scientific atlanta  inc scientific atlanta and motorola  inc motorola in the cable set top box and cable infrastructure markets 
additionally  in the wireless arena  we have been included in reference designs of industry leaders such as qualcomm incorporated qualcomm  texas instruments incorporated texas instruments  broadcom corporation broadcom and atheros communications  inc atheros 
we continue to focus on leveraging our technological and manufacturing advantages to remain a leading supplier of rfics and rf front end solutions 
we believe our proprietary ingap plus tm technology  which combines the bipolar technology of a pa hbt pa with the surface device technology of an rf active switch phemt on the same die  provides us with a competitive advantage in the market place 
our primary fab  a state of the art six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since unlike traditional cmos silicon fabs that have short technology lifecycles and require frequent capital investments  gaas fabs are more similar to analog fabs that have long lifecycles and do not become quickly outdated 
we believe that this facility will enable us to capitalize on the growing demand for rfics 
our six inch wafer fab allows us to produce more than twice the rf die per wafer compared with the four inch wafer fabs still used by some of our competitors 
we believe our strong fabrication capability and available capacity  combined with integrated product design and logistics expertise  allow us to quickly develop and manufacture products to meet market and customer requirements 
we have fixed expenses particularly relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead 
accordingly  decreases in unit volume throughput result in our fixed production costs increasing as a percentage of revenue  which adversely affects our gross margin and profitability 
we will continue to invest in selected strategic research and development programs to maintain our competitive position 
we experienced net sales growth in primarily due to increased demand for our broadband products  including our wlan  cable set top box and cable television infrastructure products 
we also experienced increased demand for our wireless products including our rf modules for wireless handsets 
in  the growth in our wireless market was less than the growth in our broadband market 
we continued to experience net sales growth in resulting from the increased demand for our wireless products  particularly our pas used in wireless handsets and other handheld devices 
broadband product net sales growth continued as demand increased for our wlan pas  and tuner integrated circuits and active splitters for our catv markets 
we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive  which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales and therefore cause continued fluctuations in our profitability 
as a result of the ongoing market shift to newer and smaller rf modules  average selling prices may continue to decrease  which could adversely affect our gross margin and profitability 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the title  risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer  price and terms are fixed  no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we sell to certain distributors who are granted rights of return and exchange and certain price protection 
revenue is not recognized for the portion of shipments subject to return  exchange or price protection until such rights expire 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
cancellation revenue is recognized when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold during the year 
the accrued liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
goodwill and intangibles impairment we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
significant judgements are involved in the determination of the estimated useful lives for our other intangibles and whether the goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations or expected to be disposed of when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets is less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
at december   two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
for the years ended december   and  we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions  including option term until exercise and future stock price volatility 
if the fair value method were used  basic and diluted loss per share for fiscal  and would have been  and  as compared to reported basic and diluted loss per share of  and  respectively 
effective january   we will be required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted

results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges purchased in process r d operating loss interest income interest expense gain on repurchase of convertible notes other income loss before income taxes benefit from income taxes net loss compared to net sales 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million for the increase in net sales of million was primarily due to i an increase of million in our sales of gsm pa products used in wireless handsets  ii an increase of million in our sales of wlan pas used in the network computer market and iii an increase of million in our sales of tuner and active splitter products used in the cable set top box market 
partially offsetting these increases were i a decrease of million in our sales of cdma pas and ii a decrease of million in our sales of switch products used in wireless handsets 
the decline in net sales of cdma pas was primarily due to a transition in to lower priced next generation pa modules and declines in average selling prices 
the decline in net sales of switch products was primarily due to our decision to reduce our research and development expenditures in this product line 
specifically  net sales in of our wireless products increased to million compared to million for net sales in of our broadband products increased to million compared to million in gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year

activity and liability balances related to the restructuring and other charges for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions lease related year ended december  beginning balance deductions december  restructuring balance year ended december  deductions savings on settlement of obligation december  restructuring balance interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was due to higher average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in interest expense arises from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in notes and our convertible senior notes due in notes 
in september  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our notes and consequently reduced the outstanding principal balance to million  and concurrently issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
gain on repurchase of convertible notes 
during  we recognized a gain of million  on the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our notes  after adjusting for accrued interest and the write off of a proportionate share of unamortized offering costs 
benefit from income taxes 
in and  the company received no benefit from income taxes and recorded a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax balance 
compared to net sales 
net sales during increased to million  compared to million for the net sales improvement was primarily due to an increase in demand for broadband products  particularly wlan pas used in wireless personal computer access and rfics used in both cable subscriber and infrastructure applications and the remainder to demand for our gsm pas used in wireless handsets and hand held devices 
sales during of rfics used for broadband applications increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased volumes of our pas used for wlan applications and products used for both cable and subscriber and infrastructure applications 
specifically  net sales of rfics used for cellular and pcs applications increased during to million from million in the increase was due to our expanded product presence and volumes for our gsm pas 
generally  selling prices for same product sales were lower during as compared to gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin from the prior year is the result of the increase in net sales  improved production throughput in our facilities  lower depreciation expense and lower product costs 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during primarily due to the incremental year over year operating costs of the company s acquisitions of rf solutions rfs and tavanza 
purchased in process r d 
in  the company expensed purchased in process research and development costs of million resulting from the acquisitions of rfs and tavanza 
the charge represented the fair value of certain acquired research and development projects that were determined to have not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses 
no acquisitions or in process r d applied in selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and sales related costs associated with our sales expansion efforts  including application centers in taiwan and south korea 
restructuring and other charges 
during  we recorded charges of million for restructuring and other charges related to severance and related employee benefits in connection with workforce reductions of approximately operations and administrative positions and lease related costs 
activity and liability balances related to the restructuring and other charges for the years ended december  and are as follows in millions lease related workforce reductions total year ended december  beginning balance restructuring and other expenses deductions december  restructuring balance year ended december  deductions december  restructuring balance interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was due to lower average invested funds and was compounded by lower interest rates

liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
we had million aggregate principal amount of our notes and million aggregate principal amount of our notes outstanding as of december  operations required the use of million in cash during investing activities provided million of cash during  consisting principally of net sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of equipment of million 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily consisting of proceeds received from employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan esp plan of million and million  respectively  partially offset by our repurchase of shares of common stock for million 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for the next twelve months including the repayment of our debt principal obligation due in november of our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our outstanding debt or equity 
we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our million in outstanding convertible senior unsecured notes  million of which are due in november of and the remainder of which are due in october of  and our other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance 
the table below summarizes required cash payments as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt  including short term portion plus the interest payable with respect thereto operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
fas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  fas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company currently believes that the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r fas r  share based payment  amending fas and requiring that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas  however  pro forma footnote disclosure will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in april  the sec deferred the implementation date of fas r 
as a result  the company will adopt fas r effective january  rather than the initial implementation date of july   using the modified prospective transition method described in fas r 
under this method  the company is required to recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period for all awards that remain unvested as of january  as permitted by fas  prior to january   the company accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options or its esp plan 
the company believes based on the level of share based payments previously granted and unvested and esp plan participation  that the adoption of fas r will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the level of future equity based compensation grants and esp plan participation could have a material effect on amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
on december   the company authorized an immediate vesting of eligible employees unvested share options with an exercise price greater than per share 
directors were not eligible 
in total  million options with an average exercise price of immediately vested and have an average remaining contractual life of years 
the unamortized fair value associated with these accelerated vest shares of approximately million amortized immediately 
in addition to its employee retention value  the company s decision to accelerate the vesting of these out of the money options was based upon the accounting of such costs moving from disclosure only in to being included in the company s statement of operations in based upon the company s expected adoption of fas r prior to its required adoption date being deferred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and federal  state  municipal  and agency securities 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated rate by expected maturity value fair value s total s principal weighted average stated rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have purchased some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  we invest some of our cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
each of our notes and notes are convertible notes that bear a fixed rate of interest of 
a change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact fair value but not earnings or cash flow because the interest rate is fixed 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding convertible notes  estimated based upon dealer quotes  was approximately million
