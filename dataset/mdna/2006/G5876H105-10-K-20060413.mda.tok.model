item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed under item a risk factors 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading global semiconductor provider of high performance analog  mixed signal  digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits 
our diverse product portfolio includes switching  transceiver  wireless  pc connectivity  gateways  communications controller and storage and power management solutions that serve diverse applications used in business enterprises  consumer electronics and emerging markets 
we are a fabless integrated circuit company  which means that we rely on independent  third party contractors to perform manufacturing  assembly and test functions 
this approach allows us to focus on designing  developing and marketing our products and significantly reduces the amount of capital we need to invest in manufacturing products 
in january  we acquired galileo technology ltd 
now marvell semiconductor israel ltd  or msil in a stock for stock transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately billion 
msil develops high performance internetworking and switching products for the broadband communications market 
in june  we acquired radlan computer communications ltd 
radlan  a leading provider of embedded networking software  for aggregate consideration to date of approximately million 
in november  we acquired the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation for approximately million 
the acquired business designs and supplies controller chips for data storage peripherals  such as hard disk and tape drives 
in february  we acquired the semiconductor design business of utstarcom  inc for million 
the semiconductor design business of utstarcom designs and supplies chipsets for cellular phone applications 
in february  we entered into an agreement to acquire the printer semiconductor business of avago technologies limited for million and potential additional earnout payments 
we offer our customers a wide range of high performance analog  mixed signal  digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits 
our products can be utilized in a wide array of enterprise applications including hard disk drives  high speed networking equipment  pcs  wlan solutions for soho and residential gateway solutions  and consumer applications such as cell phones  printers  digital cameras  mp devices  speakers  game consoles and pdas 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four significant customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to three significant customers each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to two significant customers each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
also  in fiscal  and  one distributor accounted for  and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales is made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
sales to customers in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue for the years ended january   and  respectively 
because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in asia  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region 
substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures 
we expect to increase our research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenditures as we seek to expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
for the past four years  we have been able to report significant sequential quarterly growth in revenues  however  our revenues have grown at a slower sequential rate since the third quarter of fiscal compared to the double digit sequential growth rate of the previous eleven quarters 
this slower growth rate is due  among other things  to the larger base of revenue and market share we now enjoy  which makes continuation of double digit revenue growth on a sequential quarterly basis unlikely in the current market 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january in a week year  each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
the additional week in a week year is added to the fourth quarter  making such quarter consist of weeks 
fiscal years  and were comprised of weeks 
for presentation purposes  our financial statements and notes and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to january as our year end 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
however  some of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and rights of return on product unsold by the distributors 
product revenue on sales made through distributors with rights of return is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
revenue from licensed software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided that the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from post contract customer support and any other future deliverables is deferred and earned over the support period or as contract elements are delivered 
in arrangements that include a combination of our hardware and our software products that are also sold separately  where software is more than incidental and essential to the functionality of the product being sold  we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  accounts for the entire arrangement as a sale of software and software related items and follows the revenue recognition criteria in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables apply to sales arrangements with multiple arrangements that include a combination of hardware  software and or services 
for multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on fair value 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
undelivered elements typically are software warranty and maintenance services 
additionally  collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms substantially greater than our normal payment terms 
revenue on such sales is deferred and recognized as revenue as the payments become due 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
our provision for estimated price protection  sales returns and allowances on product sales is recorded in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if actual price protection granted to distributors or product returns exceeds our estimates  additional reductions of revenue would result 
our total allowance for sales returns was million and million as of january  and  respectively 
actual future returns could be different than the returns allowance established 
we also enter into development agreements with some of our customers 
development revenue is recognized under the proportionate performance method  with the associated costs included in research and development expense 
we estimate the proportionate performance of our development contracts based on an analysis of progress toward completion 
accounting for income taxes 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining current and long term tax payable  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets as of january   due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize some of our deferred tax assets before the underlying tax attributes expire primarily related to our ability to utilize research and development tax credits 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal to provide for taxation in these jurisdictions 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal  our german and israel subsidiaries underwent and completed corporate tax audits of years through and years through  respectively 
during fiscal  the internal revenue service irs completed an income tax audit for the fiscal years ended january   and of our us consolidated returns 
the audits closed with no material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowances 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the realization of our accounts receivable and our results of operations 
the accounts receivable allowance recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of january  is million 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross margin at the time the related inventory is sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we are also required to perform annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and v a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between net book values of the asset and its estimated fair value 
the annual impairment test required under sfas was completed in the fourth quarter and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
we intend to continue to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future  which may adversely impact gross margins 
we are aggressively defending these litigation matters and believe no material adverse outcome will result 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in certain companies 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  is million 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended january  net revenue operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and other acquired in process research and development facilities consolidation charge total operating costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended january  and net revenue years ended january  change in net revenue net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our storage socs which increased by million  wireless products which increased by million and system controllers which increased by million 
the increases in net revenue are primarily due to increased acceptance of our storage soc products by hard disk drive manufacturers  increased market share gains in the pc desktop and consumer product markets with our storage soc products and volume shipments of our wireless products and system controllers from new design wins 
revenue from storage products was  million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from storage products is primarily attributable to an increase in volume shipments of our storage socs 
revenue from communication products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from communication products is primarily due to an increase in shipments of wireless products and system controllers 
net revenue derived from development contracts decreased in fiscal in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal  and represented less than of net revenue for each year 
we expect that revenue for fiscal will increase from the level of revenue we reported in fiscal due to increases in shipments of our storage socs into the pc desktop and consumer product markets and increased adoption of our storage products in emerging consumer storage electronics 
also  we expect additional growth in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in shipments of our wireless products from new design wins 
cost of goods sold years ended january  change in cost of goods sold of net revenue gross margin cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  product warranty costs  royalties and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross margin is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and better yields from our foundries  product cost savings resulting from the benefits of favorable foundry pricing  and to a lesser extent  a product mix change  which included production ramps of our storage socs 
partially offsetting the increase in gross margins were higher product costs associated with inventory that was acquired from the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation  increased royalties  warranty expense and inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
the increase in royalties in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to higher sales of products that integrated licensed technology 
the increase in warranty expense is due to the increased volume of sales and extended warranties for certain customers 
the increase in inventory excess and obsolescence provisions is due to an increase in mature products for which there was lower forecasted demand 
the costs associated with contracted development work are included in research and development expense 
our gross margins may fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing of production ramps of new products  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors particularly in the consumer markets we are targeting  charges for obsolete or potentially excess inventory  changes in the costs charged by our manufacturing and test subcontractors and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development years ended january  change in research and development of net revenue research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional development personnel including personnel related to our acquisitions of the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation in november  which together resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
additionally  we incurred increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses  increased costs of million for tooling and engineering equipment expenses  increased costs of million for patent filing fees to protect newly developed intellectual property and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote resources to develop new products  migrate to lower process geometries  meet the changing requirements of our customers  expand into new markets and technologies  and hire additional personnel including those from our pending acquisitions 
selling and marketing years ended january  change in selling and marketing of net revenue selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  which all resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
additionally  we incurred higher commission costs of million due primarily to the increase in sales as well as other costs of million related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broaden our customer and product base and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that selling and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts into product markets such as consumer applications for our wireless and storage products 
general and administrative years ended january  change in general and administrative of net revenue general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to general and administrative personnel  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional administrative personnel  all of which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
offsetting the increase in general and administrative expenses was a decrease in legal fees and professional fees of million 
the decrease in legal and professional fees was due to the timing and volume of legal matters during the year and the increased hiring of legal and finance personnel resulting in lower outside legal and professional fees 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we expand our operations 
amortization of stock based compensation years ended january  change in amortization of stock based compensation of net revenue we have recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering of common stock and in connection with the grant and assumption of stock options as a result of our acquisitions 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting period 
the decrease in amortization expense in both absolute dollars and percentage of net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a lower balance of deferred stock based compensation being amortized in fiscal compared to fiscal for a discussion of the effects of future expensing of stock options  see recent accounting pronouncements 
amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other years ended january  change in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other of net revenue in connection with the acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of acquired intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisition of radlan  we recorded million of acquired intangible assets 
the acquired intangible assets from the radlan acquisition are being amortized over their estimated economic lives of two to five years 
in connection with the acquisition of asica  we recorded  of acquired intangible assets 
the acquired intangible assets from the asica acquisition are being amortized over their estimated economic life of five years 
in connection with the acquisition of the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation in november  we recorded million of acquired intangibles assets which are being amortized over their useful economic lives of two to four years 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a technology license and non assert agreement with a licensor pursuant to which the parties agreed to not take action against each other relative to the use of certain technologies 
under this arrangement  we agreed to make a one time payment of million  which is included in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into another technology license and non assert agreement with another company pursuant to which the parties agreed to not take action against each other relative to the use of certain technologies 
under this arrangement  we agreed to make a one time payment of million  of which million related to past use of certain technologies is included in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other  while the remaining million was capitalized as licensed technology and will be amortized to cost of goods sold over its estimated useful life of five years 
the decrease in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to million of charges for payments made on technology license and non assert agreements in fiscal partially offset by additional amortization of acquired intangible assets from the qlogic acquisition in fiscal acquired in process research and development years ended january  change in acquired in process research and development of net revenue in connection with the acquisition of the hard disk and tape drive controller business of qlogic corporation on november   we purchased in process research and development iprd of approximately million 
the amounts allocated to iprd were determined based on our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired using valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the projects that qualify for iprd had not reached technical feasibility and no future use existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to iprd meeting the above stated criteria were charge to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the value assigned to in process research and technology was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the fair values of iprd were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect additional risks related to the product s development and success as well as the product s stage of completion 
a discount rate of was used for iprd and rates between and were used for intangible assets 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that the project was approximately complete with aggregate costs to complete of million 
the project is in process and is expected to be completed by october the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
facilities consolidation charge years ended january  change in facilities consolidation charge of net revenue during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a total of million of charges associated with costs of consolidating and relocating operations in israel 
the charges included million associated with the write down of certain property and leasehold improvements related to the abandoned facilities and million of remaining lease commitments for these facilities 
prior to the consolidation of these facilities  we were leasing five separate facilities in israel located in geographically dispersed areas 
one of the locations was assumed through the acquisition of radlan 
the main factors that led to the consolidation of three of the five facilities into one location were a need to centralize operations into a convenient location near the center of the country and a focus on improving productivity by minimizing travel time between facilities 
as a result  we completed the consolidation of the majority of our israel operations into one facility during the third quarter of fiscal interest and other income  net years ended january  change in interest and other income  net of net revenue interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  and gains on the sale of marketable securities  offset by interest paid on capital lease obligations 
the increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest income due to higher comparable invested cash and marketable securities balances and higher yields on our investments 
provision for income taxes years ended january  change in provision for income taxes of net revenue our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal and  the effective rates were affected primarily by an increase in profits earned in jurisdictions where the tax rate is lower than the us tax rate and non tax deductible expenses  such as stock based compensation  nondeductible acquisition related expenses and charges related to asset impairment 
during fiscal  our german and israel subsidiaries underwent and completed corporate tax audits of years through and years through  respectively 
during fiscal  the internal revenue service irs completed an income tax audit for the fiscal years ended january   and of our us consolidated return 
the audits closed with no material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
years ended january  and net revenue years ended january  change in net revenue the increase in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our storage socs which increased by million  gigabit ethernet physical layer transceivers which increased by million and wireless products which increased by million 
the increases in net revenue are primarily due to increased acceptance of our storage soc products by hard disk drive manufacturers  increased market share gains in the pc desktop segment with our read channel and storage soc products  the continued adoption of our gigabit ethernet products as a replacement for fast ethernet products and volume shipments of our wireless products from new design wins 
revenue from storage products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue from communication products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net revenue derived from development contracts increased in fiscal  but represented less than of net revenue for each year and decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of goods sold years ended january  change in cost of goods sold of net revenue gross margin the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher period costs related to an increase in inventory excess and obsolescence charges of million for older  slow moving products as well as increased royalties of million  partially offset by lower product costs 
the primary factors that resulted in increased inventory excess and obsolescence charges in fiscal were i an increase in mature products for which there was lower forecasted demand  and ii the build up of inventory levels in response to longer lead times  capacity constraints at our foundries and increased demand from customers 
the decrease in product costs as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a product mix change  which included a higher mix of revenue from our storage socs and gigabit ethernet phy transceivers relative to other products 
the increase in royalties in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to higher sales of products that integrated licensed technology 
the costs associated with contracted development work are included in research and development expense 
research and development years ended january  change in research and development of net revenue the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional development personnel and a full year s impact of personnel related to our acquisitions of radlan in june and asica in november  which together resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
included in the increase in salary and related costs for fiscal is approximately million of compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of stock options previously granted to an employee 
additionally  we incurred increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  increased costs of million for outside services to assist in new product initiatives  increased cost of million for patent filing fees to protect newly developed intellectual property  increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
selling and marketing years ended january  change in selling and marketing of net revenue the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  which all resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
additionally  we incurred higher commission costs of million due primarily to the increase in sales as well as other costs of million related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broaden our customer and product base and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
general and administrative years ended january  change in general and administrative of net revenue the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net hiring of additional administrative personnel  all of which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
our expenses also increased due to higher professional fees of million due to attorney fees associated with our on going legal proceedings and million due to higher professional fees as a result of our expanding operations and costs to comply with the regulatory requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of stock based compensation years ended january  change in amortization of stock based compensation of net revenue deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting period 
the decrease in amortization expense in both absolute dollars and percentage of net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a lower balance of deferred stock based compensation being amortized in fiscal compared to fiscal as well as a result of the graded vesting method which results in declining amortization expense in later periods 
for a discussion of the effects of future expensing of stock options  see recent accounting pronouncements below 
amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other years ended january  change in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other of net revenue during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into a technology license and non assert agreement with another company pursuant to which the parties agreed to not take action against each other relative to the use of certain technologies 
under this arrangement  we agreed to make a one time payment of million  of which million related to past use of certain technologies is included in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other  while the remaining million was capitalized as licensed technology and will be amortized to cost of goods sold over its estimated useful life of five years 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into another technology license and non assert agreement with a licensor pursuant to which the parties agreed to not take action against each other relative to the use of certain technologies 
under this arrangement  we agreed to make a one time payment of million  which is included in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other 
the increase in amortization and write off of acquired intangible assets and other in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to million of charges for payments made on technology license and non assert agreements partially offset by a charge of million related to the recognition of pre acquisition losses due to our prior investments in radlan in fiscal facilities consolidation charge years ended january  change in facilities consolidation charge of net revenue during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a total of million of charges associated with costs of consolidating and relocating operations in israel 
the charges included million associated with the write down of certain property and leasehold improvements related to the abandoned facilities and million of remaining lease commitments for these facilities 
prior to the consolidation of these facilities  we were leasing five separate facilities in israel located in geographically dispersed areas

the main factors that led to the consolidation of three of the five facilities into one location were a need to centralize operations into a convenient location near the center of the country and a focus on improving productivity by minimizing travel time between facilities 
as a result  we completed the consolidation of the majority of our israel operations into one facility during the third quarter of fiscal at january   cash payments of million  net of sublease income had been made in connection with the facilities consolidation charges recorded in fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal approximately million is accrued for the facilities consolidation charge as of january   of which million is the current portion included in accrued liabilities while the long term portion totaling million is payable through the facilities consolidation charge is an estimate as of january  interest and other income  net years ended january  change in interest and other income  net of net revenue interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  and gains on the sale of marketable securities  offset by interest paid on capital lease obligations 
the increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest income on higher comparable invested cash balances and higher interest rates  partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense on capital lease obligations as a result of new cad software capital leases entered into in fiscal  lower realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal compared to million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal and a million loss on an equity method investment in fiscal provision for income taxes years ended january  change in provision for income taxes of net revenue our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal and the effective rates were affected primarily by an increase in the proportion of income earned in locations outside the us  which was taxed at lower income tax rates as well as by stock based compensation and non deductible expenses relating to our acquisitions  which were recorded as a result of using purchase accounting 
on august   the internal revenue service irs began an income tax audit of marvell semiconductor  inc msi  the main us subsidiary of marvell technology group ltd  for fiscal  and the audit was completed in fiscal with no material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events on february   the board of directors approved a for stock split of the company s common stock  to be effected pursuant to the issuance of additional shares as a stock dividend 
the stock split is subject to shareholder approval of an increase in the company s authorized share capital at the company s annual general meeting tentatively scheduled for june pending acquisitions on february   we completed the acquisition of the semiconductor division of utstarcom  inc for million in cash 
we may pay an additional million if certain defined milestones are achieved at various intervals through september we may also record a one time charge for purchased in process research and development expenses 
the amount of that charge  if any  would be recorded in our first quarter of fiscal  but has not yet been determined 
on february   we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the printer semiconductor business of avago technologies limited 
under the agreement  we will pay million in cash upon closing of the transaction 
we may pay an additional million if certain milestones are achieved at various intervals through october we may also record a one time charge for purchased in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition 
the amount of that charge  if any  and the period in which it would be recorded has not yet been determined 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity as of january  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities  cash generated by operations and cash assumed in acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the cash inflows from operations in fiscal were primarily the result of our generation of income during the period and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers relating to increased inventory purchases during fiscal as well as higher overall spending activity related to our expanding operations  an increase of million in income tax payable resulting from taxable income for fiscal  an increase of million in accrued compensation primarily related to an increase in the number of employee contributions under the employee stock purchase plan and higher benefit related obligations as a result of the increase in number of employees and an increase of million in deferred income resulting from increased shipments of product to our distributors as well as the increase in number of distributors 
significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase in prepaid and other assets of million due primarily to million in payments in connection with a capacity reservation agreement with a foundry  a million security deposit for long term assets under construction  and a million receivable from a foundry for reimbursements under a capacity reservation agreement 
also contributing to working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in the fiscal was an increase in inventory of million primarily a result of the increased in wafer starts to meet forecasted demand and changes in forecast of large volume consumer products 
as a result of the increase in inventory  the number of days in inventory  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  has increased to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal in addition  accounts receivable increased million primarily due to higher net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal although accounts receivable has increased  the days sales outstanding  or dso  metric  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  has decreased to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal many of our larger customers have regularly scheduled payment dates with some of the dates falling immediately before or after our fiscal year end 
as a result  our accounts receivable balance and dso may fluctuate depending on the timing of large payments by our customers 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the cash inflow from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our generation of income during the period and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million related to the tax benefit from employee stock transactions  million of amortization of stock based compensation and million for a charge in connection with a facilities consolidation

significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to higher net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal although accounts receivable has increased  the dso  which is calculated on a quarterly basis  remained relatively consistent at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal in the range of to days 
inventory increased by million primarily as a result of increased volumes of purchase orders received from our customers and associated purchases of inventory required to meet customer demand 
the number of days of inventory which is calculated on a quarterly basis  has remained reasonably consistent at days at the end of both fiscal and during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the cash inflow from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our generation of income during the period and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to the amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and other  million of depreciation and amortization expense and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash inflow in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers related to increased inventory purchases during fiscal  and higher overall spending activity related to our expanding operations and an increase of million relating to accrued employee compensation  primarily as the result of increased withholding taxes from the exercise of stock options by employees and increased accrued paid time off due primarily to the increase in number of employees in fiscal compared to fiscal significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flows in fiscal included a million increase in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to increases in our net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal although accounts receivable has increased  dso remained relatively consistent at the end of fiscal in the range of to days 
inventory increased by million  primarily as a result of increased volumes of purchase orders received from our customers and associated purchases of inventory required to meet such customer demand 
the number of days of inventory  increased at the end of fiscal to days compared to days at the end of fiscal as we began to build buffer inventory in the second half of fiscal in anticipation of longer production lead times and tighter capacity constraints at our foundries 
due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with net thirty to sixty day payment terms 
if our sales levels were to increase as they have in prior fiscal years  it is likely that our levels of accounts receivable would also increase 
our levels of accounts receivable would also increase if customers delayed their payments or if we offered extended payment terms to our customers 
additionally  in order to maintain an adequate supply of product for our customers  we must carry a certain level of inventory 
our inventory level may vary based primarily upon orders received from our customers and our forecast of demand for these products  as well as the initial production ramp for significant design wins 
other considerations in determining inventory levels may include the product life cycle stage of our products  foundry lead times and available capacity and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption

for all three fiscal years  the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock is due to exercises of stock options by employees and the increase in capital lease obligations is due to additional cad software licenses  which we have acquired for use in our research and development activities 
contractual obligations and commitments our relationships with our foundries allow us to cancel all outstanding purchase orders  provided we pay the foundries for all expenses they have incurred in connection with our purchase orders through the date of cancellation

the lease commenced on january  and was amended in the third quarter of fiscal to end december  in february  we consolidated our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the leases on two of our former facilities expired in february and june  respectively  but we have an ongoing  non cancelable lease for the remaining facility  for which we have obtained a sublease 
actual sublease income approximated the estimated sublease income  but is less than our actual lease commitment  resulting in future negative cash flow over the remaining term of the sublease of approximately million as of january  at january   cash payments of million  net of sublease income had been made in connection with this charge 
approximately million is accrued for this facilities consolidation charge as of january  of which million is the current portion while the long term portion totaling million is payable through during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a total of million of charges associated with costs of consolidating and relocating operations in israel

certificates for  shares earned through august  were issued on december  the remaining  shares earned subsequent to august  were issued on july  we expect to make significant commitments and incur costs to improve the buildings at our us headquarters located in santa clara  ca over the next twelve to eighteen months 
based upon our current forecasts  we currently expect to spend approximately million to million for building improvements over the next twelve to eighteen months  of which million of non cancelable purchase orders is currently outstanding 
the amount that we plan to spend and commit for building improvements is an estimate and may change as the scope of the work is refined and plans are finalized 
in addition  we expect an increase in future operating expenses due to the new buildings  thereby increasing the amount of occupancy costs that will be allocated to cost of goods sold  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
on november   we completed the acquisition of the hard disk and tape drive controller semiconductor business of qlogic corporation qlogic

we currently intend to fund our short and long term capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as well as cash generated by operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital requirements  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and extent of research and development projects  costs of making improvements to facilities and increases in operating expenses  which are all subject to uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we may enter into additional acquisitions or other strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period thereafter total contractual obligations operating leases capital lease obligations purchase commitments to foundries capacity reservation commitment mask purchase commitment capital purchase obligations utstarcom asset purchase commitment total contractual cash obligations excludes million payable if certain defined milestones are achieved

on february   we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the printer semiconductor business of avago technologies limited 
under the agreement  we will pay million in cash upon closing of the transaction 
we may pay an additional million if certain defined milestones are achieved at various intervals through october we may also record a one time charge for purchased in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition

as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we adopted sfas r on february  upon adoption  this statement will have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes as is our current practice see note of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas r we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas r 
we will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and statement no 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
also variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities including money market funds  corporate debt securities  federal  state  county and municipal debt securities and auction rate securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of january  in thousands 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
although auction rate securities generally have legally stated maturities in excess of one year  auction rate securities are presented below with an expected fiscal year maturity date in because such securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days at which time we can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
expected fiscal year maturity date total fair value variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments  which totaled million at january   are included in other non current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method because our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations on these companies 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses to date have been denominated in united states dollars  and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
occasionally  we will enter into short term forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures for purchases denominated in foreign currencies such as the singapore dollar and the new israeli shekel 
we do not enter into any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
