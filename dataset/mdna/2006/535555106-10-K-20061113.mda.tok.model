such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are critical  as these policies are most important to the presentation of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
they require the greatest use of judgments and estimates 
table of contents by management based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management periodically re evaluates and adjusts the estimates that are used as circumstances change 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company reevaluated its revenue recognition policy and removed it from its critical accounting policies 
this decision was made because there is not a significant amount of estimation or judgment used in determining revenue recognition 
during the first quarter of fiscal the company adopted sfas r 
management does not consider this a critical accounting policy  and there were no other significant changes in the company s critical accounting policies during fiscal following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market

domestic irrigation revenues increased million or over fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily a result of an increase in the volume of units shipped during the year 
in addition  price increases implemented during the year increased revenues 
demand was generally affected by improving domestic farmer sentiment 
increased ethanol production continued to support the increase in corn prices experienced during fiscal recent usda estimates place corn usage for ethanol at approximately of total corn usage for the crop year and higher than in the previous year 
there are now more than ethanol biorefineries operating in the us  and more than either under construction or expanding 
continued dry conditions in the western united states and stabilized crop prices have created a stronger market for irrigation equipment 
international irrigation revenues increased million or over fiscal most of the international revenue increase was realized in latin america excluding brazil  china  australia  new zealand  and the middle east 
the agricultural sector in brazil remains depressed  in spite of the brazilian government s announced support plans which include debt extensions  lower interest rates and higher debt limits 
during fiscal  the company experienced revenue growth in china

infrastructure products segment revenues increased by million or compared to fiscal on june   the company completed the acquisition of barrier systems  inc bsi a manufacturer of movable barrier systems and road safety products 
this acquisition added million of sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal the acquisition reflects the execution of the company s strategy to build up its infrastructure manufacturing

bsi has been a customer of the company s infrastructure products segment for many years  and the company sees exciting opportunities to create shareholder value through manufacturing synergies  supporting bsi s expansion in the united states  and in international expansion where the company can provide support through its local entities 
with the addition of bsi  the company continues to build its infrastructure revenues through proprietary products  commercial tubing  and selected contract manufacturing 
in total international revenues were of total revenues for fiscal as compared to for fiscal gross margin gross margin was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the improved margins resulted from the inclusion of higher margin bsi products  stronger effective pricing on irrigation equipment  and higher factory volume as compared to the prior year 
during the fiscal year  the company experienced rapidly rising costs in zinc and copper  which are approximately and respectively  of the cost of a standard irrigation pivot 
at the same time  steel costs remained relatively stable

the company proactively responded to the rising costs by passing through multiple price increases on its products 
the environment for passing through and retaining those price increases was improved over fiscal due to overall higher product demand 
the company expects to be able to maintain or further increase prices which should allow it to realize margin improvements as material costs stabilize 
in addition  the company is realizing benefits from manufacturing and scheduling improvements implemented at the lindsay  nebraska facility 
the company experienced improvements resulting from the higher volume and from the lean manufacturing principles implemented

these gains were offset by a loss of other income from a minority ownership in the canadian dealership due to the sale of this interest on september  the company s effective tax rate for the income tax provision was for the fiscal year ended august  compared to in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a higher us statutory rate due to the increase in taxable income  the continued phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion  lower federal tax exempt interest income and higher state and local tax rates due to the increase in the number of state filings resulting from the bsi acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by the qualified export activity  domestic production deduction included in the american jobs creation act of and a non recurring tax benefit 
this non recurring tax benefit of approximately  included a credit adjustment of  of prior estimated federal and state tax liabilities  a credit adjustment of  of prior estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the company s recently completed irs examination offset by a  tax expense resulting from the company s recently completed state examination 
this benefit reduced the company s effective tax rate by points for the fiscal year ended august  overall  the company benefits from a us effective tax rate which is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the qualified export activity and domestic production deductions and the federal tax exempt interest income on its investment portfolio

domestic irrigation revenues declined by million or from fiscal the decline in domestic irrigation revenue was due to a decline in unit volume of approximately as compared to prior year  which was partially offset by an increase in the selling price of irrigation equipment of approximately 
management believes that a combination of factors contributed to the lower demand for irrigation equipment during the year 
these factors include generally lower agricultural commodity prices  higher farm input costs  and a reduction in drought conditions 
the price of corn declined approximately  cotton declined approximately and soybeans remained flat  from the same time last year 
in addition  strong us harvests are expected for this fall season 
while ethanol demand continues to drive corn usage higher  ending inventories for corn are expected to remain high 
the overall growing conditions for farmers throughout most of the united states remained favorable 
the drought conditions experienced in much of the west and plains regions were greatly alleviated 
the combination of these factors and higher costs for energy  fertilizer and other farm inputs contributed to reduced demand for products such as irrigation equipment  which represent substantial capital expenditures 
international irrigation revenues remained flat in fiscal at million compared to million in fiscal the acquisition of stettyn  the irrigation company in south africa  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents contributed additional revenues during the year 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by many of the same factors affecting domestic sales of irrigation equipment  including the negative effects of depressed agricultural commodity prices

towards the end of the fiscal year  the company experienced a slight reduction in steel costs from the high level of fiscal in addition  gross margins for fiscal were negatively affected by the field repair campaign announced during the fourth quarter  which decreased pre tax earnings by million 
company wide cost reduction actions have partially offset lower domestic unit volumes and contributed to improved international and infrastructure manufacturing margins 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses for fiscal increased  or over fiscal operating expenses were positively affected by cost reduction efforts during the year  but these savings were largely offset by incremental operating expenses of  incurred at the stettyn operation which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company incurred additional costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance of approximately  higher than finally  operating expenses included a non recurring bad debt charge related to the insolvency of a kansas dealership of  interest income  other income  and taxes fiscal net interest income of million was a decrease of  as compared to this decrease primarily reflects a reduction of interest income from securities due to smaller balances held in marketable securities and higher balances in interest bearing accounts earning a lower interest rate
