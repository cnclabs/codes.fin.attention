our key fiscal year financial results worldwide average net selling prices improved percent in fiscal year worldwide volume increased percent in fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
operating margins increased basis points to percent in fiscal year we generated operating income of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this included a benefit of million in fiscal year due to the proceeds from the high fructose corn syrup litigation settlement 
we generated cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year we reported diluted net income per share of for the fiscal year  compared to diluted net income per share of in the prior year 
our focus in fiscal year we managed our business to optimize shareholder value through our focus on the balance between volume and pricing  improved cost performance  strong execution in the marketplace  and enhanced utilization of our international infrastructure 
the challenges and opportunities we faced in our geographic segments are summarized as follows in the us despite the challenges set forth below  we grew operating income by million to million 
in january  we acquired cic  our largest acquisition since the pepsiamericas merger in cic provides us access to a florida market  which is a faster growing market than our existing us markets  as well as additional territories that are contiguous to our existing operations in ohio 
the meaningful contribution of this acquisition and the strong performance of our non carbonated category drove solid financial results 
we continued to drive initiatives to expand our single serve business that provides consumers the convenience of immediate consumption of our products 
in fiscal year  we continued our emphasis on the total liquid refreshment beverage category and not just carbonated soft drinks 
we saw an opportunity for growth in the non carbonated beverage category and introduced aquafina flavorsplash 
we also focused on expanding our presence in the energy drink category  which includes products such as adrenaline rush  amp and no fear 
additionally  we experienced growth in our lipton iced tea and ready to drink coffee products 
the most significant challenges we faced were volume declines in our carbonated soft drink category  raw material cost increases  a shortage of pet bottle supply and the impact of hurricane katrina 
price increases in raw materials such as aluminum  fuel and resin challenged our business throughout the year 
the direct and indirect effects of hurricane katrina further impacted prices for fuel  energy and packaging costs  specifically resin 
during the second half of the year  we experienced difficulties in procuring sufficient quantities of pet bottles that limited the volume growth in our aquafina products 
changing consumer preferences have driven volume declines in brand pepsi and brand mountain dew of percent and percent  respectively  and a shift in our total portfolio mix as us consumers are moving to diet carbonated soft drinks and healthier  non carbonated alternatives 
trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprised percent of our sales volume  a decrease from percent in fiscal year on a constant territory basis  which refers to the results of operations excluding the acquisition of cic  our volume growth in fiscal year was essentially flat 
we were able to offset the effects of volume softness in the carbonated soft drink category and higher raw material costs through our pricing initiatives 
for the third consecutive year  pricing drove our top line growth 
volume growth in the non carbonated beverage and sports drink energy categories was offset by volume declines in our core trademarks 
our international operations 
for the third consecutive year  we achieved profitability in our combined international operations due to our focus on pricing  managing costs  and leveraging our infrastructure 
in fiscal year  we generated a total of million in operating income in central europe and the caribbean  which included the favorable impact of foreign currency translation offset by the impact of special charges of million 
this compares to operating income in our international operations of million in fiscal year  which included special charges of million 
in central europe  operating income declined million due primarily to challenges we faced in hungary 
in this market  we were challenged by a competitive water market  pricing pressures in the carbonated soft drink category and changing trade and channel dynamics 
additionally  we experienced significantly higher raw material costs  including resin and sugar 
while these challenges are present  we have implemented various initiatives to counteract these conditions across central europe 
we leveraged our existing distribution systems by expanding into new product lines such as the introduction of frito lay snack foods in the czech republic in fiscal year and in hungary in fiscal year we initiated a new relationship with inbev and began distributing beck s brand beer in poland in the middle of fiscal year we continued to cut costs through the further rationalization of our business  including the closure of two plants and other cost reduction programs 
we sourced more products between the countries in order to reduce costs and take advantage of the reduction in trade restrictions made possible by our markets joining the european union eu 
we successfully introduced new products such as slice and tropicana juice drinks 
lastly  we expanded our geographic footprint through our percent investment in qabcl  the pepsi bottler in romania and moldova 
in the caribbean  we were challenged by the macroeconomic and political conditions that existed in puerto rico 
operating income declined million to million in fiscal year due to economic conditions that affected puerto rico  as well as the impact caused by the difficult hurricane season in jamaica 
in puerto rico  a country wide labor strike impacted our supply of raw materials  which limited sales for a short period of time 
in addition  we saw an economic slowdown in puerto rico as consumers became more wary of inflation 
while the hurricanes in jamaica did not cause any severe damage  flooding became an issue and affected net sales 
despite these challenges  the caribbean continued to drive the initiatives that contributed to its strong performance in fiscal year non carbonated beverages and flavored beverages continued to contribute to volume growth 
during fiscal year  we continued to distribute frito lay snack food products through retail channels in trinidad and tobago and through vending channels in puerto rico 
focusing on fiscal year looking ahead to fiscal year  we are focused on continuing to drive top line growth and finding an appropriate balance between volume and price 
pricing  with a focus on both rate and mix  continues to be a driving factor in achieving our top line growth 
our plans include increased emphasis on volume in the growth categories based on the continued shift in consumer demand and increased interest in products related to health and wellness  such as non carbonated beverages  energy drinks  water  and the diet category 
in addition  we will continue to focus on our single serve  immediate consumption business across all channels and products with a primary emphasis on the on premise channel 
we will continue to focus on product line extension and packaging innovation to drive consumer awareness 
we expect volume to benefit from our marketing calendar and product line extensions that will provide exciting brand and package programs during the entire year 
we are in the process of rolling out a reformulated diet mountain dew and continue to expand our non carbonated beverage offerings with new flavors of lipton branded teas and aquafina flavorsplash grape and the introduction of sobe lifewater 
we also plan to introduce new starbucks ready to drink coffee flavors and a new liter multi pack package for tropicana and lipton beverages in the first quarter of lastly  we acquired ardea beverage co 
and its brand  airforce nutrisoda  in january to further expand our alternative beverage category offerings 
in central europe and the caribbean  we seek to continue our top line growth through product expansion and the distribution of snack foods and beer 
additionally  we will evaluate our option to expand our investment in romania 
in fiscal year  we expect to achieve diluted income per share of to  compared to fiscal year diluted income per share of 
net income growth in fiscal year benefited by per diluted share due to the adjustments described in selected financial data in item we expect worldwide volume to increase in the range of to percent  including growth of to percent in the us  and to improve average net selling price by to percent 
we expect cost of goods sold per unit to increase approximately percent  and selling  delivery and administrative sd a expenses to be higher by to percent compared to fiscal year overall  we expect to generate operating income growth of to percent 
this growth target is based on fiscal year operating income that excludes the impact of the fructose settlement  special charges and other unusual items 
our success in achieving operating income growth and managing our working capital drove our operating cash flow of million in fiscal year our ability to generate significant operating cash flow makes several options available to us  including paying dividends to our shareholders  repurchasing our stock  reinvesting in our existing business and pursuing acquisitions with an appropriate economic return 
we continue to examine the optimal uses of cash to maximize shareholder value

operating results compared with items impacting comparability hurricane katrina 
our operations in the us were impacted by the devastation created by hurricane katrina in september we incurred losses due to damaged marketing equipment  inventory write offs  incremental freight costs incurred to source product to the impacted area from our other locations and other incremental costs incurred to restart operations 
losses  net of insurance recoveries  recorded in cost of goods sold and sales  delivery and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million and million  respectively 
volume 
sales volume growth declines for fiscal years and were as follows us central europe caribbean worldwide in fiscal year  worldwide volume increased percent compared to the prior year due mainly to the impact of the cic acquisition  which contributed percent of the worldwide volume growth 
additionally  sales volume in central europe in fiscal year was stronger than the volume that we experienced during fiscal year in fiscal year  volume in central europe was unfavorably impacted by the accession of our markets into the eu 
the percent growth in us volume in fiscal year was primarily attributed to the incremental volume from the cic acquisition 
on a constant territory basis  us volume remained essentially flat 
the double digit growth in our non carbonated beverages category was offset by low single digit declines in carbonated soft drinks 
growth in non carbonated beverages was driven primarily by a percent increase in aquafina volume  which included the introduction of aquafina flavor splash in the first quarter of in addition  double digit growth in sports and energy drinks contributed to the overall growth in the non carbonated beverage category 
non carbonated beverages represented percent of our overall portfolio in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year we experienced single digit volume declines in trademarks pepsi and mountain dew  offset partly by single digit growth in both our overall diet category and trademark dr pepper 
total volume in central europe increased percent during fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced volume declines due primarily to the market wide increases in costs related to the accession of our markets into the eu 
we also experienced cold weather conditions in the late spring and early summer of fiscal year that negatively impacted volume 
therefore  fiscal year volume improvement was partially attributed to the soft performance we experienced during fiscal year the remainder of growth in volume for fiscal year was driven by a high single digit increase in the premium carbonated soft drink category  driven by promotional efforts for trademark pepsi in a liter package and a positive consumer response to pricing in republic of slovakia 
the successful launch of slice in all markets to compete against our competitors value brands also drove volume throughout fiscal year the launch of tropicana juice drinks in hungary and improved promotional activities for other juice brands in the czech republic and republic of slovakia drove volume growth in the non carbonated beverage category 
volume growth in those categories was partly offset by a high single digit decline in the water category due to the highly competitive water environment  especially in hungary 
volume in the caribbean increased percent during fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
the volume increase reflected volume growth across all markets as well as the two months of incremental volume provided by the bahamas in fiscal year we acquired a majority interest in the bahamas in march and the bahamas was included in our consolidated results at that time 
volume was driven by double digit growth in the non carbonated beverage category and high single digit growth in flavors 
volume increases in these categories were partly offset by the negative impacts caused by a difficult hurricane season in jamaica and a country wide labor strike that limited raw material supply for a short period of time in puerto rico 
in addition  an economic slowdown in puerto rico during the fourth quarter of also negatively impacted volume 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for fiscal years and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in fiscal year increased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million in fiscal year the percent increase in worldwide net sales reflected an increase in net pricing and volume and the incremental benefit of the cic acquisition 
net sales in the us in fiscal year increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the prior year 
approximately two thirds of the increase in net sales in the us was the result of the incremental net sales contributed by the cic territories 
the remainder of the increase in net sales was primarily due to the percent increase in net pricing 
the improvement in net pricing was driven by a two thirds contribution from price and a one third contribution from changes in package mix 
the increase in pricing reflected our initiative to grow our single serve category 
net sales increases were also driven by successful promotional efforts during fiscal year  including holiday activity and continued product innovation with the reformulation of wild cherry pepsi  cherry vanilla dr pepper and pepsi one 
net sales also benefited from line extensions with the introduction of pepsi lime and aquafina flavorsplash 
net sales in central europe increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal year from million in the prior year 
the increase resulted from a percent volume increase and a percent increase in net pricing driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
foreign currency translation contributed million to net sales growth in fiscal year on a local currency basis  net pricing declined due to the overall competitive pricing environment and promotional activity executed in our markets 
caribbean net sales increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
both a net selling price increase of percent and volume growth of percent drove the increase in net sales

in the us  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily driven by the incremental cost of goods sold attributable to cic  which represented approximately two thirds of the increase  and a higher cost of goods sold per unit 
cost of goods sold per unit increased percent in the us  primarily due to price increases in aluminum  fuel and resin 
we were able to mitigate  in part  the increase in aluminum and fuel costs with our hedging program 
on average  concentrate prices from pepsico for carbonated soft drinks were approximately percent higher in fiscal year than the prior year 
in central europe  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to volume growth of percent  higher raw material costs and the million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation

operating income in the caribbean decreased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decline was due in part to the economic slowdown and country wide labor strike in puerto rico 
the decrease also reflected increased operating costs  primarily for fuel  utilities and resin 
interest and other expenses 
interest expense  net  increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was due to higher debt levels of over million since the end of fiscal year  used primarily to finance our acquisition of cic and our investment in qabcl  and a million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt 
the extinguished debt was refinanced with new debt maturing in and interest expense related to variable rate debt also contributed to the increase due to the increase in short term interest rates during fiscal year the increase in interest expense was partly offset by the receipt of million of interest income related to a real estate tax appeals refund on a previously sold parcel of land

operating results compared with items impacting comparability fiscal year 
our us operations report using a fiscal year that ends on the saturday closest to december and as a result  a rd week is added every five to six years 
fiscal years and consisted of weeks ended on december  and january   respectively 
fiscal year consisted of weeks ended on january  our central europe and caribbean operations fiscal years end on december st and therefore were not impacted by the rd week in fiscal year the following table illustrates the approximate dollars in millions and percentage points of growth that the incremental week contributed to our fiscal year operating results dollars percentage points net sales gross profit selling  delivery and administrative expenses operating income volume 
sales volume growth declines for fiscal years and were as follows us central europe caribbean worldwide in fiscal year  worldwide volume decreased percent compared to the prior year  mainly attributable to volume declines of percent in the us and percent in central europe partially offset by caribbean volume growth of percent 
the decline in worldwide volume for the year was mainly due to the lapping of the rd week in fiscal year in the us  lower volumes in our core pepsi trademark  and the impact of the entry of our markets into the eu in may the decline in us volume of percent in fiscal year reflected the lapping of the rd week in fiscal year and softness in our pepsi and mountain dew brands  partially offset by high single digit volume growth in our non carbonated beverage portfolio 
the lapping of the incremental rd week contributed percent to the us volume decline in fiscal year trademark pepsi experienced mid single digit declines  driven mainly by lower volumes in brand pepsi  offset  in part  by continued strength in the diet pepsi brands and growth from product innovation during fiscal year volume in trademark mountain dew was relatively flat in fiscal year compared to the prior year  driven by growth in brand diet mountain dew and the introduction of mountain dew pitch black during the third quarter of  offset by the impact of lapping our mountain dew livewire product launch in the first quarter of trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprise approximately percent of our total volume 
non carbonated beverage growth was driven by double digit growth in aquafina volume and the introduction of tropicana juice drinks in february volume in central europe decreased percent during fiscal year this decline was driven primarily by market wide increases in costs related to the accession of our markets into the eu  including increases in retailer prices  higher raw material costs  increased value added taxes and higher utility costs as a result of privatization of those industries 
we also experienced cold weather conditions in the late spring and early summer that negatively impacted volume 
despite these challenges  the rate of volume declines slowed with each sequential quarter in fiscal year in central europe  carbonated soft drinks account for approximately percent of total volume  while the water category and other non carbonated beverages comprise our remaining volume 
our carbonated soft drink business declined in the low double digits driven primarily by a high single digit volume decline in trademark pepsi and double digit volume declines in other carbonated soft drinks 
our water category experienced double digit volume declines during fiscal year despite successful promotional activity in the first quarter 
volume in the caribbean increased percent compared to the same period last year  primarily driven by the percent volume contribution from the consolidation of the bahamas 
the volume growth of for the remainder of the caribbean was mainly driven by volume growth in puerto rico  offset by volume declines in jamaica as a result of higher pricing 
the introduction of the essential water brand contributed to the volume growth  as well as the expansion of our product portfolio 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for fiscal years and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth decline us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in fiscal year increased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million in fiscal year the percent increase in worldwide net sales primarily reflected an increase in net average selling prices in all three geographic segments  offset  in part  by the impact of volume declines in both the us and central europe 
net sales in the us in fiscal year increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the prior year 
this increase occurred despite the lapping of the incremental rd week  which contributed million to net sales in fiscal year the increase in us net sales was the result of improved net selling prices of percent  which offset the impact of the lower volumes in fiscal year the improvement in net pricing was driven by rate increases of approximately percent and package mix contribution of percent 
the top line growth was driven by our focus on our single serve packages and our disciplined approach to pricing across all geographic segments  as well as strong contributions from our non carbonated beverage category  most notably double digit growth in aquafina and the introduction of tropicana juice drinks 
net sales in central europe decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal year from million in the prior year 
the decrease resulted from a volume decrease of percent  which was partially offset by a percent increase in net pricing  aided by the impact of foreign currency translation 
foreign currency translation contributed million to net sales  which accounted for approximately percent of the net pricing growth in fiscal year as a result of the cost pressures associated with our markets accession into the eu  we increased our net pricing starting in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of promotional efforts in the first quarter of enabled us to maintain volume while we continued to maintain pricing during this period 
the reduction of these promotional activities after the first quarter of and the impact of the accession of our markets into the eu contributed to the decreases in volume during the balance of fiscal year  as consumers were impacted by the higher price points on many consumer products 
customers appeared to be adjusting to the higher pricing during the balance of the year  as the rate of volume declines slowed with each sequential quarter in fiscal year caribbean net sales increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales resulted from the million contribution from the consolidation of the bahamas beginning in the first quarter of the remainder of the increase in net sales was mainly due to the increase in net pricing in puerto rico  jamaica  and trinidad and tobago

cost of goods sold per unit increased percent in the us  primarily driven by price increases in aluminum  fuel and resin 
we were able to mitigate  in part  the increase in aluminum costs with our hedging program 
in addition  concentrate costs  which represented approximately percent of total product costs in the us  were higher as pepsico concentrate prices on carbonated soft drinks increased on average by approximately percent beginning in february in central europe  cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  to million compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to volume declines of percent  offset by higher raw material costs and the million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
higher sugar prices after the accession of our markets into the eu  as well as higher fuel and resin costs  contributed to the percent increase in cost of goods sold per unit during fiscal year in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in fiscal year  driven mainly by the consolidation of the bahamas beginning in the first quarter of which contributed more than half of the increase in cost of goods sold 
the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in volume of percent for the remainder of the caribbean and a higher cost of goods sold per unit  primarily due to higher operating costs

we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
we believe that our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our existing operations and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe that our operating cash flows  available lines of credit  and the potential for additional debt and equity offerings will provide sufficient resources to fund our future growth and expansion

we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations  net of insurance  under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including indemnification expenses for potential environmental and tort liabilities of these prior subsidiaries 
there is significant uncertainty in assessing our potential expenses for complying with our indemnification obligations  as the determination of such amounts is subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries and the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible and financially viable parties 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement and timing of cash requirements related to such indemnification obligations may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements

this amount excludes possible insurance recoveries and is determined on an undiscounted cash flow basis

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts or revisions become known 
presented in our notes to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of our most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of such statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include goodwill impairment  environmental liabilities  income taxes and casualty insurance costs which are described in further detail below goodwill impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach at the reporting unit level us  central europe and the caribbean 
first  we estimate the fair value of the reporting units primarily using discounted estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the potential loss 
goodwill impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
the impairment evaluation requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine the fair value of the reporting units using discounted future cash flows  including estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates 
environmental liabilities 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including potential environmental liabilities see environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have recorded our best estimate of our probable liability under those indemnification obligations  with the assistance of outside consultants and other professionals 
the estimated indemnification liabilities include expenses for the remediation of identified sites  payments to third parties for claims and expenses including product liability and toxic tort claims  administrative expenses  and the expense of on going evaluations and litigation 
such estimates and the recorded liabilities are subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries  the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible parties  the advancement of technology for means of remediation  possible changes in the scope of work at the contaminated sites  as well as possible changes in related laws  regulations  and agency requirements 
we do not discount environmental liabilities 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established valuation allowances against a portion of the non us net operating losses to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the realizability of our net operating losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such estimates may differ 
the valuation allowance can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining our contingent tax liabilities 
we have established contingent tax liabilities using management s best judgment and adjust these liabilities as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax liabilities in any given period could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows for that period 
casualty insurance costs 
due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
we are self insured for workers compensation  product and general liability up to million per occurrence and automobile liability up to million per occurrence 
the casualty insurance costs for our self insurance program represent the ultimate net cost of all reported and estimated unreported losses incurred during the fiscal year 
we do not discount casualty insurance liabilities 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are based on the best data available to us 
these estimates  however  are also subject to a significant degree of inherent variability  including the relatively recent increases in medical costs 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate and within acceptable industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or economic events outside our control could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are subject to various market risks  including risks from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
commodity prices 
the risk from commodity price changes relates to our ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of anticipated purchases of certain commodities used in our operations  including aluminum and diesel fuel 
due to the high correlation between such commodity prices and our cost of these products  we consider these hedges to be highly effective 
at the end of fiscal year  we have hedged a portion of our anticipated aluminum purchases through november  while we have hedged a portion of our anticipated diesel fuel purchases through december interest rates 
our floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense 
in fiscal year  we had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
the amount of these investments was not significant throughout the year 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates 
because we operate in non us franchise territories  we are subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
we currently do not hedge the translation risks of investments in our non us operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
based on net sales  non us operations represented approximately percent of our total operations in fiscal year changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the non us operations results from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by ten percent in fiscal year  we estimate the impact on operating income would have been approximately million 
our estimate reflects the fact that a portion of the non us operations costs are denominated in us dollars  including concentrate purchases 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category
