item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview avx corporation is a leading worldwide manufacturer and supplier of a broad line of passive electronics components and interconnected products 
the company has five main product groups ceramic  tantalum  advanced  connectors and kyocera electronic devices 
these product lines are organized into three reportable segments passive components  connectors and ked resale 
the company and our industry have gone through a very difficult cycle over the past five years 
during fiscal  we have seen improving trends throughout the industry 
we believe that the demand for our products has caught up with the current capacity in our industry resulting in a more stable pricing environment and improving market conditions 
in fiscal  we experienced our highest revenues and earnings since the end of the tech bubble in fiscal consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were  million with net income of million compared to consolidated revenues of  million with net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal  we saw strong financial results in the first half of the year during an economic upturn followed by a decline during the second half of the year as distributors and manufacturers utilization of existing inventories in the supply chain contributed to pricing pressure and declining results 
in fiscal  we generated operating cash flow of million 
we use cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures  repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends 
we have million of cash  cash equivalents and securities investments and no debt as of march we continue to invest in new products and improvements to the production processes and are committed to investing in research  development and engineering in order to provide our customers with a new generation of passive component and connector product solutions 
we are currently producing more sophisticated electronic component parts resulting from an increase in functionality of the devices that are manufactured by our customers 
as a result  we have increased our focus on value added advanced products necessary to meet the demands of the increasingly sophisticated end user products 
we are also focused on controlling costs 
we do this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies  controlling purchases and expanding into lower cost labor areas 
we believe that this philosophy will enable us to capitalize on the improved market conditions and provide continuing shareholder value 
outlook near term as noted above  the electronic component industry has shown continuous improvement during the fiscal year following the slow down during the second half of fiscal year this improvement resulted in our highest revenue and net income since the end of the tech bubble in fiscal we believe that the overall market will continue to grow during fiscal our near term results will depend on growth in the economy and resulting expansion in the telecommunications  information technology hardware  automotive  medical and other electronic markets 
we expect a stable pricing environment as we believe that demand for our products has caught up with capacity 
additionally  during fiscal we saw benefits from restructuring programs  manufacturing realignments to lower cost areas and other cost reduction programs initiated in recent years that will continue to benefit us into the future 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with current demand and future expectations 
long term we continue to be optimistic that opportunities of long term growth and profitability will continue due to a the continued increase as a long term trend in worldwide demand for electronic devices which require our electronic components  b cost reductions and improvements in our production processes and c opportunities for growth in our advanced product line due to advances in component design and more sophisticated end user requirements 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to  million compared to  million for the fiscal year ended march  the table below represents product group revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and years ended march  sales revenue in thousands ceramic components tantalum components advanced components total passive components kdp and kss resale kec resale connectors total ked resale connectors total revenue with the increased use and functionality of today s electronic devices  the demand for electronic components continues to increase 
this demand in conjunction with favorable economic conditions resulted in improved sales for all of our product groups 
compared to the prior year  passive components sales increased million  or  to million  kdp and kss resale sales increased million  or  to million and total connector sales  including kec resale connectors  increased million  or  to million 
the sales increase in passive components was primarily due to improved end user demand for products containing passive electronic components and lower inventory levels in the supply chain 
electronic devices are increasing in both quantity and in the number of internal passive electronic components necessary to meet the demands of these smaller and more sophisticated products 
passive component volumes increased approximately compared to the prior year reflecting the increased demand and improved economic conditions during fiscal year the company saw continued moderate pricing pressure during the first half of the year on commodity related products resulting from the industry s production capacity exceeding demand during this period 
prices stabilized during the second half of the year due to increased demand and increased industry capacity utilization 
advanced component sales include and of tantalum advanced component sales and and of ceramic advanced component sales during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
kdp and kss resale sales increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to sales of million for the prior year 
the increase is attributable to a increase in sales volume resulting from increased customer demand partially offset by lower average selling prices resulting primarily from changes in product mix when compared to the prior year 
connector sales  including kec resale connectors  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in volume due to increased customer demand and new programs  particularly in the automotive sector 
our sales to independent electronic component distributor customers represented of total sales for the fiscal year ended march   compared to for the fiscal year ended march  our sales to distributors involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs and price concessions for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales 
we record an estimated sales allowance for ship and debit and stock rotation at the time of sale based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
charges for ship and debit and stock rotation were million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to charges of million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease is a result of a more stable pricing environment and lower distributor inventory levels during fiscal resulting in fewer requirements for ship and debit and stock rotation 
we had remaining allowances for ship and debit and stock rotation of million and million at march  and  respectively 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales increased in asia and in the americas  partially offset by a decrease of in europe reflecting increased customer production and demand in the asian region 
in addition  the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies negatively impacted sales by million during the fiscal year  when compared to the same period last year 
unit sales volumes increased by in asia and in the americas and europe was down slightly compared to the same period last year  reflecting the continued shift of customer production and increasing end user demand to the asian region 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  increased to of sales  or million  to million compared to of sales  or million  in the fiscal year ended march  this increase is due to higher sales volumes and a product mix reflecting the company s marketing focus on higher margin value added products in addition to improved cost absorption due to higher production volumes and an improved cost structure as the company continues to move production to lower cost facilities and reduce operating costs 
depreciation expense declined by million as a result of lower capital spending during the past several years 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended march   costs were favorably impacted by million due to exchange as the us dollar strengthened against certain foreign currencies when compared to the same period last year 
we continue to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and to incur additional costs associated with the transfer of manufacturing operations to lower cost areas in china  malaysia  el salvador and the czech republic from facilities in the americas and europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or million  to million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase  commensurate with an increase in sales  was due to slightly increased direct selling expense  employee benefit costs and non manufacturing depreciation  partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new and maintaining existing products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development costs declined slightly in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal engineering expenses declined million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as the manufacturing processes for new products and product enhancements matured  requiring less engineering expenditures  and processes were transferred to full production 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  other income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily due to higher interest income resulting from improved rates of return on higher average balances of invested cash and securities 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was 
income taxes in the current fiscal year were favorably impacted by million as a result of the favorable settlement of certain income tax exposures related to prior years 
in addition  we realized increased tax benefits resulting from operating losses for certain european and asian operations due to higher net income 
this compares to an effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march  for the fiscal years ended march  and we reversed million and million  respectively  of valuation allowances related to operating losses in certain foreign and state jurisdictions as a result of improved current and expected future profitability in those jurisdictions 
we provide allowances against future tax benefits where there is a greater likelihood of not realizing the future tax benefits of net operating losses than of realizing them 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to  million compared to  million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year  passive components sales decreased million  or  to million  while kdp and kss resale sales  excluding kec resale connectors  increased million  or  to million and total connector sales  including kec resale connectors  increased million  or  to million 
the decline in passive component sales reflects decreased demand during the second half of fiscal as distributors and manufacturers utilized existing inventories in the supply chain in addition to continued pricing pressure on commodity related products 
volumes decreased approximately compared to the prior year reflecting the decreased demand during the second half of fiscal advanced component sales include and of tantalum advanced component sales and and of ceramic advanced component sales during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in kdp and kss resale sales  excluding kec resale connectors  is attributable to sales of kss crystal components of approximately million resulting from our april  acquisition of kss  in addition to higher sales volumes of approximately  excluding additional volumes from the kss acquisition 
the impact of the increased volumes was partially offset by lower average selling prices due to a larger mix of small case parts 
connector sales  including kec resale connectors  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in connector sales was primarily attributable to new programs that came on line during the year  particularly in the automotive market 
our sales to independent electronic component distributor customers represented of total sales for the fiscal year ended march   compared to for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease reflects the impact of distributors lowering inventory levels during the second half of fiscal our sales to distributors involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs and price concessions for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales 
we record an estimated sales allowance for ship and debit and stock rotation at the time of sale based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
charges for ship and debit and stock rotation were million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to charges of million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  we had remaining allowances for ship and debit and stock rotation of million and million at march  and  respectively 
we recognize liabilities for price concession at the time the concession is offered to the distributor 
charges for price concessions for the fiscal year ended march  were insignificant  compared to charges of million  or of gross sales  for the fiscal year ended march  geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales increased  and  in the americas  europe and asia  respectively 
when compared to the same period last year  reported sales in us dollars for europe reflect a favorable currency impact of approximately million resulting from the weakness of the us dollar relative to most european currencies 
unit sales volumes increased in asia  europe was relatively unchanged and there was a decline in the americas compared to the same period last year reflecting the continued shift of customer production to the asian region 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  results for the fiscal year ended march  included a materials charge of million recorded during the second quarter for the write down of tantalum materials and future tantalum purchase commitments 
during the fiscal year ended march   overall material usage decreased million due to lower manufacturing volumes  lower tantalum material costs resulting from the write down of tantalum materials in the prior year and the purchase of additional material at market prices 
labor cost increased million primarily due to higher fringe benefit costs 
additionally  operating expenses declined million as a result of overall cost reductions of million and lower depreciation of million due to lower capital spending in recent years 
additionally  included in the increases and decreases discussed above are the negative effects of foreign exchange resulting from the weakness of the us dollar that resulted in an increase in reported costs of sales for the fiscal year ended march  of approximately million compared to the same period in the prior year 
we continue to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and to incur additional costs associated with the transfer of manufacturing operations to lower cost areas in china  malaysia  el salvador and the czech republic from facilities in the americas and europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended march  direct selling expenses increased million primarily due to higher sales commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives 
labor and fringe benefit costs increased million as a result of our investment in additional marketing resources due to the kss acquisition and higher fringe benefit costs 
other general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  primarily due to the costs of implementing the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  partially offset by million from the reversal of bad debt allowances 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new and maintaining existing products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses declined million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in research and development expenses was partially due to the transfer from development to production of certain new products 
engineering expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in engineering expenses is due to the development of manufacturing processes for new products and product enhancements 
the costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  in fiscal  the loss from operations included a materials charge of million and restructuring expenses of million 
for additional information on restructuring charges see the discussion below and note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
other income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily due to higher interest income resulting from improved rates of return on higher average balances of invested cash and securities  in addition to a million gain on the sale of a previously closed facility in taiwan 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was as we realized increased tax benefits resulting from operating losses for certain european and asian operations due to higher net income 
in addition  we reversed million of valuation allowances related to operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions as a result of improved current and expected future profitability in those jurisdictions 
we provide allowances against future tax benefits where there is a greater likelihood of not realizing the future tax benefits of net operating losses than of realizing them 
this compares to an effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march  as tax benefits for certain european and asian operations were offset by valuation allowances recorded 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
historically  the company has satisfied its liquidity requirements through funds from operations and investment income from cash and investments in securities 
as of march   we had a current ratio of to  million of cash  cash equivalents and investments in securities   million of stockholders equity and no debt 
net cash from operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in fiscal is primarily the result of decreases in net working capital 
purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures related to expanding the production capabilities of the passive component and connector product lines  expanding production capacity in lower cost regions such as china  malaysia  el salvador and the czech republic  as well as the implementation of lower cost manufacturing processes 
we continue to add additional capacity for advanced and specialty passive component and connector products and expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million in fiscal the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end market demand 
the majority of our funding is internally generated through operations and investment income from cash and investments in securities 
based on our financial condition as of march   we believe that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and investment income from cash and investment securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  environmental clean up costs  research  development and engineering expenses  and any dividend payments or stock repurchases to be made during the upcoming year 
while changes in customer demand have an impact on our future cash requirements  changes in those requirements are mitigated by our ability to adjust manufacturing capabilities to meet increases or decreases in customer demand 
additionally  we do not anticipate any significant changes in our ability to generate or meet our liquidity needs in the long term 
in fiscal  and  dividends of million  million and million  respectively  were paid to stockholders 
on april   the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market 
also  on october   the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
as of march   there were  shares that may yet be purchased under this program 
we purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal   shares at a cost of million during fiscal and  shares at a cost of million during fiscal the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes 
at march   we had contractual obligations for the acquisition or construction of plant and equipment aggregating approximately million 
we make contributions to our us and international defined benefit plans as required under various pension funding regulations 
we made contributions of million to our defined benefit plans during the year ended march  and estimate that we will make contributions of approximately million during the next fiscal year ending march  we have unfunded pension liabilities of approximately million related to these defined benefit pension plans at march  we are a lessee under long term operating leases primarily for office space  plant and equipment 
future minimum lease commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of march   were approximately million 
from time to time we enter into delivery contracts with selected suppliers for certain metals used in our production processes 
the delivery contracts represent routine purchase orders for delivery within three months and payment is due upon receipt 
as of march   we did not have any of these delivery contracts outstanding 
we are involved in disputes  warranty and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  we believe  based upon a review with legal counsel  that none of these proceedings will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  we cannot be certain if the eventual outcome and any adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time may harm our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party in state and federal administrative proceedings seeking contribution for costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at various waste disposal and operating sites 
in addition  we operate on sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities prior to the start of operations by avx 
even though we have been indemnified for such environmental matters  regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues 
once it becomes probable that the company will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated  the company establishes reserves or adjusts its reserve for its projected share of these costs 
a separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs 
management believes that its reserves for current environmental activities of approximately million are adequate 
actual costs may vary from these estimated reserves  but such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the company has the following contractual obligations and commitments as of march  as noted below 
less than more than contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years operating leases at march   we had contractual obligations for the acquisition or construction of plant and equipment aggregating approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended march   we made contributions of million to company sponsored retirement savings plans 
our contributions are partially based on employee contributions as a percentage of their salaries 
certain contributions by the company are discretionary and are determined by the board of directors each year 
we expect that our contributions for the year ending march  will be approximately the same as in fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   we made contributions of million to our us defined benefit plan and million to our international defined benefit plans 
these contributions are based on a percentage of pensionable wages or to satisfy funding requirements 
we expect that our contributions for the fiscal year ending march  will be approximately million for our international defined benefit plans 
there are no plans to contribute to our us defined benefit plan during fiscal based on current actuarial computations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  restructuring costs  income taxes and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our accounting policies and disclosure practices 
in management s opinion  the critical accounting policies and estimates  as defined below  are more complex in nature and require a higher degree of judgment than the remainder of our accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition all of our products are built to specification and tested by avx for adherence to such specification before shipment to customers 
we ship products to customers based upon firm orders 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
we recognize revenue when the sales process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of an agreement of sale  there is a fixed or determinable selling price  title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectability is reasonably assured 
estimates used in determining sales allowance programs described below are subject to the volatilities of the market place 
this includes  but is not limited to  changes in economic conditions  pricing changes  product demand  inventory levels in the supply chain  the effects of technological change  and other variables that might result in changes to our estimates 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
returns returns are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
sales revenue and cost of sales reported in the income statement are reduced to reflect estimated returns 
we record an estimated sales allowance for returns at the time of sale based on using historical trends  current pricing and volume information  other market specific information and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
the amount accrued reflects the return of value of the customer s inventory 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments 
we believe that they enable us to make reliable estimates of future returns 
our actual results approximate our estimates 
when the product is returned and verified  the customer is given credit against their accounts receivable 
distribution programs a portion of our sales are to independent electronic component distributor customers  which are subject to various distributor sales programs 
we report provisions for distributor allowances in connection with such sales programs as a reduction in revenue and report distributor allowances in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
for the distribution programs described below  we do not track the individual units that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  which would allow us to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates for each program 
distributor stock rotation program stock rotation is a program whereby distributor customers are allowed to return for credit qualified inventory  semi annually  equal to a certain percentage  primarily limited to of the previous six months net sales 
in accordance with sfas  we record an estimated sales allowance for stock rotation at the time of sale based on a percentage of distributor sales using historical trends  current pricing and volume information  other market specific information and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments 
we believe that they enable us to make reliable estimates of future returns under the stock rotation program 
our actual results approximate our estimates 
when the product is returned and verified  the distributor is given credit against their accounts receivable 
distributor ship from stock and debit program ship from stock and debit ship and debit is a program designed to assist distributor customers in meeting competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end customers 
ship and debit requires a request from the distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part for a customer sale to be shipped from the distributor s stock 
ship and debit authorizations may cover current and future distributor activity for a specific part for sale to their customer 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
topic  revenue recognition  at the time we record sales to the distributors  we provide an allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related to such sales since it is probable that such sales to distributors will result in ship and debit activity 
in accordance with sfas  we record an estimated sales allowance based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers  and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments 
we believe that they enable us to make reliable estimates of future credits under the ship and debit program 
our actual results approximate our estimates 
at the time the distributor ships the part from stock  the distributor debits us for the authorized pricing adjustment 
distributor price concession distributors may be granted price concessions based on the difference in the price paid for the inventory on hand at the distributor and a reduction by avx in sales prices quoted for our products book prices 
since many of our independent electronic component distributor customers have already entered into special pricing arrangements volume pricing arrangements for their substantial purchases of products  it is not probable that we will provide such price concessions 
since it is not probable when we ship products to our customers that they will demand and or that we will grant concessions on those sales  we account for such concessions in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf 
at the time of authorization  sales allowances are recorded at the maximum level for the difference in price of the inventory on hand at the distributor and our revised book price 
when the price concession is authorized the distributor is given credit against their accounts receivable 
inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to make certain assumptions and judgments to estimate net realizable value 
inventories are adjusted for estimates of obsolescence or written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
we determine the cost of raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market realizable value in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
arb 
arb requires that inventory be valued at its market value where there is evidence that the utility of goods will be less than cost and that such write down should occur in the current period 
accordingly  at the end of each period we evaluate our inventory and adjust to net realizable value the carrying value and excess quantities 
we calculate the value of slow moving finished goods inventory based on historical usage  customer forecasts received from the marketing and sales personnel  customer backlog  certain date code restrictions and general market conditions 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted and excess quantities are scrapped for technology changes  customer backlog and forecast changes  demand increases and decreases  market directional shifts  and obsolescence and aging 
in addition to finished goods  we apply these principles to raw materials and work in process inventories 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our tax assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we also record a provision for certain international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation  when needed 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to challenges from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other changing facts and circumstances may impact the company s ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
management believes that any potential tax exposures have been sufficiently provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to adjust tax accounts  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
pension assumptions pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in such cases  the differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are amortized over future periods 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the united states and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate 
based on our periodic review of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities  we believe that our operations currently comply  in all material respects  with all of these laws and regulations 
regarding sites identified by the epa at which remediation is required  our ultimate liability in connection with environmental claims will depend on many factors  including our volumetric share of non environmentally safe waste  the total cost of remediation and the financial viability of other companies having liability 
additionally  we operate on sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities prior to the start of operations by avx 
even though we have been indemnified for such environmental matters  regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues 
once it becomes probable that the company will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated  the company establishes reserves or adjusts its reserve for its projected share of these costs 
a separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs 
our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries  which are not expected to be significant  but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites 
summary of restructuring activities the company recorded million of restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended march  this total includes million of charges for programs initiated in fiscal year and million of charges for programs initiated in fiscal year the million of restructuring charges initiated in fiscal year were comprised of million for employee separation costs covering approximately production  technical  administrative and support employees in all geographic regions  million for long lived asset impairment write downs of building and equipment at closed facilities in france and taiwan to fair market value based on estimated market price  and million related primarily to current asset write offs and other facility closure costs in france  taiwan and mexico 
all asset impairment charges were related to the passive component reportable segment 
as of march   all of the related positions have been eliminated and million of the severance costs has been paid 
the remaining workforce reduction accrual of million and facility closure costs of approximately million are expected to be paid within the next twenty four months 
during the fiscal year ended march  severance and facility cost estimates were decreased by million and severance costs estimates were reduced by million due to changes in estimated future obligations 
activity related to these costs is as follows long lived other asset facility workforce impairment closure reductions write down costs total restructuring expense utilized balance at march  utilized changes in estimate balance at march  utilized balance at march  recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued interpretation no

sfas also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb opinion no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle

the company acquired certain sales and marketing subsidiaries from kss  a wholly owned subsidiary of kyocera  effective april  for million 
the purchase was accounted for under the purchase accounting method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
in august  the company sold a portion of the assets acquired that were associated with certain japanese customers in asia transferred to kyocera asia pacific ltd  a subsidiary of kyocera  for million 
this resulted in an adjustment to the purchase price 
as a result of the above transaction  the purchase price of the kss acquisition  as adjusted  of million was based on million of purchased net assets and million of excess purchase price over kyocera s basis  which was recorded as a decrease in equity as required for entities under common control 
the results of operations related to this acquisition are included in the accompanying financial statements beginning april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our european sales  which accounted for approximately of fiscal sales  are denominated in local  us and japanese currencies  while those in north america and asia generally are denominated in us dollars 
also  certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in europe  asia  mexico and central and south america 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and cash flow 
in order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates  we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange gains and losses on foreign currency hedge contracts have been immaterial during the periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
as of march   the fair market value of the company s currency derivative portfolio was approximately million based on quoted market prices 
approximately million of this fair value relates to instruments that will be utilized in fiscal a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to currency price risk 
based on the company s derivative portfolio as of march   a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in the hedged currencies against the us dollar  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  could have resulted in a net loss before income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
materials we are at risk to fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture our products  primarily tantalum  but also palladium  platinum  silver and copper 
tantalum powder and wire are principle materials used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products 
these materials may be purchased under contracts with suppliers from various parts of the world at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment and variations in the market 
the average market price for our tantalum powder and wire raw materials was approximately per pound at march  the tantalum required to manufacture our products has generally been available in sufficient quantity 
the limited number of tantalum material suppliers has led to higher prices during periods of increased demand 
during a period of significantly increased demand in fiscal  we entered into a long term supply agreement for a portion of our anticipated tantalum requirements 
as a result of the cost of tantalum materials under this now expired contract and the decline in selling prices for tantalum products  in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of million for the write down of our then current tantalum raw materials and work in process inventories and future material purchase commitments 
the related long term supply contract expired in december and we have no remaining purchase commitments related to this contract
