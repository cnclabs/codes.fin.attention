in the past  our operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
overview we design  manufacture and market radio frequency  or rf  modules that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high frequency signals in telecommunication networks  defense electronics and homeland security systems 
our rf modules are typically used in high frequency applications and include integrated transceivers  amplifiers  synthesizers  oscillators  up and down converters  frequency multipliers and microwave switch arrays 
markets and growth strategy telecommunication network market 
most of our rf modules are deployed in telecommunication networks 
our target customers for these applications are telecommunication network original equipment manufacturers and systems integrators  collectively referred to in this report as telecom oems 
telecom oems provide the wireless equipment used by service providers to deliver voice  data and video services to businesses and consumers 
from to  we experienced growth of in our telecommunications related revenues 
we benefited both from increased demand experienced by our customers and by capturing a greater share of our customers overall high frequency rf transceiver business 
telecom oems that purchased our products accounted for of our total revenues during additionally  we believe the demand for microwave radios and the transceiver modules used to build them is increasing 
as service providers deploy more cellular base stations to serve their growing subscriber base and upgrade existing facilities  they will require more microwave radio links for cellular backhaul 
we believe this projected increased demand is also driven by growth of wireless telephony in developing nations  increase in data sensitive cellular traffic  deployment of third generation  or g  networks and the introduction of other high capacity data only telecommunication networks 
defense electronics and homeland security system markets 
our rf modules are also designed into various applications outside of the telecommunication network market  including defense electronics and homeland security systems 
our target customers in the defense electronics market include defense systems integrators and their subcontractors that design aerospace systems  defense systems  weapons and electronics platforms for domestic and foreign defense customers 
our target customers in the homeland security market include those customers that are taking advantage of the properties of high frequency rf to create new capabilities designed to detect security threats 

table of contents from to  we experienced growth of over in our defense and homeland security related revenue as the defense related market demand continued to be strong  we aggressively pursued opportunities and we benefited from a full year of revenue from jca technology  inc jca  which we acquired in july revenues from our defense and homeland security business accounted for approximately of our total revenues in we also believe the demand for high frequency rf modules within various defense electronics and homeland security systems is increasing 
we are seeing increased demand in defense electronics systems as high frequency rf modules are being used in sophisticated radar systems  electronic warfare systems  intelligent battlefield systems and high capacity communication systems 
due to the need for greater resolution  more comprehensive real time information and better communication on the battlefield the united states military s demand for high frequency rf modules in the defense electronics market is growing 
similarly  the global escalation of terrorist and insurgency threats is resulting in increased governmental and private concern over providing adequate security measures 
many new  more capable systems are utilizing high frequency rf signals for various detection and imaging systems applied to threats of violence 
growth through acquisitions 
since our initial public offering in october  we have acquired and integrated five businesses or product lines 
as a result of these transactions  we have increased our revenues and market share  broadened our product portfolio  diversified our customer base  gained expertise outside our core telecommunication network market and added key members to our staff 
we believe the consolidation of high frequency rf module suppliers will continue and will provide us additional opportunities for attractive acquisitions 
it is our intent to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that will further strengthen our competitive position and revenue growth as appropriate 
improvement in cost structure over the past five years  we have reduced our costs dramatically and shifted many of our remaining costs from fixed to variable costs by consolidating our manufacturing operations  redesigning our products for cost reductions and improved manufacturability  streamlining our inventory management processes and reducing headcount 
in  we consolidated our three domestic manufacturing facilities into a single manufacturing facility in diamond springs  california  resulting in lower personnel and facilities costs 
in  we began implementing a plan to move most of our high volume manufacturing to a lower cost offshore contract manufacturer 
since that time  we increased the proportion of our revenues attributable to products manufactured offshore from approximately in to over in as a result  our cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenue have gone from in to in our remaining domestic manufacturing operations are now used primarily for our defense electronics products  which are required to be produced in the united states  and telecommunications and homeland security products that are produced in low volumes or require a high degree of technical support during their initial production 
we maintain the ability to manufacture products in high volumes in diamond springs  california as needed 
to the extent sales of our defense electronics products increase  we intend to manufacture those products in our existing domestic manufacturing facility or to employ a qualified united states contract manufacturer 
seasonality in the past  our operating results have reflected lower revenues in the first and third calendar quarters due to seasonality in the telecommunication network market 
revenues attributable to telecom oems typically have contracted in the first quarter due to delays in purchasing resulting from wireless carriers budgeting processes 
the third quarter generally has been slow in our telecommunication network market as many of our european telecom oem customers shut down their factories for a portion of the summer months 
the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter as the wireless carriers expend their remaining capital budgets for the year 
however  we did not experience this seasonality in  and we cannot be certain what seasonal factors  if any  will impact our revenues in the future or the extent of such potential fluctuations 

table of contents critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  asset impairments  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  below 
revenue recognition our primary customers are telecom oems and defense and homeland security systems integrators that incorporate our products into their systems 
we recognize product revenues at the time title passes  which is generally upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location  and persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues under development contracts are generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis  using project hours as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenues 
revenues attributable to development fees accounted for of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in the costs incurred under these development agreements are included in research and development expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our reserves  which were  at december  and  at december   historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our selling  general and administrative expenses would increase 
warranty reserves we generally offer a one year to two year warranty on all of our products 
we record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product revenues the amount of such costs at the time revenues are recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
at december  and our warranty reserves were million and million  respectively 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes review of materials usage  market conditions and product life cycles and an analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand and market conditions 
we reserve for inventories that are 
table of contents considered excess or obsolete 
we adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of product revenues  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them 
deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we have recorded a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
long lived assets we periodically review our property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenues and expense growth rates  the estimated royalty rates used for the valuation of acquired tradenames  and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between the intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the valuation of the intangible assets is based on an income approach methodology that values the intangible assets based on the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life discounted to its present value utilizing an appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the carrying value of goodwill was million and the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets was million 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
to the extent the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge to income is recorded 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of september  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
we have determined that no events have occurred from that date through december  that would require anupdated analysis 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of potential impairment exist 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results

product revenues are attributable to sales of our rf modules 
we generate development fees by developing product prototypes and custom products pursuant to development agreements that provide for payment of a portion of our research and development or other expenses 
we typically enter into a development contract only if we perceive it to generate a significant opportunity for substantial sales of our rf modules 
we expect to enter into more development contracts in the future as we seek to further penetrate the defense electronics market  where development contracts are customary  but we do not expect development fees to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
product revenues increased substantially from to as a result of increased demand from both our telecommunications customers and our defense and homeland security system customers  despite pricing pressure resulting in a average unit price reduction for our telecommunication products in compared to during revenues from our telecom oem customers comprised of our total revenues compared with 
table of contents in revenues from our defense and homeland security and other customers were of our total revenues compared with in telecommunications related revenues increased from as a result of increased demand experienced by our customers and by capturing a greater share of our customers overall transceiver business 
during  we increased our penetration at siemens and nera as they began outsourcing more of their transceiver production 
our defense and homeland security and other revenues increased over from as the defense related market demand continued to be strong  we aggressively pursued opportunities and we benefited from a full year of revenues from jca  which we acquired in july the increase in development fees from to was attributable to increased development of custom designed products for new and existing customers for both our telecommunications customers and our defense and homeland security customers 
based on our knowledge of our customers and overall market trends  we anticipate increased demand for our products during we will also continue to emphasize a strategy of growth and diversification in non telecommunication network markets 
however  because the markets we serve are difficult to predict and the economic recovery has been inconsistent  we cannot assure you that a similar revenue growth rate will be realized during the electronic component industry is experiencing pressure to reduce prices and we believe that we will continue to face similar pressure from our customers during cost of product revenues year ended december  change in thousands cost of product revenues percentage of revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of costs of direct materials and labor used to assemble and test our products  equipment depreciation  costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance  and manufacturing engineering  costs associated with maintaining our manufacturing facilities  fees paid to our offshore manufacturer  expenses associated with excess or obsolete inventory  and costs associated with warranty returns offset by the benefit of usage of materials that were previously written off 
during  the cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year as an increase in our direct materials cost as a percentage of revenue was offset by the benefit of increased absorption of our overhead costs due to increased overall revenue during the year 
the increase in our direct materials cost as a greater portion of our revenues during was related to transceiver modules that we produced based on our customers designs 
our plan is to redesign our customers existing transceivers to lower material costs in the future 
the cost of product revenues was favorably impacted by the utilization of inventory that was previously written off amounting to approximately  during as compared to  during we intend to continue to focus on reducing the cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues through the introduction of new designs and technology and further improvements to our offshore manufacturing processes

these pricing decreases were offset by increased product volumes from some of our larger customers  sales of new products for existing customers  the addition of new customers and the addition of product revenues attributable to jca  which we acquired in july the decrease in development fees is attributable to fewer customers reimbursing us for the development of their customized products 
cost of product revenues year ended december  change in thousands cost of product revenues percentage of revenues the decrease in cost of product revenues was primarily attributable to the reversal of million in excess warranty accrual  the reversal of a  charge to cost of product revenues for a liability that was settled during the first quarter of  the use of redesigned products and semiconductors  resulting in reduced use of expensive semiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide  lower prices we negotiated with velocium for semiconductor processing  and increased offshore manufacturing at a lower cost 
the cost of product revenues was also reduced by the use of  of inventory that was previously written off 
research and development expenses year ended december  change in thousands research and development expenses percentage of revenues the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the research and development expenses incurred by added headcount from jca  which we acquired in the third quarter of  of  and increased project and consulting expenses for development programs of  offset in part by  of decreased depreciation and facilities costs resulting from the sale and leaseback of our diamond springs  california manufacturing facility and the relocation of our sunnyvale  california headquarters

the sales tax was assessed in the third quarter of and was related to equipment that had been fully depreciated or impaired 
during  we evaluated the carrying value of the long lived assets used in our manufacturing process 
as we moved more of our production to our offshore contract manufacturer  we did not need as much manufacturing equipment  and took an impairment charge of million for excess manufacturing equipment 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated salvage value of the equipment 
in  we also recorded an additional charge of  to reduce the carrying value of engineering equipment based on the amounts by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their fair value 
our estimate of the fair value of the assets was based on sales prices of similar equipment 
amortization of deferred stock compensation year ended december  change in thousands amortization of deferred stock compensation the decrease in amortization of deferred stock compensation was related to the timing of the termination of employees with deferred compensation associated with their stock options and the effects of the graded vested method of amortization  which accelerates the amortization of deferred compensation

we believe that our existing cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next months and the foreseeable future thereafter 
however  additional financing may be required to fund acquisitions 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
additional capital may not be available at all  or may only be available on terms unfavorable to us 
with the exception of operating leases discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements  we have not established or invested in any variable interest entities  we do not have any unconditional purchase obligations  nor do we have non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures 
we have not guaranteed the debt or obligations of other entities or entered into options on non financial assets

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities 
as of december   all of our investments in our portfolio were classified as cash equivalents or short term investments and consisted primarily of commercial paper and government securities 
due to the generally short duration of these investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce interest income 
currently  all sales to international customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly we are not exposed to foreign currency rate risks in connection with these sales 
however  a strengthening dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and thereby lead to a decrease in revenues attributable to international customers
