foreign sales increased in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment from the prior fiscal year and in the fluid handling equipment segment from the prior fiscal year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million or 
the increase in net income was principally related to higher sales volumes in both operating segments  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in the effective tax rate relating to research and development tax credits  of which million related to the three year period ended january  the gross margin for the fiscal year ended january  was compared with for the same period in the prior year 
selling expense was million for the fiscal year ended january   an increase of million over the prior year

general and administrative expense was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was for the fiscal year ended january  compared with for the prior fiscal year 
this increase is principally related to higher management incentive program expenses  payroll and health care costs  combined with severance costs related to the relocation of our sethco division and consulting fees relating to an analysis of the company s research and development activities over the four year period ended january  
index interest expense was approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease was due principally to a reduction of existing long term debt 
other income  net  was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared with million in the prior year 
this change is related to higher interest income earned on cash on hand  combined with a reduction in charges incurred in defending and settling allegations that products sold by one of the company s divisions infringed a competitor s intellectual property rights 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended january  compared with for the fiscal year ended january  this decrease was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits for research and development credits for the current fiscal year ended january  and the prior three fiscal years ended january  during the fiscal year ended january   the company undertook a comprehensive review  for income tax purposes  of its classification of research and development activities which resulted in research and development tax credit benefits amounting to million  of which million related to the fiscal year ended january  and million related to the three year period ended january  fye vs fye net sales for the fiscal year ended january  were million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million 
sales in the fluid handling equipment segment were million or higher than the fiscal year ended january  sales in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment were million or lower than the fiscal year ended january  the decreased sales in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment have been adversely impacted by an overall softness in the higher dollar capital equipment and systems markets  combined with atypical customer delays in issuing expected purchase orders for several large dollar projects 
foreign sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended january   compared with million for the same period last year  an increase 
foreign sales increased in the fluid handling equipment segment from the prior fiscal year  and the product recovery pollution control equipment segment foreign sales were slightly lower than the prior fiscal year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared with million for the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million 
the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the decreased sales in the product recovery pollution control segment  as discussed above  and by a decrease in gross margin  as discussed below 
the gross margin for the fiscal year ended january  was compared with for the same period in the prior year due to lower gross margins experienced in both operating segments 
the decrease in gross margin is principally due to product mix  competitive pricing pressures  and higher raw material and in bound freight costs  combined with the profit erosion sustained on a product recovery pollution control project which reduced our net income by approximately  or of the overall reduction in the gross margin for the fiscal year 
selling expense was million for the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million over the prior year

interest expense was approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended january  and other income  net  was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared with other expense  net  of million in the prior year 
this change is principally related to a reduction in legal expenses incurred in defending against allegations that products sold by one of the company s divisions infringed a competitor s intellectual property rights 
we settled this case in february neither the settlement nor the legal fees incurred after january  were material in the fiscal year ended january  the effective tax rate was for each of the fiscal years ended january  and 
index liquidity the company s cash and cash equivalents were million on january  compared with million on january   a decrease of million 
this decrease is the net result of the positive cash flows provided by operating activities of million  the proceeds from new borrowings totaling million and the exercise of stock options amounting to million  offset by payments of the quarterly cash dividends amounting to million  the purchase of treasury shares amounting to million  payments on long term debt totaling million and investment in property and equipment amounting to million 
the company s cash flows from operating activities are influenced  in part  by the timing of shipments and negotiated standard payment terms  including retention associated with major projects  as well as other factors including changes in inventories and accounts receivable 
accounts receivable  net were million on january   an increase of million compared with the prior fiscal year 
in addition to changes in sales volume  the timing and size of shipments and retainage on contracts  especially in the product recovery pollution control equipment segment  will  among other factors  influence accounts receivable balances at any point in time 
inventories totaled million on january   an increase of million compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to inventory purchased in the fiscal year ended january  for projects which are expected to ship in the fiscal year ended january  inventory balances fluctuate depending on market demand and on the timing and size of shipments  especially when major systems and contracts are involved 
current liabilities amounted to million on january  compared with million on january   an increase of million 
an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and customers advances accounted for this increase 
the company has consistently maintained a high current ratio and maintains a domestic and foreign line of credit totaling million which are available for working capital purposes 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company borrowed million on a low interest foreign line of credit to finance an expansion and renovation of its mefiag bv facility 
cash flows  in general  have exceeded the current needs of the company 
the company presently foresees no change in this situation in the immediate future 
as of january  and january   working capital was million and million  respectively  and the current ratio was and  respectively 
capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended january  amounted to million compared with million in the fiscal year ended january   a decrease of million 
this decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due principally to i the increase in accounts receivable and ii inventory  which were offset by i the increase in net income  ii customers advances and iii accounts payable and accrued expenses  which includes an additional million contribution to the defined benefit plans  in addition to required contributions of  cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  amounted to million compared with million during the fiscal year ended january  the increase in investing activities is partially due to capital expenses incurred in connection with an expansion of the company s telford  pennsylvania facility  as to which the company had incurred costs of million for the fiscal year ended january  out of an expected total project cost of million 
this expansion is required to accommodate the relocation of the sethco division from hauppauge  new york to the telford  pennsylvania facility 
the costs associated with this relocation did not materially impact the financial results of the company for the fiscal year ended january  we expect to realize improvement in profitability from this action commencing in the fiscal year ending january  with continuous improvements possible in the following fiscal years 
in addition  the increase in investing activities was due to an expansion and renovation of our mefiag bv facility in heerenveen  the netherlands  in which the company has incurred costs of million for the fiscal year ended january  out of an expected total project cost of million 
this expansion is required to maintain the increased growth of mefiag bv the balance of the increase is due to the company s planned capital expenditures in the two operating segments during the year 
consistent with past practices  the company intends to continue to invest in new product development programs and to make capital expenditures to support the ongoing operations during the coming year 
the company expects to finance all routine capital expenditure requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
financing activities for both fiscal years ended january  and used million of available resources

the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

on october   the company s annual measurement date  the accumulated benefit obligation related to the company s pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets such excess is referred to as an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
this difference is due to the decline in the market value of assets in the company s non contributory defined benefit pension plan trust during the fiscal year ended january   combined with a reduction in the discount rate from to between the fiscal years ended january  and in connection with this difference  the company s minimum pension liability as of january  was  as part of our commitment to the future  the company expended million and million on research and development for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively

index recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r will require the fair value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period 
the statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
in april  the effective date for this standard was changed to require adoption of the standard at the beginning of the next fiscal year after june   or in our case  beginning with our fiscal year ending january  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard upon our current and our immediately prior fiscal years would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share on page accordingly  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method to have an impact on the financial reporting of our results of operations based upon our current policies and practices with respect to the granting of stock options  although we do not expect it to have an impact on our overall financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  which addresses the measurement of exchanges of non monetary assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which was previously provided by apb no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
specifies that a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin no 
requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the interpretation also clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin no 
also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin no 
is effective for the company with its fiscal year ended january  fin no 
has not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
the statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless impracticable to do so 
it also requires that a change in the depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted as a change in accounting estimate  effected by a change in accounting principle 
accounting for error corrections and accounting estimate changes will still be handled according to guidance in apb opinion  accounting changes  as carried forward in this pronouncement 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect adoption of this sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following the company s revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 

index property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  effective february   the company s unamortized goodwill balance is not being amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  it is being assessed at least annually for impairment 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense
