we consolidate the financial statements of all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest or where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
as of december   we owned non controlling interests in seven regional malls and three associated centers 
because major decisions such as the acquisition  sale or refinancing of principal partnership or joint venture assets must be approved by one or more of the other partners  we do not control these partnerships and joint ventures and  accordingly  account for these investments using the equity method 
we had two mall expansions  two open air shopping centers  one open air shopping center expansion  two associated centers  one community center  which is owned in a joint venture  and one community center expansion under construction as of december  the majority of our revenues are derived from leases with retail tenants and generally include minimum rents  percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes and reimbursements from tenants for expenditures related to property operating expenses  real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  as well as certain capital expenditures 
we also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at the properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize a premium value for the assets 
proceeds from such sales are generally used to reduce borrowings on our credit facilities

see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more thorough discussion of these transactions 
properties that were in operation for the entire period during and are referred to as the comparable properties in this section 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of million from the new properties and million from the comparable properties 
these increases were offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america in january the increase in revenues of the comparable properties was driven by our ability to maintain high occupancy levels while achieving a weighted average increase of in rents from both new leases and lease renewals for comparable small shop spaces  as well as an increase in percentage rents 
the increase in management  development and leasing fees of million was primarily attributable to management and leasing fees received from galileo america prior to the redemption of our interest in galileo america  plus an million acquisition fee received from galileo america that was related to galileo america s acquisition of an approximately billion portfolio of shopping center properties from new plan

this was offset by a decrease of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america in january the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from increases of million from the new properties and million from the comparable properties 
the increase attributable to the comparable properties is due to ongoing capital expenditures for renovations  expansions  tenant allowances and deferred maintenance 
general and administrative expenses increased million during severance packages for individuals affected by the sale of our management and advisory contracts with galileo america contributed million to the increase 
the remainder of the increase is related to additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and combined with annual compensation increases for existing personnel

the ten community centers included four community centers that were sold to galileo america in january  five community centers that were sold to a third party during march and one community center that was sold for a loss during the fourth quarter of other income and expenses interest expense increased million primarily due to the debt on the new properties  the refinancings that were completed on the comparable properties and an increase in variable interest rates

this was due to the mortgage loan that was placed on coastal grand myrtle beach in september  which is at a fixed interest rate that is higher than the previous variable rate loan 
discontinued operations for represent the operations of the six community centers we sold during as well as the operations of the two community centers that were classified as held for sale as of december  discontinued operations during reflect the results of two community centers that we sold during  as well as the results of the properties described in the previous sentence

we sold six additional community centers to galileo america in january since we had continuing involvement with these properties through our ownership interest in galileo america and our role as manager of the properties  the results of operations of these properties were not reflected in discontinued operations 
therefore  the year ended december  includes results of operations for these properties through the dates they were sold 
x effective january   we began to consolidate the results of operations of ppg venture i limited partnership  which owns two community centers and one associated center the ppg properties  as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement 
the ppg properties were accounted for as unconsolidated affiliates using the equity method of accounting prior to january  properties that were in operation for the entire period during and are referred to as the comparable properties in this section 
revenues the million increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of million from the new properties  million related to the ppg properties and million from the comparable properties 
these increases were offset by a reduction in revenues of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america in october and january the increase in revenues of the comparable properties was driven by our ability to maintain high occupancy levels  while achieving an increase of in rents from both new leases and lease renewals for comparable small shop spaces 
an increase in management and leasing fees of million received from galileo america was the primary contributor to the million increase in management  development and leasing fees 
the million increase in other revenues is primarily attributable to a growth in revenues that we receive from providing security and maintenance services to third parties 
operating expenses property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  increased as a result of increases of million from the new properties and million from the ppg properties  offset by decreases of million related to the community centers that were sold to galileo america and million in operating expenses of the comparable properties 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from increases of million from the new properties  million related to the ppg properties and million from the comparable properties 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million related to the community centers that we sold to galileo america in october and january the increase attributable to the comparable properties is due to ongoing capital expenditures for renovations  expansions  tenant allowances and deferred maintenance 
general and administrative expenses increased million during as a percentage of revenues  this was only a increase over the comparable amount 
general and administrative expenses were significantly impacted by an additional million of expenses in related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of state tax expenses also increased million as a result of our continued growth 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and combined with annual compensation increases for existing personnel 
we identified ten community centers and recorded a loss on impairment of real estate assets of million to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their respective estimated fair values based on estimates of the selling prices to be received from the sales of nine centers in one community center was sold for a loss during the fourth quarter of other income and expenses interest expense increased million primarily due to the debt on the new properties and the ppg properties  as well as the additional financings that were obtained on the comparable properties 
the increase was offset by a reduction in interest expense related to the galileo transaction as well as normal principal amortization 
the gain on sales of real estate assets of million in included million of gain related to the galileo transaction and million of gain on sales of seven outparcels at various properties 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million in as a result of our interest in galileo america and the opening of coastal grand myrtle beach in march we sold two community centers during for a gain on discontinued operations of million 
we sold one community center for a loss of million  which was included in loss on impairment of real estate assets 
operating income from discontinued operations decreased in because the properties were owned for a shorter period of time in than in  and because includes the operations of properties that were sold during operational review the shopping center business is  to some extent  seasonal in nature with tenants achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season  which results in higher percentage rent income in the fourth quarter 
additionally  the malls earn most of their short term rents during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year 
we classify our regional malls into two categories malls that have completed their initial lease up are referred to as stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease up phase and have not been open for three calendar years are referred to as non stabilized malls 
the non stabilized malls currently include parkway place in huntsville  al  which opened in october  coastal grand myrtle beach in myrtle beach  sc  which opened in march  imperial valley mall in el centro  ca  which opened in march  southaven towne center in southaven  ms  which opened in october  and gulf coast town center phase i in ft

liquidity and capital resources there was million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of december   an increase of million from december  cash flows from operations are used to fund short term liquidity and capital needs such as tenant construction allowances  capital expenditures and payments of dividends and distributions 
for longer term liquidity needs such as acquisitions  new developments  renovations and expansions  we typically rely on property specific mortgages which are generally non recourse  construction and term loans  revolving lines of credit  common stock  preferred stock  joint venture investments and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the operations of the new properties plus the acquisition fee earned in connection with galileo america s transaction with new plan

there is no limit to the offering price or number of shares that we may issue under this shelf registration statement 
we anticipate that the combination of equity and debt sources will  for the foreseeable future  provide adequate liquidity to continue our capital programs substantially as in the past and make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts 
our strategy is to maintain a conservative debt to total market capitalization ratio in order to enhance our access to the broadest range of capital markets  both public and private

represents the remaining balance to be incurred under construction contracts that had been entered into as of december   but were not complete 
the contracts are primarily for development  renovation and expansion of properties 
capital expenditures we expect to continue to have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business 
future development and acquisition activities will be undertaken as suitable opportunities arise 
we do not expect to pursue these activities unless adequate sources of financing are available and we can achieve satisfactory returns on our investments 
an annual capital expenditures budget is prepared for each property that is intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non recurring capital expenditures 
we believe that property operating cash flows  which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses  will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures

we have entered into a number of option agreements for the development of future regional malls and community centers 
except for the projects listed in the above table  we do not have any other material capital commitments

we expect to renovate seven malls during at a total estimated cost of million  which will be funded from operating cash flows and availability under our credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated affiliates we have ownership interests in eleven unconsolidated affiliates that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party x third parties may approach us with opportunities where they have obtained land and performed some pre development activities  but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition 
we enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment 
we typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property for a fee once the property is placed in operation 
x we determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in the property to a third party 
this provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth 
when we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a interest  it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the property  which provides us the ability to earn fees for management  leasing  development  financing and acquisition services provided to the joint venture 
guarantees we may issue guarantees on the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise 
this results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment  and in a higher return on our investment in the joint venture 
we may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty 
additionally  when we issue a guaranty  the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture 
as of december   we have guaranteed of the debt of parkway place lp the total amount outstanding at december   was million  of which we have guaranteed million 
the guaranty will expire when the related debt matures in june the company s guarantees and the related accounting are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion describes our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases 
certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable 
we receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements 
tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of to years and are recognized as revenue when billed 
we receive management  leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates 
management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues as defined in the management agreement and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period 
leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned 
development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate  our receivable  if any  is not subject to future subordination  and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset

real estate assets we capitalize predevelopment project costs paid to third parties 
all previously capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed 
once development of a project commences  all direct costs incurred to construct the project  including interest and real estate taxes  are capitalized 
additionally  certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the amount of time applicable personnel work on the development project 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
all acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
the purchase price is allocated to i tangible assets  consisting of land  buildings and improvements  as if vacant  and tenant improvements and ii identifiable intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of above and below market leases and in place leases 
we use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows  using appropriate discount rates  and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets 
liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired 
assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years for buildings  to years for certain improvements and to years for equipment and fixtures 
tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
lease related intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases 
the amortization of above and below market leases is recorded as an adjustment to minimum rental revenue  while the amortization of all other lease related intangibles is recorded as amortization expense 
any difference between the face value of the debt assumed and its fair value is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method 
carrying value of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value is charged to operations 
we recorded losses on the impairment of real estate assets of million and million in and  respectively  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no impairment charges in recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis  unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or the transactions lack commercial substance 
sfas no 
became effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods that began after june in december  the fasb released its final revised standard  sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
in april  the securities and exchange commission issued a staff accounting bulletin to modify the effective date so that sfas no 
r can be adopted beginning with the first interim reporting period of the next fiscal year beginning after june   instead of the first interim period beginning after june  we previously adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january  we will adopt sfas no 
r on january   using a modified prospective application 
we estimate that this will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense of approximately million and million during the years ending december  and  which represents the unamortized deferred compensation expense associated with all remaining stock options that were not vested as of december  in may  the fasb issued statement no 
entitled  accounting changes and error corrections  which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal year this statement addresses the retrospective application of such changes and corrections and we will follow the provision of this standard in the event of any future accounting changes 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf issue no 
provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls  and should consolidate  a limited partnership or a similar entity 
eitf issue no 
is effective after june   for all newly formed limited partnerships and for any pre existing limited partnerships that modify their partnership agreements after that date 
general partners of all other limited partnerships are required to apply the consensus no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  interaction of aicpa statement of position and eitf issue no 
the eitf acknowledged that the consensus in eitf issue no 
conflicts with certain aspects of statement of position sop  accounting for investments in real estate ventures 
the eitf agreed that the assessment of whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership should be consistent for all limited partnerships  irrespective of the industry within which the limited partnership operates 
accordingly  the guidance in sop was amended in fsp to be consistent with the guidance in eitf issue no 
the effective dates for this fsp are the same as those for eitf issue no 
described above 
we do not expect that the adoption of fsp will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
therefore  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under sfas no 
if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin permits  but does not require  restatement of interim financial information 
the provisions of fin are effective for reporting periods ending after december  in accordance with the transition provisions of fin  we recorded an asset of million and a liability of million related to conditional asset retirement obligations as of december  the difference between the amounts of the asset and liability of million was recognized as maintenance and repairs expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect us from the impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
we compute ffo as defined above by nareit less dividends on preferred stock 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
we believe that ffo provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time 
since values of well maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions  we believe that ffo enhances investors understanding of our operating performance 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our properties and interest rates  but also by our capital structure 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo increased in to million compared to million in the new properties generated of the growth in ffo  while consistently high portfolio occupancy  increases in rental rates from new and renewal leasing and increased recoveries of operating expenses at the comparable properties accounted for of the growth in ffo 
the remaining of growth is primarily attributable to the gain from the sale of the galileo america management contracts to new plan and the acquisition fee related to galileo america s acquisition of new plan s portfolio 
the reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common shareholders is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders    depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties    unconsolidated affiliates    discontinued operations  minority interest in earnings of operating partnership    gain on sales of operating real estate assets    minority investors share of depreciation and amortization    gain loss on discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets ffo    ffo applicable to our shareholders    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations 
our interest rate risk management policy requires that we use derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes only and that  if we do enter into a derivative financial instrument  the derivative financial instrument be entered into with only major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  and based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable rate debt at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual cash flows by approximately million and  after the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million 
based on our proportionate share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt at december   a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million  while a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million
