item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide an array of proprietary  value added products to a diverse customer base covering a broad spectrum of industries 
this strategic diversification means that demand for our products depends  in part  upon a wide range of general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
similar to and  during the company continued to benefit from a strong manufacturing economy and from significant military and defense spending 
as a result  the company experienced strong demand for its specialty products from various key markets including defense  wind power  heavy equipment  medical equipment  aerospace  and petrochemical 
table of contents processing 
in january  the company acquired purafil inc purafil for million 
purafil manufactures and distributes gas phase air filtration systems and media for industrial and commercial applications throughout the world  and is part of the company s other businesses for segment reporting purposes 
primarily because of the continuing strong manufacturing economy  and including the results of purafil  the company achieved increases in customer order levels in each quarter during compared to the prior year 
the total order book for was million  a percent increase over  and the total order book for was million  a percent increase over our year end backlog of million provides a firm foundation for operating performance in the company continues to focus on programs intended to reduce costs  improve capacity utilization  increase efficiencies  and grow market share and cash flow  thereby positioning the company to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted end markets  especially during a period of sustained economic growth 
in  the company continued a company wide six sigma effort and continued its investments in lean manufacturing and information systems to strengthen the company s operational excellence 
during the first half of  the company s operating margin was affected by higher material costs  including both higher raw material costs and the cost of outsourcing certain production processes associated with the ramp up phase of several new product programs in the military and wind power markets 
these higher costs were substantially offset late in the year by selling price and capacity increases initiated during the third quarter 
in july  we completed the sale of our power and data transmission products group for million cash  resulting in an after tax gain of million or per share on a diluted basis 
the operating results of the group  including the aforementioned gain on sale  have been reported as discontinued operations  and all prior period information has been restated 
the company performs periodic strategic reviews of its operating companies to assess their future prospects relative to the company s long term growth and profit goals 
based upon these reviews  management determined that owning the power and data transmission products group was not consistent with these goals 
the company s effective tax rate of percent reflects foreign tax and state tax benefits totaling million for tax audit settlements during the year related to deductions previously not recognized for financial reporting purposes  as well as the us federal tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction available for the first time under the american jobs creation act of maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy of the company 
in  the company issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due during  the company entered into an amended and restated agreement for its senior credit facility  replacing the company s previous million credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
also  in  the company completed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s current cash balances  the million revolving credit facility  the million shelf registration and other available financial resources enhance liquidity and provide additional financial strength to support the company s objectives  including strategic acquisitions 
as disclosed in item of this annual report  the company has concluded that its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  our independent registered public accounting firm s report on internal control over financial reporting is also included in item under the heading report of independent registered public accounting firm internal control 
expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance equaled million in  compared with million in the requirements of sarbanes oxley are ongoing  and we will incur additional compliance related costs in the future in our efforts to remain compliant 
in summary  the company would expect to continue to benefit from a favorable manufacturing economy  continued strong military and defense spending  the growth of the wind power industry  and the utilization of current liquidity levels in completing strategic acquisitions 
however  because many of these factors are external to the company  it is difficult to predict the specific impact they may have on the company s future operating results 
the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  as of january  the company does not expect the impact of adoption to be significant

specifically  the friction and motion control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million or percent compared to sales of million 
the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to various defense related markets of million  the wind power market of million  the heavy equipment market of million  and the medical equipment market of million 
also  sales of split roller bearings  used globally in various industrial markets  increased million compared to last year 
these increases were partially offset by reduced sales of custom engineered bearings to the specialty electronics manufacturing equipment market of million and to the machinery market of million  and by reduced sales to specialty ball markets of million 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
the small product line acquisition completed late last year contributed million to the sales increase 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  an increase of million  or percent from sales of million  as sales of new industrial seal products and industrial seal maintenance services increased million as a result of increased spending by refining and petrochemical plants for equipment upgrades and overhaul activities 
also  sales were affected by a work stoppage at the baltimore  maryland facility late in the year 
our other businesses achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
sales of million by a recent acquisition and million of additional sales of metal forming equipment were partially offset by reduced sales of certain liquid filtration products 
gross profit from continuing operations for equaled million or percent of sales as compared to million or percent of sales for compared to  gross margin for was negatively affected early in the year by a shift in product mix and increased material costs  particularly in our specialty bearings business 
higher material costs related to both higher prices for raw materials and to more production processes being outsourced during the start up phases of new product programs in the military and wind power markets 
during the third quarter of certain selling price increases were initiated  substantially offsetting the higher raw material costs  and capital equipment additions completed in the second half of the year have reduced the amount of outsourcing required 
these selling price and capacity increases had a positive affect on our fourth quarter gross margin and we expect that to continue into selling  general and administrative expenses of continuing operations totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for generally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of higher sales volume 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due to additional amortization costs associated primarily with recent acquisitions 
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar during  changes in exchange rates applicable to non functional currency assets and liabilities resulted in an exchange loss of million in compared to an exchange gain of million in  resulting in a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses when comparing to these increases

operating income from continuing operations equaled million during  compared to million in  with operating margins of percent and percent in and on a reporting segment basis  operating income from the friction and motion control products reporting segment was million during as compared to million during the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to the wind power  defense  heavy equipment and medical equipment markets  and of split roller bearing products used globally in various industrial markets 
the growth of operating income was affected by operating inefficiencies related to new programs for military and wind power applications and by higher material costs that were not offset by selling price and manufacturing capacity increases until late in the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in selling prices 
the sealing products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during operating income was positively impacted by increased sales of new industrial seal products and industrial maintenance services  but was unfavorably affected by higher material and energy costs 
operating income for also included the million favorable effect of certain reserve adjustments 
our other businesses contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during increased operating income from an acquisition completed in january was offset by a decrease in operating income generated from our liquid filtration products business 
operating income for included a million goodwill impairment loss 
in may  we issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
amortization of note issuance costs is recorded as a component of interest expense 
during both and  million of interest and amortization of issuance costs related to the notes was charged to interest expense 
we expect a similar amount to be charged to interest expense during as a result of higher investment interest rates and higher cash and cash equivalent balances  due in part to the sale of the power and data transmission products group  interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the effective tax rate for continuing operations for was percent compared to percent in the effective tax rate reflects reduced taxes on foreign earnings and remittances compared with last year  and additional deductions available for the first time under the american jobs creation act of in addition  the effective income tax rate reflects foreign tax and state tax benefits totaling million  and the effective income tax rate reflects state tax benefits totaling million  for tax audit settlements related to deductions previously not recognized for financial reporting purposes 
the effective tax rate also reflects the elimination of a million valuation allowance attributable to the expected utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that were previously not expected to be realized 
we expect the effective tax rate for continuing operations for to be approximately percent 
as was previously disclosed  beginning with the fourth quarter of  kaydon s diluted earnings per common share calculations reflect the provisions of the final consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf  the effects of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s contingent convertible senior subordinated notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the

these increases were partially offset by reduced sales to specialty ball markets of million 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
increased worldwide product demand from a variety of industrial markets contributed to million of the increase  while favorable foreign currency translation  primarily related to the strengthening of the euro  accounted for another million of the increase 
also  a small product line acquisition in the third quarter of contributed million to the sales increase 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  down million  or percent from sales of million  primarily as a result of a work stoppage at the company s baltimore maryland facility  which began on december  and was settled on january  our other businesses achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million  due primarily to higher sales prices on metal alloys caused by a pass through of higher raw material prices 
our gross profit from continuing operations equaled million or percent of sales in  as compared to million or percent of sales achieved in gross profit was positively impacted by increased sales  favorable product mix  inventory revaluations and six sigma cost reduction initiatives 
many of our products are high value added and have strong contribution margins  which causes our profit performance to be sensitive to sales volume and mix 
as previously reported  the gross profit includes a million favorable impact related to the settlement of a legal matter 
selling  general and administrative expenses of continuing operations totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for generally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of higher sales volume 
in addition  expenses in related to sarbanes oxley compliance increased million compared to  while costs related to acquisition initiatives in increased million compared to also included in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for is a million pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment loss

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies and legal costs we record loss contingencies as a liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting estimates related to loss contingencies and legal costs to be critical accounting estimates as contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and estimation of probable losses and costs to litigate requires forecasts that often depend on judgments from third party experts and are based on potential actions by other third parties such as plaintiffs  juries  and regulators 
to better understand this accounting policy and its historic impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding loss contingencies and legal costs 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we identify impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
table of contents including estimates for terminal value 
we utilize a percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that are compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  salary growth rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at september   the company calculated the cash flows represented by the projected benefit obligations of three pension plans constituting percent of the company s total projected benefit obligation 
these cash flows were discounted at corresponding interest rates derived from a hypothetical yield curve constructed using the top quartile of high rated aa or aa non callable bonds with at least million of par value outstanding 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
the discount rate applicable to the company s three largest pension plans was also used for two smaller pension plans and the company s postretirement benefits 
prior to using 
table of contents the yield curve approach  the discount rate assumptions used for the pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs in and and the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at september  were based on investment yields available on long term corporate bonds 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
inflation assumptions are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables 
the group annuity mortality table was used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at september  and the pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs in and the september  pension and postretirement benefit obligations are computed using the rp combined healthy mortality table  which is a more current table that is expected to better anticipate future experience 
the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions postretirement pension benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
to better understand this accounting policy and its historic impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding costs  obligations  and assumptions for employee pension and postretirement benefits 
contingent convertible senior subordinated notes in may of  we completed the sale of million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met including that our common stock has traded above for specified periods of time 
in october  the financial accounting standards board ratified the final consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf  the effects of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
the provisions are effective for reporting periods ending after december  accordingly  beginning with the second quarter of  prior period diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to adjust net income by adding back the after tax interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs  attributable to the notes and to increase total shares outstanding by the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires the company to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed for cash instead of converted into company common stock 
should this happen  
table of contents depending on other factors  tax payments may increase 
we believe that the impact the notes have on the accounting for our diluted earnings per share calculations  and tax related account balances as discussed above are critical to the understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations 
application of eitf has caused further dilution to our diluted earnings per share calculation  and redemption of the notes for cash may cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company

income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
our effective income tax rate reflects foreign tax and state benefits totaling million  and our effective income tax rate reflects state tax benefits totaling million  for tax audit settlements related to deductions previously not recognized for financial reporting purposes 
the effective income tax rate also reflects us income taxes on the remittance of certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries as dividends to the extent not offset by available foreign tax credits 
we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for would not have a material impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  and japan 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which many costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
