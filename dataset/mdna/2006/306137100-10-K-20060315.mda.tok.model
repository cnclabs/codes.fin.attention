investors are cautioned that any forward lookin g statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significan t risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially fro m those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussio n should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes t o those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview fiscal was a year of continued growth and profitability 
our revenue s for the full year increased to million from million in we ar e pleased that we were profitable for a full year for the first time 
as it has been in the past  our focus will continue to be on managing ou r business with a view towards long term success and growth 
in we continue d to invest in research and development and other areas to build on our momentum to design new products  and to enhance our existing products to position th e company for future growth 
we will continue to invest in these areas in an d we anticipate that our research and development and sales and marketing expense s will increase in to continue to create industry leading  cutting edge network storag e solutions  we hired additional software development engineers and qualit y assurance engineers 
these software engineers design and test the softwar e products that are or will be sold by our oem partners and resellers 
continuin g to deliver new and enhanced products to meet the demands of the storage marke t is necessary for us to remain competitive and to continue our growth 
it is important to our success that our products meet the needs of en d users and that our products are and are viewed by the market to be innovative 
in our products continued to receive recognition for thei r features  quality and innovation from several respected  independent  industr y publications and organizations 
this recognition helps us gain access t o additional customers and assists us in closing sales 
we also increased our sales force and our technical support team 
a n increased sales force should expand the market exposure for our products 
th e expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues fro m end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing to p notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to mak e sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely t o order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy wit h our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be more likely t o recommend our current products and less likely to consider other providers fo r future products 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the launch of our primevaul t disaster recovery  archiving and hosting services 
these services are based o n our ipstor and virtualtape library vtl software and provide a means for us t o leverage our successes with those products to increase our customer base t o include end users who do not have the resources either technical or financia l to undertake a full implementation of our products 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects continue t o be our sales pipeline  our ability to establish and expand relationships wit h key industry oems and resellers  sales by our oem partners  additional order s from resellers  growth in deferred revenue  re orders from existing customers and the growth of the overall market for storage solutions 
gross margins ar e also a key factor in evidencing the growth of our business 
our sales pipeline consists of inquiries from end users and reseller s for possible purchases of our products 
our overall sales pipeline steadil y increased for each quarter of compared with the same quarter in oem relationships are important to us for two main reasons 
first  sale s by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
second  having our product s selected by respected  established industry leaders signals to customers resellers and other potential oem partners that our products are qualit y products that add value to their enterprise 
before licensing software  oe m partners typically undertake broad reviews of many of the competing softwar e solutions available 
the choice of our products by major industry participant s validates both the design and the capabilities of the products and our produc t roadmaps 
overall  product licenses to oems accounted for approximately fort y percent of our revenues in two oem customers each accounted for over te n percent of our revenues 
we anticipate that oems will account for over fort y percent of our revenues in we expect that at least one oem will accoun t for at least ten percent of our revenues in accordingly  the loss of thi s customer would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  we signed a new agreement for our vtl product with a tier oem this oem released a solution using our vtl in the fourth quarter of due t o the timing of the royalty reports from this oem  the revenue will be recorded o n a one quarter lag 
as a result of this lag  we did not have any revenue fro m this oem in  but we expect to start generating revenue in in  w e signed a number of agreements with international oems for our ipstor  vtl an d iscsi storage server products 
one of these agreements is with a major i p networking solution provider based in hangzhou  china to offer turn key iscs i solutions 
we also renewed agreements with existing oem partners 
we wil l continue to seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
we do everything we can to assure that our products meet the needs of ou r oem partners and their customers 
however  we cannot control decisions by ou r oem partners to change their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sale s of products licensed by the oems from us 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers t o assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these reseller s typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  o r combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent o n satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers hav e wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning a s promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customer s are complaining about the level of support they are receiving from th e suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to thei r customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator o f our business prospects 
we saw growth in the sales by most of our significan t resellers in and expect that this growth will continue in we hav e established strong relationships with many premier resellers 
in  we signe d agreements with new resellers worldwide 
we also terminated relationships wit h resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products 
we wil l continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinu e relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts received attributabl e to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenu e is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for ou r products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreement s are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess o f one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our product s or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenanc e and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will no t renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenue s thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfactio n with our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased t o million as of december   compared with million as of decembe r  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in the level of re orders from existing end users of our products is anothe r measure of customer satisfaction 
information technology professionals will onl y order additional products and services for their companies if they determin e that the products have reduced total cost of ownership and have provided a goo d return on investment 
re orders are thus an indication that our products ar e delivering as promised and that our support is meeting the end user s needs 
i n  many end users ordered additional copies of our products  or additiona l products or ordered additional options 
if re orders decline  it would indicat e that future sales might also decline 
as the percentage of our revenues fro m oems increases  our ability to gauge re orders decreases because our oe m partners typically do not provide us with information identifying the end use r for each order 
consolidation in the network storage market had an adverse impact on ou r revenues in during  two of our oem partners were purchased by othe r companies 
in one case  the uncertainty caused by the impending purchase and th e subsequent consolidation of the businesses caused a loss of focus on sales b y the two companies 
in the other case  after the acquisition  the acquire r undertook a lengthy review of which solutions would be offered by the combine d entity 
this review caused a near halt in sales of solutions incorporating ou r product 
we are pleased that both acquirers have decided to continue to offe r solutions incorporating our products 
the storage solutions market continues to grow 
in addition to growt h based on demand for storage server consolidation and replication  there wa s growth in backup acceleration 
we expect each of these areas to continue growin g in we have new initiatives in the small medium business smb and smal l office home office soho markets 
we did not receive significant revenue fro m these markets in  but we believe that these non enterprise markets ar e another growth area for storage software 
in early  we signed an oe m agreement with a leading computer  networking and communications product s manufacturer to offer an entry level data storage and protection appliance powered by a version of ipstor optimized to run on a system on chip soc platform ipstor express  targeting the smb soho market 
the launch i s scheduled for the first quarter of it is too early to estimate whethe r revenues from these markets will be significant contributors to our revenues i n as we had anticipated  we saw the greatest increase in revenues from ou r virtualtape library software 
we expect this growth to continue  if no t accelerate  in  as our new oem continues it sales and as we introduc e additional features and functionality for the product 
the continued decline i n prices for disk storage  and the continuing need for rapid back up  disaste r recovery and regulatory compliance  should contribute to this growth 
market acceptance of ip based storage area networks  primarily usin g iscsi  continued in previously  most sans had been based on fibre channel however  this portion of the storage software market has not been a significan t contributor to our revenues 
our expectations regarding the size of the revenu e contribution from this market in were impacted negatively  in part  b y sales from our tier oem partner that were lower than we had anticipated 
i n  we plan to work with this partner to enhance the product line to help t o grow sales 
in addition  we have signed agreements with international oems t o market these products 
we plan to continue to tap into the growth in this marke t through sales of our products by other strategic partners 
another important measure of our business is gross margin 
among othe r things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
unlik e manufacturers of hardware  our incremental cost for each additional unit o f software licensed is a small percentage of the software license revenue 
thus our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
w e incur research and development expenses before the product is offered fo r licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineerin g and testing  but also include other items such as the cost of hardware an d software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sale s and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our gross margin increased on a full year basis to compared with in we believe this demonstrates that we were successful in our ability t o scale our business 
we are pleased with our ability to contain the increase of expenses i n we will continue to invest in infrastructure and personnel to maintain an d enhance our leading edge designs and to support our customers  but we wil l continue to do so in a controlled  cost effective manner 
one additional factor that we expect to continue to affect our revenues o n a quarterly  but not annual  basis  is the seasonality of the informatio n technology business 
historically  information technology spending has bee n higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewha t slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
our quarterl y results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterl y results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  beginnin g with the first quarter of  we will be required by statement of financia l accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  to expense the grant dat e fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation to employees an d non employees in our financial statements 
we are currently evaluating th e impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidate d financial statements  but there will be a negative impact on our reporte d results of operations 
notwithstanding this change to our financial statements we will continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in th e past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation t o our employees 
we believe that the opportunity to participate in the growth o f our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
for the management of our busines s and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results befor e stock option expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in makin g operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to da y operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating an d comparing our results across different periods 
our critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable allowances and deferred income taxes 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordanc e with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidenc e of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among othe r criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract fo r nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase orde r or a royalty report summarizing software licenses resold by an oem  distributo r or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed an d determinable as our standard payment terms generally range from to days depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of ou r customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses software togethe r with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee t o maintenance for its fair value 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful o f collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance fo r uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider historical return rates specific past due accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  custome r payment terms  historical collections  write offs and returns  changes i n customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and custome r credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent leve l of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our custome r relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in th e product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economi c conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenue s and our general and administrative expenses 
consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountin g standards no 
 we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred incom e taxes  and report such assets at the amount that is determined to b e more likely than not recoverable 
this evaluation considers several factors including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable incom e in future periods over which temporary differences reverse  the expecte d reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  an d available tax planning strategies 
as of december   based primarily upo n our cumulative losses  a valuation allowance has been recorded against ou r deferred tax assets 
in the event that evidence becomes available in the futur e to indicate that our deferred taxes will likely be recoverable eg  taxabl e income generated in and projected for future periods  our estimate of th e recoverability of deferred taxes may change  resulting in a reversal of all or a portion of such valuation allowance 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  ou r operating expenses increased from million in to million i n net income for the year ended december  was million compare d with a net loss of million for the year ended december  th e increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in i demand for our networ k storage solution software and ii sales from our oem partners 
revenu e contribution from our oem partners increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue for the year ended december  revenu e from resellers and distributors also increased in absolute dollars 
expense s increased in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue  softwar e development  and selling and marketing to support our growth 
for the year ende d december   we increased the number of employees and continued to inves t in infrastructure by purchasing additional computers and equipment 
we increase d the number of employees from employees as of december  to employees as of december  included in our results for the year ende d december  are a litigation settlement charge of million and lega l fees of million  each associated with litigation relating to paten t infringement that was resolved in the third quarter of revenues software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold throug h our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesse r extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  among othe r requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty repor t summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes ar e delivered to the customer 
we sometimes receive nonrefundable royalty advance s and engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
these arrangements ar e evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized when th e software product master is delivered and accepted  and the engineering services if any  have been performed 
software license revenue increased to million in from million in increased market acceptance and demand for our product an d increased sales from our oem partners were the primary drivers of the increas e in software license revenue 
software license revenue increased from both ou r oem partners and from our resellers 
revenue from our oem partners increased a s a percentage of total revenue 
we expect our software license revenue t o continue to grow and the percentage of future software license revenue derive d from our oem partners to increase 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenues are comprised o f software maintenance and technical support  professional services primaril y related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sale s of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technical suppor t contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenanc e term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the relate d services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily relate d to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenu e from engineering services is recognized in the period the services ar e completed 
in and  we had a limited number of transactions in which w e purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold th e bundled solution to our customer 
a portion of the contractual fee is recognize d as revenue when the hardware or software is delivered to the customer based o n the relative fair value of the delivered element s 
maintenance  softwar e services and other revenue increased to million in from million in the major factor behind the increase in maintenance  software services an d other revenue was the increase in the number of maintenance and technica l support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as we license mor e software  we expect these revenues will continue to increase 
the majority o f our new customers purchase maintenance and support and most customers rene w their maintenance and support after their initial contracts expire 
maintenanc e revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software services and othe r revenue increased from million in to million in th e increase in software services and other revenue was partially attributable t o our hardware sales which increased from million in to million i n this increase was the result of an increase in demand from our customer s for bundled solutions 
growth in our professional services sales  whic h increased from million in to million in  also contributed t o the increase in software services and other revenues 
this increase i n professional services revenue was related to the increase in our softwar e license customers who elected to purchase professional services 
we expec t maintenance  software services and other revenues to continue to increase 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software to remain successful in the network storage solutions market  we mus t continually upgrade our software by enhancing the existing features of ou r products and by adding new features and products 
we often evaluate whether t o develop these new offerings in house or whether we can achieve a greater retur n on investment by purchasing or licensing software from third parties 
based o n our evaluations  we have purchased or licensed various software for resale sinc e as of december  and  we had million and million respectively  of purchased software licenses that are being amortized over thre e years 
for the year ended december   we recorded million o f amortization related to these purchased software licenses 
for the year ende d december   we recorded million of amortization related to thes e purchased software licenses 
we will continue to evaluate third party softwar e licenses and may make additional purchases  which would result in an increase i n amortization expense 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues consist s primarily of personnel and other costs associated with providing softwar e implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  and training cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cos t of hardware purchased that was resold 
cost of maintenance  software service s and other revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  th e increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue wa s principally due to an increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sale s of maintenance and support contracts and professional services  we hire d additional employees to provide technical support and to implement our software additionally  due to an increase in hardware sales  our associated hardwar e costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our cost of maintenance  softwar e services and other revenue will continue to grow in absolute dollars as ou r revenue increases 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the year ende d december  the increase in gross profit and gross margin was directl y related to the increase in revenues 
additionally  the increased percentage o f revenue from our oem partners in contributed to the increase in gros s margins since revenues from our oem partners typically have higher gros s margins 
software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs fo r product development personnel and other related costs associated with th e development of new products  enhancements to existing products  qualit y assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to millio n in from million in the increase in software development cost s was primarily due to an increase in employees required to enhance and test ou r core network storage software product  as well as to develop new innovativ e features and options 
in addition  we required additional employees to test an d integrate our software with our oem partners products 
we intend to continu e recruiting and hiring product development personnel to support our developmen t process 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketin g personnel and related costs  travel  public relations expense  marketin g literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and the cost s associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expense s increased to million in from million in as a resul t of the increase in revenue and interest in our software  our commission expens e and travel expenses increased 
in addition  we continued to hire new sales an d sales support personnel and to expand our worldwide presence to accommodate ou r revenue growth 
we believe that to continue to grow sales  our sales an d marketing expenses will continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel cost s of general and administrative functions  public company related costs  director s and officers insurance  legal and professional fees and other general corporat e overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the overall decrease in general an d administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses 
fo r the year ended december  we had million in legal expense s attributable to litigation related to alleged patent infringement 
litigation settlement charge during the third quarter of  we resolved claims relating to allege d patent infringement brought by dot hill and by crossroads against us in th e united states district court for the western district of texas 
pursuant to th e terms of the settlement agreement between crossroads and us  we  withou t admission of infringement  made a one time payment of million and grante d to crossroads licenses to certain of our technology in exchange for a worldwide perpetual license to the technology underlying the crossroads patents at issu e in the litigation 
all claims against us by both dot hill and crossroads hav e now been dismissed 
interest and other income we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities i n government securities and other low risk investments 
interest and other incom e remained consistent at million 
interest income increased from millio n to million due to a higher average cash balance and slightly highe r interest rates 
additionally  interest and other income for the year ende d december   includes an out of period charge of approximately million to recognize investment losses realized in prior years 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax result s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was uncertain that the related deferred tax asset s would be realized based on our cumulative losses incurred since inception an d our limited period of profitability 
accordingly  we provided a full valuatio n allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our income tax provision consist s of tax expenses related to alternative minimum taxes and taxes from our foreig n subsidiaries 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues software license revenue software license revenue increased to million in from million in increased market acceptance and demand for our product  th e introduction of our new products and the successful launch by one of our oems o f a solution powered by our product were the primary drivers of the increase i n software license revenue 
software license revenue increased from both our oe m partners and from our resellers 
revenue from our oem partners increased as a percentage of total revenue 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenue increased to million in from million in the major factor contributing to th e increase in maintenance  software services and other revenue was the increase i n the number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as we are i n business longer  and as we license more software  we expect these revenues wil l continue to increase 
the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance an d support and most customers renew their maintenance and support after thei r initial contracts expire 
maintenance revenue increased from million fo r the year ended december  to million for the year ended december software services and other revenue increased to million from million in growth in our professional services revenue  which increase d from million in to million in  partially contributed to th e increase in software services and other revenues 
this increase in professiona l services revenue was related to the increase in our software license customer s that elected to purchase professional services 
additionally  our hardware sale s increased from million in to million in this increase wa s the result of an increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software as of december  and  we had million of purchase d software licenses that are being amortized over three years

amortization of capitalized software wa s  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues for the yea r ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost o f maintenance  software services and other revenue was principally due to a n increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sales of maintenance an d support contracts and professional services  we required a higher number o f employees to provide technical support and to implement our software 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the year ende d december  the increase in gross profit and gross margin was directl y related to the increase in revenues relative to the increase in expenses 
as ou r software license revenues increase  the associated costs as a percentage o f those revenues tend to decrease 
additionally  the increased percentage o f revenue from our oem partners in contributed to the increase in gros s margin since revenues from our oem partners have higher gross margins 
software development costs software development costs increased to million in from million in the increase in software development costs was primarily due t o an increase in employees required to enhance and test our network storag e software products  as well as to develop new innovative features and options

at the end of  we also opened a development office in china t o assist in our development work 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fro m million in as a result of the increase in revenue and interest i n our software  our commission expense and travel expenses increased 
in addition we continued to hire new sales and sales support personnel and to expand ou r worldwide presence to accommodate our revenue growth 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expense s was partially due to a million increase in legal expense attributable t o litigation relating to alleged patent infringement with dot hill system s corporation dot hill and crossroads systems texas  inc crossroads expenses of million for the year ended december   related t o compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and an increase i n the number of employees also contributed to the increase in general an d administrative expenses 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased to million in from million in this decrease in interest income was due to lower interes t rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securitie s balances 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax loss incurre d from the period from inception february  through december   a s we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will no t be realized based on our early stage of operations 
accordingly  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our income ta x provision consists of tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries 
lease abandonment charge in november  we relocated our headquarters to a larger facility t o accommodate our future growth 
as a result of this relocation  we vacated ou r previous office space and recorded a charge for the estimated loss we expecte d to incur on the remaining lease obligation 
the charge of million include d the remaining lease rental obligation reduced by cash flows we expected t o generate from an agreement to sub lease the facility as well as the write off o f leasehold improvements at our previous facility 
liquidity and capital resources our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance a s of december  increased by million compared to december  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketable securitie s totaled million at december  as of december   we ha d million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketabl e securities 
in  we made investments in our infrastructure to support ou r long term growth 
we increased the total number of employees in and mad e investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
as we continue t o grow  we will continue to make investments in property and equipment and wil l need to continue to increase our headcount 
in the past  we have also used cas h to purchase software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue t o evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions and if the righ t opportunity presents itself we may continue to use our cash for these purposes however  as of the date of this filing  we have no agreements  commitments o r understandings with respect to any such acquisitions 
we currently do not have any debt and our only significant commitments ar e related to our office leases 
in connection with our acquisition of ip metrics in july  we wer e required to make cash payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics  whic h were contingent on the level of revenues from ip metrics products for a perio d of twenty four months through june  in  we made payments to th e former shareholders of ip metrics totaling  we believe we have n o further payment obligations 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up t o two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
since october   shares have been repurchased at an aggregate purchase price of millio n including  shares repurchased in at an aggregate purchase price o f million 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for th e year ended december   compared with net cash used in operatin g activities of million for the year ended december  and millio n for the year ended december  the positive trend in our cash provided b y operating activities is mainly due to the improvement in our net results whic h resulted in net income of million for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in addition to our ne t income for and our decrease in net loss for and  our deferre d revenues increased by million in compared to million in an d million in the increase in our deferred revenue is the result of a n increase in our maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized a s revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
this amount was partially offse t by increases in our net accounts receivable balances of million in million in and million in the increases in our account s receivable balances are due to our revenue growth 
we expect cash provided b y operating activities to continue to increase as we anticipate our net incom e will increase 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared t o net cash provided by investing activities of million in and million in included in investing activities for each year are the sale s and purchases of our marketable securities 
these represent the sales maturities and reinvesting of our marketable securities 
the net cash provide d by investing activities from the net sale of securities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amount s will fluctuate from year to year depending on the maturity dates of ou r marketable securities 
the cash used to purchase property and equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
th e cash used to purchase software licenses was million in and an d million in we continually evaluate potential software licenses and w e may continue to make similar investments if we find opportunities that woul d benefit our business 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  million in and million in we received proceeds from the exercis e of stock options of million in  million in and millio n in we made payments of million in and million in t o acquire treasury stock 
the company s only significant commitments relate to its operating leases the company has an operating lease covering its primary office facility tha t expires in february  the company also has several operating leases relate d to offices in foreign countries 
the expiration dates for these leases rang e from through the following is a schedule of future minimum leas e payments for all operating leases as of december  year ending december thereafter  we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents an d marketable securities  and expected cash flows from operations will b e sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months

among other things  sab provides guidance on share based paymen t valuations  income statement classification and presentation  capitalization o f costs and related income tax accounting 
sfas r provides for adoption using either the modified prospective o r modified retrospective transition method 
we will adopt sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method in which compensatio n cost is recognized beginning january  for all share based payment s granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior t o january  that remain unvested on that date 
we expect to continue to us e the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value o f stock option awards 
adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an effect on ou r results of operations 
the future impact of sfas r cannot be predicted a t this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted however  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the effect would hav e approximated the sfas pro forma amounts disclosed in footnote j to ou r accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess o f recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rathe r than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we have historically no t realized significant tax benefits associated with tax deductions for stock base d compensation 
further  those amounts cannot be estimated for future period s because they depend on  among other things  when employees will exercise th e stock options and the market price of the corporation s common stock at the tim e of exercise

 reporting accounting changes in interim financia l statements 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it i s impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulativ e effects of the change 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes i n accounting principle be recognized by including in net income in the period o f the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle this standard generally will not apply with respect to the adoption of ne w accounting standards  as new accounting standards usually include specifi c transition provisions  and will not override transition provisions contained i n new or existing accounting literature 
sfas is effective for fiscal year s beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted fo r accounting changes and error corrections made in years beginning after the dat e that sfas was issued 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfa s on january  will have a significant effect on its financial s condition or results of operations
