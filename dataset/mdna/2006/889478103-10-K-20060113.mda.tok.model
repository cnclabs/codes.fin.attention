item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was another record year for us 
home sales revenues increased by over fiscal and net income increased by 
in addition  new sales contracts signed in fiscal increased over fiscal and our backlog of homes under contract but not yet delivered to home buyers backlog at october  was greater than the backlog at october beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a slowdown in new contracts signed 
we believe this slowdown is attributable to a softening of demand from our home buyers  a lack of available home sites caused by delays in new community openings  delays in approvals of new phases of existing communities and our reluctance to sign new contracts that would require us to extend delivery dates beyond the twelve months that we are quoting to home buyers in many communities 
in addition  we believe the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the united states in fiscal  high gasoline prices and anticipated increases in heating fuel costs during the winter months of fiscal have caused consumer confidence to decline  thereby decreasing demand for our homes 
because home price increases have slowed in most markets  it appears that customers are taking more time in making home buying decisions 
despite this slowdown  we remain cautiously optimistic about the future growth of our business 
our industry demographics remain strong due to the continuing regulation induced constraints on lot supplies and the growing number of affluent households 
based upon our evaluation of our backlog  our current communities open and the expected timing of new community openings in fiscal  we believe that we will deliver between  homes and  homes in fiscal with an average delivered price between  and  in addition  we expect to recognize between million and million of revenues on the percentage of completion accounting method related to four high rise residences that are under construction 
we expect that net income for fiscal will be between million and million  and that diluted earnings per share will be between and per share 
geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  a versatile and abundant home mortgage market and improving demographics are promoting demand for those builders who can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that this evolution in our industry favors the large publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we currently own or control more than  home sites in markets we consider to be affluent  a substantial number of which sites already have the approvals necessary for development 
we believe that as the approval process becomes more difficult  and as the political pressure from no growth proponents increases  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions should allow us to continue to grow for a number of years to come 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options whenever possible  thus allowing us to obtain the necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial downpayment from a buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
in the ordinary course of doing business  we must make estimates and judgments that affect decisions on how we operate and on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to the recognition of income and expenses  impairment of assets  estimates of future improvement and amenity costs  capitalization of costs to inventory  provisions for litigation  insurance and warranty costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and adjust our estimates based on the information currently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions or conditions 

back to contents our revenues have grown on average over per year in the last decade 
we have funded this growth through the reinvestment of profits  bank borrowings and capital market transactions 
at october   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million available under our billion bank revolving credit facility  which extends to july  in june  we issued million of senior notes due we used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due and the remainder of the proceeds  together with available cash  to repay our million bank term loan which bore interest at and was due in july with these resources  our strong cash flow from operations and our history of success in accessing the public debt markets  we believe we have the resources available to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventories during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development  it generally takes four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to years or more to complete 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  we evaluate the property in accordance with the guidelines of sfas if this evaluation indicates that an impairment loss should be recognized  we charge cost of sales for the estimated impairment loss in the period determined 
in addition  we review all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land that is under a purchase contract but not owned  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine which costs that have been capitalized to the property are recoverable and which costs should be written off 
we recognized million of write offs of costs related to current and future communities in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we have a significant number of land purchase contracts  sometimes referred to herein as options or option agreements  which we evaluate in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  as amended by fin r 
pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of a variable interest entity vie is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the operations of the vie 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for land purchase contracts with sellers meeting the definition of a vie  we perform a review to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this review requires substantive judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various 
back to contents estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of the land under contract 
because  in most cases  we do not have any ownership interests in the entities with which we contract to purchase land  we generally do not have the ability to compel these entities to provide assistance in our review 
in many instances  these entities provide us little  if any  financial information 
revenue and cost recognition traditional home sales because the construction time for one of our traditional homes is generally less than one year  revenues and cost of revenues from traditional home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
high rise mid rise projects we are developing several high rise mid rise projects that will take substantially more than one year to complete 
if these projects qualify  revenue will be recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  revenues and costs are to be recognized when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non delivery of the unit  sufficient units in the project have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales proceeds are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the project can be reasonably estimated 
revenues and costs of individual projects will be recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which the home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale  less an allowance for cancellations  and will be based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
total estimated revenues and construction costs will be reviewed periodically and any change will be applied prospectively 
we expect to begin recognizing revenue and costs using percentage of completion accounting on several projects in fiscal land sales land sales revenues and cost of revenues are recorded at the time that title and possession of the property have been transferred to the buyer 
the company recognizes the pro rata share of revenues and cost of revenues of land sales to entities in which the company has a or less interest based upon the ownership percentage attributable to the non company investors 
any profit not recognized in a transaction reduces the company s investment in the entity 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to several joint ventures  to toll brothers realty trust group trust and to toll brothers realty trust group ii trust ii 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities of million  were committed to invest or advance an additional million in the aggregate to these entities if needed and had guaranteed approximately million of these entities indebtedness and or loan commitments 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities and related party transactions  for more 
back to contents information regarding these entities 
we do not believe that these arrangements  individually or in the aggregate  have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method 
results of operations the following table compares certain income statement items related to our operations amounts in millions year ended october  revenues home sales land sales total revenues cost of revenues home sales land sales interest expense selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other equity earnings from unconsolidated entities interest and other expenses related to early retirement of debt income before income taxes income taxes net income note percentages for interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses and income from operations are based on total revenues

fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues in fiscal of billion  homes were higher than the billion  homes reported in fiscal by approximately billion  or 
the increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of the homes delivered 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october   which was primarily the result of a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and the increase in the number of new contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal  homes as compared to the first six months of fiscal  homes 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal was the result of increased selling prices in our communities and a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas 
the value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal was billion  homes  a increase over the billion  homes value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal the increase in fiscal 
back to contents was attributable to a increase in the number of new contracts signed and a increase in the average value of each contract  due primarily to the location and size of homes sold and increases in base selling prices 
the increase in the number of new contracts signed was attributable to the continued demand for our homes and an increase in the number of communities from which we were selling homes 
at october   we were selling from communities compared to communities at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities at october  the value of new contracts signed in the quarter ended october  increased over the comparable period of fiscal the increase in the quarter was attributable to a increase in the average value of each contract signed and a increase in the number of new contracts signed 
see the overview contained in this section for a discussion relating to the slowdown in fourth quarter contract signings 
we believe that demand for our homes is attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites  attractive mortgage rates and the belief of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide in markets we consider to be affluent 
at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  higher than the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog at october  compared to the backlog at october  was primarily attributable to a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  a increase in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the backlog of homes acquired in the acquisition of the orlando division of landstar homes  offset  in part  by a increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal compared to fiscal  and a increase in the price of the homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal of the  homes in backlog at october   we expect to deliver approximately of them in fiscal based on the size and the expected delivery dates of our current backlog  the additional communities that we expect to open in the early part of fiscal and the expected continuing demand for our homes  we believe that we will deliver between  and  of our traditional homes in fiscal and that the average delivered price of those homes will be between  and  home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased by basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than costs and from efficiencies realized from the increased number of homes delivered 
for fiscal  we expect that home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues will be between and of revenues from the delivery of our traditional homes 
the expected increase is based on anticipated material and labor cost increases  which we believe will outpace home price increases  and the expected cost of additional sales incentives we have started to offer home buyers in certain markets 
in addition  we will begin recognizing revenues and costs from several of our high rise mid rise products in fiscal based on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
for fiscal  we expect to recognize between million and million of revenues under the percentage of completion method  and we believe costs will be approximately of these revenues 
land sales we are developing several communities in which we expect to sell a portion of the land to other builders or entities 
the amount of land sales and the profitability of such sales will vary from year to year depending upon the sale and delivery of the specific land parcels 
land sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of land sales was approximately of land sales revenues in fiscal  as compared to approximately in fiscal for fiscal  land sales are expected to be approximately million  and cost of land sales are expected to be approximately million 

back to contents interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific home site by home site basis for our home building operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending upon many factors  including the period of time that we have owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was of total revenues in fiscal  slightly lower than the of total revenues in fiscal for fiscal  we expect interest expense to be approximately of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to the costs incurred to support the increased levels of construction and sales activity in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the continued costs incurred in the search for new land to replace the home sites that were sold during the period and to expand our land position to enable us to grow in the future 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  we expect that sg a as a percentage of total revenues will be between and 
income from operations based upon the above  income from operations increased million in fiscal over fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal equity earnings from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities and related party transactions  for more information regarding our investments in and commitments to these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  we expect to recognize approximately million of earnings from our investments in these joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
interest and other in fiscal  interest and other was million  an increase of million from the million recognized in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher interest income and higher income recognized from our ancillary businesses 
for fiscal  we expect interest and other income to be approximately million 
expenses related to early retirement of debt we recognized a pre tax charge of million in fiscal  representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes  and the bank loan termination charge related to the repayment of our million bank term loan in june we recognized a pre tax charge of million in fiscal  representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  
back to contents the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes  and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our million bank revolving credit agreement that was replaced by a billion bank revolving credit agreement that expires in july income before income taxes income before income taxes increased million in fiscal over fiscal income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective rate of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the difference in the rate in fiscal compared to the rate in fiscal was due primarily to a change in our estimated combined federal and state income tax rate before providing for the effect of permanent book tax differences base rate for fiscal and the impact of recalculating our net deferred tax liability using the new base rate 
the change in the base rate was due to the combination of changes in tax legislation and regulations and an expected shift in income to states with higher tax rates in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional information regarding the change in the income tax rates and the impact on the financial statements 
for fiscal  we expect that the effective tax rate will be approximately 
fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal of billion  homes were higher than those of fiscal by approximately billion  or 
the increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of homes delivered 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october   which was primarily the result of a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and a increase in the number of new contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal as compared to the first six months of fiscal the increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices and a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas  offset  in part  by a change in the mix of product types delivered 
the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to a increase in the number of new sales contracts signed and a increase in the average selling price of the homes 
the increase in the number of new sales contracts signed in fiscal was attributable to the continued demand for our homes and the increase in the number of communities from which we were selling homes 
we were selling from communities at october   compared to communities at october  we believe that the demand for our homes was attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites in our markets  attractive mortgage rates and the belief of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide  compared to approximately  home sites at october  the increase in the average price of homes contracted for in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices and a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas 
at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  an increase of over the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog at october   compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to the increase in the number and average price of new contracts signed during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by an increase in the number and average price of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
back to contents home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased basis points in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than construction costs 
inventory write offs of million in fiscal were higher than the million of write offs in fiscal as a percentage of home sales revenues  write offs in fiscal were comparable to those of fiscal land sales we are developing several communities in which we sell a portion of the land to other builders or entities 
the amount of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal land sales revenues in fiscal included million from the sale of land to the trust 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  related party transactions  for a description of the sale to the trust 
land costs as a percentage of land sales revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher cost parcels being sold in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific home site by home site basis for our home building operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending upon many factors  including the period of time that we have owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of total revenues was slightly lower in fiscal than in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal  sg a spending increased by  or million  as compared to fiscal  while total revenues in fiscal increased by as compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to higher sales commissions  higher costs incurred to operate the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and increased compensation and benefit costs 
income from operations based upon the above  income from operations increased million  or in fiscal over fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal equity earnings from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings on sales to unrelated parties from these entities 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities and related party transactions  for more information regarding our investments in and commitments to these entities 
earnings from these entities vary significantly from year to year due to the variability of the levels of operations of these entities 
in fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from these unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal interest and other interest and other income for fiscal was million  a decrease of 
million from the million of interest and other income in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a million profit recognized from the sale of a small commercial property in fiscal and a decrease in forfeited 
back to contents customer deposits in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by higher income recognized from our ancillary businesses  higher management and construction fee income  and higher interest income 
expenses related to the early retirement of debt we recognized a pre tax charge of million in fiscal representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes  and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our million bank revolving credit agreement that was replaced by a new billion bank revolving credit agreement that expires in july we recognized a pre tax charge of million in fiscal representing the premiums paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  and our senior subordinated notes due  and the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes 
income before income taxes income before income taxes increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective rate of in fiscal and in fiscal capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
we have used our cash flow from operating activities  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our increased backlog and the increasing number of communities in which we are offering homes for sale  invest in unconsolidated entities  repurchase our stock  and repay debt 
cash flow from operating activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases are primarily the result of our strong revenue growth in fiscal and fiscal we expect that our inventory will continue to increase and we are currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately billion including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures which we have invested in  made advances to or made loan guarantees on behalf of  of which we had paid or deposited approximately million 
in general  cash flow from operating activities assumes that as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace the ones delivered 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our traditional single family homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer 
we generally will not start construction of a high rise mid rise project until a significant number of units are sold 
because of the significant amount of time between when a home buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and when the construction of the home is completed and delivered to the home buyer  we believe we can estimate  with reasonable accuracy  the number of homes we will deliver in the next to months 
should our business decline significantly  our inventory would decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  resulting in a temporary increase in our cash flow from operations 
in addition  under such circumstances  we might delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
during the past three fiscal years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites 
back to contents or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the section cash flow from investing activities 
we have a billion unsecured credit facility with banks  which extends through july  at october   interest was payable on borrowings under the facility at subject to adjustment based upon our debt ratings and leverage ratio above the eurodollar rate or other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
we have also elected to periodically maintain a loan balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility  such borrowing is purely elective by us and is not required by the terms of our revolving credit facility 
at october   we had no borrowings outstanding against the facility  and had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under it 
to reduce borrowing costs  extend the maturities of our long term debt and raise additional funds for general corporate purposes  during the last three fiscal years we issued four series of senior notes aggregating billion  and used the proceeds to redeem million of senior subordinated notes and  together with other available cash  to repay a million bank term loan 
in addition  we raised approximately million from the issuance of six million shares of our common stock in a public offering in august these financing activities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the section cash flow from financing activities 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our expected growth and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources  cash flow from operating activities  our existing sources of credit and the public debt markets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior and senior subordinated notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior and senior subordinated notes  million of loans payable and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
c amounts represent our obligations under our k  deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million has been recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  
back to contents increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect our profits 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home  and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates  and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a b fiscal year of expected maturity amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a we have a billion revolving credit facility with banks  which extends through july  at october   interest was payable on borrowings under this facility at this rate will vary based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no borrowings and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
b our mortgage subsidiary has a million line of credit with four banks to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the banks and bears interest at the banks overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october   the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under this line are included in the fiscal maturities 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
