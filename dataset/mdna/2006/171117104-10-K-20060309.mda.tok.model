item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview over the past five years the company has experienced declining sales due to a combination of heightened global competition and the company s strategic response to the changing market place 
while sales of less competitive and less profitable lines have declined  the company has lowered its costs and utilized excess cash flow from operations to reduce bank indebtedness and to repurchase its outstanding common stock 
the company has also concentrated its efforts on more attractive niches and the rate of sales decline has slowed in more recent years 
beginning in the late s  the us furniture industry began undergoing a dramatic shift from a domestic manufacturing base to a highly competitive global supply chain 
this shift accelerated over the course of the last five years 
global manufacturers  primarily in china and other asian countries  have used substantially lower labor costs and somewhat lower material cost to achieve a competitive advantage over us based manufacturers in several furniture categories 
as a result  numerous us based manufacturing operations have ceased to exist or have converted to alternative business models 
meanwhile  consumers have benefited from products of reasonable quality at substantially lower prices 
this has altered the fundamental value perception of consumers and the underlying value propositions of businesses serving the industry 
in the face of this fundamental industry dynamic  the company has leveraged its manufacturing competency and know how to achieve lower costs and shifted its products toward more attractive niche focused businesses 
in its efforts to achieve lower costs  the company has increased imports of low cost  labor intensive furniture components and finished furniture from overseas 
in addition  the company has initiated efforts to develop built to order products to improve its overall value proposition 
management believes that this hybrid approach of domestic manufacturing and assembly operations combined with global sourcing allows the company to better control product quality  service speed and quality  as well as product selection to meet consumer lifestyle needs 
as a result of these strategic decisions  sales of less competitive and or less profitable products have declined  costs have been reduced and excess cash from operations has been generated 
to date  the excess cash flow has been utilized to reduce bank indebtedness and to repurchase outstanding common shares of the company 
management believes overall competitiveness and future growth opportunities are based on a few key capabilities first  understanding consumer lifestyles needs  second  meeting those needs with product selection and built to order customization  third  supplying reliable and durable product quality  fourth  serving its retail and commercial customers with reliability and speed of delivery  and fifth  implementing effective sales and marketing programs 
the company s market position is influenced by its ability to execute these key elements  as well as global transportation  distribution logistics and manufacturing cost structures 
management closely monitors the activities and performance of the company s different brands  as well as its multiple manufacturing and distribution operations 
as the company continues to adapt to heightened global competition  it will seek increased cooperation and productivity from the various operating units 
adaptation to the market and integration of some common activities could result in restructuring charges  asset impairment  and or increased operating expenses in the future 
in addition  the company has experienced inflationary price increases in raw materials  labor and other costs 
management is seeking ways to mitigate the impact of these factors through product engineering  manufacturing productivity  global sourcing and greater internal integration of activities 
however  due to the competitive environment the company may not be able to pass through any significant price increases to its customers
