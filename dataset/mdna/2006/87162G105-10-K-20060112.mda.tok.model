item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading risk factors 
overview synovis life technologies  inc synovis or the company is a diversified medical device company engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the surgical and interventional treatment of disease 
our business is conducted in two reportable segments  the surgical business and interventional business  with segmentation based upon the similarities of the underlying business operations  products and markets of each 
our surgical business develops  manufactures and markets implantable biomaterial products  devices for microsurgery and surgical tools  all designed to reduce risk and or facilitate critical surgeries  leading to better patient outcomes and or lower costs 
our interventional business develops  engineers  prototypes and manufactures coils  helices  stylets  guidewires and other complex micro wire  polymer and micro machined metal components used in interventional devices for cardiac rhythm management  neurostimulation  vascular and other procedures 
in addition  our interventional business designs and develops proprietary technology platforms which can be adapted for our customers 
operations that are not included in either of the operating segments are reported in the category corporate and other 
the corporate and other segment captures costs that are not directly assignable to one of the operating business segments  including the costs of operating a public company and the estimated time of management personnel in support of corporate activities 
the following is a brief summary of our fiscal results net revenue increased to million 
interventional business revenue increased to million 
surgical business revenue decreased to million 
consolidated operating income was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal surgical business operating income decreased to million 
interventional business operating income increased million to million from a loss of million in fiscal corporate and other costs increased to million 
net income totaled million or seven cents per diluted share  down from cents per diluted share in fiscal the following tables summarize the company s condensed consolidated operating results for the years ended october   and summary of operating results in thousands net revenue    cost of revenue    gross margin    selling  general and administrative    research and development    other operating expenses    operating income   operating results in thousands except per share data net revenue increased during fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income decreased to in fiscal from  in the prior year 
net income for fiscal decreased to  or cents per diluted share  from  or cents per diluted share  during fiscal our interventional business predominantly serves the cardiac rhythm management crm market and we address three areas of this market pacing  implantable cardioverter defibrillation icd and congestive heart failure chf 
within the crm market  we produce conductor and shocking coils for pacing and defibrillator leads  helices for active fixation leads  and stylets used to implant all types of leads 
our interventional business has customarily experienced variations in revenue from period to period primarily due to historical variability in the timing of customer demand 
such variations may continue in the future 
the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by market for the years ended october interventional business net revenue cardiac rhythm management   other   total   the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by product for the years ended october interventional business net revenue coils and helices   stylets and other wireforms   machining  molding and tool making   other   total   interventional business net revenue increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue increase is primarily due to increased sales of precious metal coils to customers 
our interventional businesses three largest customers collectively accounted for and of revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
our interventional business is indirectly affected by the market conditions and trends of the crm market  and we are directly affected by the actions of our customers in response to this market 
sales of components within the crm market increased  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal our surgical business generated net revenue of  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal the following table summarizes our surgical business net revenue by product group for fiscal and fiscal surgical business net revenue peri strips   other biomaterial products   devices for microsurgery   surgical tools and other   total   the decreased volume in surgical business net revenue is due to decreased unit sales of peri strips 
worldwide net revenue from the sales of peri strips  which includes revenue from our recently introduced peri strips dry with veritas collagen matrix psd veritas  was  in fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal revenue of  psd veritas incorporates our veritas remodelable tissue platform  which becomes the histological equivalent to the host tissue over time 
peri strips are used to reduce risks and improve patient outcomes in several procedures  with the predominant procedure being gastric bypass surgery 
the decrease in peri strips revenue in fiscal is believed to be in part attributable to several factors occurring within the gastric bypass market  which include but may not be limited to limited availability of insurance covering gastric bypass  certain hospitals electing not to support gastric bypass programs  competing buttressing products  alternatives to gastric bypass surgery  including gastric banding  and patient perception of gastric bypass as a safe  effective treatment option 
in addition to the factors influencing the gastric bypass market  we believe that sales force effectiveness has also impacted peri strips revenue 
in september  we announced that our surgical business will transition to a direct sales force in the us market for all products except devices for microsurgery 
we believe a direct sales force is our best avenue for the revenue potential for both our current and future market opportunities 
the transition will be implemented in phases and is expected to be completed in early fiscal we are focusing on managing the sales transition for our customers  as well as the hiring our direct sales force 
as of december  we have hired over half of the expected direct sales representatives 
to the extent the above and other market factors continue to negatively impact peri strips revenue  surgical business and consolidated operating performance could be adversely affected 
also  while we are implementing our direct sales strategy  we do not expect to see immediate revenue gains from any direct resources added in the near term given the time required to identify  hire and train quality sales representatives 
revenue from devices for microsurgery increased  or to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal driving this increase were increased sales of our coupler products  which grew by or to  in fiscal  as well as in revenue from our neurotube product  which was acquired in december the coupler is a device used to connect extremely small veins or arteries  without sutures  quickly  easily and with consistently excellent results 
the neurotube is designed to assist in the regeneration of nerves 
a limited release of two new sizes of the coupler  mm and mm  occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with a full market release expected in the first quarter of fiscal revenue from surgical tools and other products increased to  in fiscal  driven by sales of our biograft  which increased to  in the year 
in the third quarter of fiscal  new regulatory regulations came into effect that made the manufacture of the biograft cost prohibitive 
after considering other alternatives  we chose to discount biograft pricing and sold the majority of our biograft finished goods inventory through our existing sales channels 
we wrote off the remaining in biograft finished goods and raw materials inventory during the year 
as noted above  our surgical business is transitioning to a direct sales force for certain products sold in the united states 
we have historically sold such products through a network of stocking distributors and independent sales representatives 
stocking distributors purchased product from us at a discount to hospital list prices  and commissions paid to independent sales representatives were netted with the associated revenue 
based on unit volumes sold of these products in fiscal  the amount of discounts from hospital list prices granted to distributors and commissions paid to independent sales representatives totaled approximately  our consolidated gross margin decreased five percentage points to in fiscal from during fiscal the decreased consolidated gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to a lower gross margin within our surgical business and the impact of business unit mix weighted more heavily to our interventional business  which operates at a lower gross margin percentage than our surgical business 
gross margin in the interventional business increased two percentage points in fiscal  from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement is due to improved manufacturing efficiencies  primarily higher labor efficiencies  and our continued transfer of manufacturing to puerto rico  where labor rates are lower 
in our surgical business  the gross margin for fiscal decreased seven percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a number of factors product mix shifts in fiscal lowered the gross margin 
this is primarily due to lower sales of peri strips  which on average have a higher margin compared to other surgical products 
lower production throughput in fiscal decreased the gross margin  primarily due to lower utilization of manufacturing resources and higher fixed production costs  which thereby resulted in higher overhead rates 
inventory obsolescence primarily due to product discontinuations  including biograft  impacted the gross margin by in addition  our surgical business gross margin will be affected by the increase in sales price of certain of our products as we transition to a direct sales force 
factors which affect the consolidated gross margin include the relative revenue of each business segment  product mix within each business segment  volume  product acquisitions and disposals  and other production activities 
accordingly  our consolidated gross margins may fluctuate from period to period based on variations in these factors 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense during fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  sg a expense remained consistent at in both fiscal and fiscal during the period  we incurred additional sg a costs related to the commencement of our colorectal clinical market evaluation using psd veritas  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  increases in sales and marketing costs within our interventional business  increases at our surgical business resulting from our fiscal facility expansion  as well as increased amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of the neurotube product line 
in fiscal  we expect to incur significantly greater sg a expense within our surgical business compared to fiscal due to two key activities 
first  the transition to a direct sales force in our domestic markets is expected to result in approximately  in incremental expense in fiscal second  the colorectal clinical market evaluation is expected to add approximately  in incremental expense in fiscal research and development r d expense during fiscal was  a decrease of  from  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  r d expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease is driven by a decrease in interventional business r d spending to  in fiscal as certain development resources were redirected towards customer specific development projects 
r d spending within our surgical business increased to  due primarily to two studies within our surgical business a colorectal circular stapler study and a bariatric circular stapler study  both utilizing psd veritas 
in both business units  r d expense can fluctuate from year to year based on the timing and progress through external parties of the projects 
the timing of r d expense will continue to be influenced primarily by the number of projects and related r d personnel requirements  development and regulatory approval processes  and expected timing and nature of costs for each project 
during fiscal we incurred of other operating expenses  as compared to in fiscal the reason for the decrease is in costs incurred in fiscal related to our consideration of a significant acquisition  which was terminated for a variety of reasons 
costs related to legal and other fees incurred in connection with certain lawsuits filed against the company increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal these lawsuits alleged that the company and certain of its executive officers violated the securities exchange act of by issuing false or misleading statements about the company s business and prospects  which artificially inflated the price of the company s securities 
on august   the united states district court for the district of minnesota granted plaintiffs motion to amend the consolidated complaint and granted the company s motion to dismiss these consolidated lawsuits  with prejudice  after finding that the amended consolidated complaint failed to plead plaintiffs claims with sufficient particularity  as required under the private securities litigation reform act of two related actions brought by individual shareholders who seek to represent the company derivatively have also been filed in united states district court for the district of minnesota 
those lawsuits allege that certain officers and the company s directors violated their fiduciary duties to the company 
on november   these related actions were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs 
operating income for fiscal was  compared to  during fiscal interest income increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal  primarily the results of higher interest rates in fiscal and maintaining a higher investment account balance throughout the year 
the provision for income taxes was in fiscal  at an effective tax rate of  as compared to  at an effective tax rate of in fiscal the lower effective rate is due to the level of tax exempt interest income and r d credits relative to pre tax income 
as of october   we have recorded in net current deferred income tax assets and in net long term deferred income tax liabilities 
operating results in thousands except per share data net revenue decreased during fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net income for fiscal decreased to  or cents per diluted share  from  or cents per diluted share  during fiscal interventional business net revenue decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our interventional business has customarily experienced variations in revenue from period to period primarily due to inherent variability in the timing of customer demand 
the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by market for the years ended october interventional business net revenue cardiac rhythm management   other   total   the following table summarizes our interventional business net revenue by product for the years ended october interventional business net revenue coils and helices   stylets and other wireforms   machining  molding and tool making   other   total   revenue from the three largest customers of the interventional business was a combined  in fiscal  a decrease of  or from  in fiscal our interventional business is affected by the general dynamics of the crm market  and we are most affected by the actions of our customers in response to this market 
we  like other companies serving the crm device industry  were severely impacted in fiscal as customers reduced purchases 
surgical business net revenue increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the following table summarizes our surgical business net revenue by product for the years ended october surgical business net revenue peri strips   other biomaterial products   devices for microsurgery   surgical tools and other   total   driving the growth in fiscal was our other biomaterial product line 
this line  which includes tissue guard and veritas  accounted for of this segments growth 
veritas and tissue guard patches used in vascular procedures were responsible for most of this growth 
our devices for microsurgery product line increased or  due primarily to increased sales of the coupler 
the coupler is a device used to connect extremely small veins or arteries  without sutures  quickly  easily and with consistently excellent results 
we consider our surgical tools and other product line to be mature 
peri strips revenue increased or to  in fiscal over fiscal peri strips are used to reduce risks and improve patient outcomes in surgical procedures  notably gastric bypass surgery and certain thoracic procedures 
our consolidated gross margin decreased three percentage points to in fiscal from during fiscal gross margins in our interventional business decreased eight percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to lower production volumes and reduced labor hours  which resulted in significantly higher overhead rates 
in our surgical business  the gross margin for fiscal decreased two percentage points to  primarily due to lower utilization of manufacturing resources and higher fixed production costs  which thereby resulted in higher overhead rates associated with fiscal manufacturing activities 
sg a expense during fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  sg a expense increased five percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal planned increases in regulatory and clinical expenses  facility expansion costs and marketing efforts  combined with lower revenue levels  are the primary reasons for this percentage increase 
r d expense during fiscal was  an increase of  from  in as a percentage of net revenue  r d expense increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is partially due to the increased number  timing and nature of various surgical r d projects  as well as development expenses of various interventional projects including proprietary technology platforms which can be adapted for our customers 
during the second half of fiscal we incurred of other operating expenses  which were recorded within our surgical business 
we incurred of expenses related to our consideration of a significant acquisition  which was terminated for a variety of reasons 
the remaining was for legal fees incurred through october  pertaining to the lawsuits filed against the company in fiscal operating income for fiscal was  a decrease from  during fiscal interest income increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal  as a result of increased cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to  in net proceeds from our september private placement 
the provision for income taxes was in fiscal  at an effective tax rate of  as compared to  at an effective tax rate of in fiscal as of october   we have recorded  in net current deferred income tax assets and  in net long term deferred income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and operating leases 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our commitments under these obligations are as follows for the year ended october thereafter total operating leases    cash and cash equivalents were  at october  as compared to  at october   a decrease of  the decrease in cash is primarily related to our net purchases of  of short term investments during fiscal these investments represent highly liquid  low risk debt securities with maturities greater than three months 
additional cash was used primarily for investments in capital equipment and facilities necessary to support our expected future growth 
operating activities provided cash of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal cash was provided by operations during fiscal through the combination of net income of  non cash expenses of  and a decrease in working capital of depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment increased in fiscal due primarily to equipment acquisitions at our interventional business and full year depreciation of various investments made in fiscal  most notably the facility expansion of our surgical business 
inventory decreased  due primarily to decreased inventory at our interventional business where inventories can fluctuate significantly depending upon the timing of purchases and usage of precious metals 
our consolidated days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at october  was at days  down from days in fiscal  due to a significant receivable paid in early fiscal by a customer of our interventional business 
investing activities used cash of  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  the decrease is primarily due to the net purchases of  in short term investments in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  when the majority of our cash investments were initiated 
in addition  of cash was used for the purchase of substantially all of the operating assets of neuroregen  llc 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal  a decrease of  from fiscal  and largely reflect expenditures for replacement and new manufacturing equipment within our interventional business 
during fiscal  we currently expect to invest up to  in capital assets for various manufacturing and other projects 
financing activities provided  of cash during fiscal  compared to  in proceeds from our stock based compensation plans totaled  in fiscal  a decrease from  in fiscal  while payments of capital lease and other long term obligations decreased to in fiscal as of october   we have no capital lease or other long term obligations 
we have historically funded the operations and investments in our businesses utilizing internally generated cash flow and existing cash balances 
we believe existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  coupled with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements for the next months 
these forward looking statements  as well as our long term cash requirements  will be a function of a number of variables  including research and development priorities  acquisition opportunities and the growth and profitability of the business 
we may enter into derivative instruments or perform hedging activities 
however  our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales 
inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries may therefore influence the demand for our products by changing the price of our products as denominated in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
