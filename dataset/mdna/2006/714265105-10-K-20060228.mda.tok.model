item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
overview perot systems corporation  originally incorporated in the state of texas in and reincorporated in the state of delaware on december   is a worldwide provider of information technology commonly referred to as it services and business solutions to a broad range of customers 
we offer our customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business objectives  chosen from a breadth of services  including technology infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
with this approach  our customers benefit from integrated service offerings that help synchronize their strategy  systems  and infrastructure 
as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
our services our customers may contract with us for any one or more of the following categories of services infrastructure services applications services business process services consulting services infrastructure services infrastructure services are typically performed under multi year contracts in which we assume operational responsibility for various aspects of our customers businesses  including data center management  web hosting and internet access  desktop solutions  messaging services  program management  hardware maintenance and monitoring  network management  including vpn services  service desk capabilities  physical security  network security  and risk management 
we typically hire a significant portion of the customer s staff that have supported these functions 
we then apply our expertise and operating methodologies to increase the efficiency of the operations  which usually results in increased operational quality at a lower cost 
applications services applications services include services such as application development and maintenance  including the development and maintenance of custom and packaged application software for customers  and application systems migration and testing  which includes the migration of applications from legacy environments to current technologies  as well as performing quality assurance functions on custom applications 
we also provide other applications services such as application assessment and evaluation  hardware and architecture consulting  systems integration  and web based services 
business process services business process services include services such as claims processing  life insurance policy administration  call center management  payment and settlement management  security  and services to improve the collection of receivables 
in addition  business process services include engineering support and other technical and administrative services that we provide to the us federal government 

table of contents consulting services consulting services include strategy consulting  enterprise consulting  technology consulting  and research 
the consulting services provided to customers within our industry solutions segment typically consist of customized  industry specific business solutions provided by associates with industry expertise  as well as the implementation of prepackaged software applications 
consulting services are typically viewed as discretionary services by our customers  with the level of business activity depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific customer needs 
our contracts our contracts include services priced using a wide variety of pricing mechanisms 
in determining how to price our services  we consider the delivery  credit and pricing risk of a business relationship 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue was from fixed price contracts where our customers pay us a set amount for contracted services 
for some of these fixed price contracts  the price will be set so that the customer realizes immediate savings in relation to their current expense for the services we will be performing 
on contracts of this nature  our profitability generally increases over the term of the contract as we become more efficient 
the time that it takes for us to realize these efficiencies can range from a few months to a few years  depending on the complexity of the services 
approximately of our revenue was from cost plus contracts where our billings are based in part on the amount of expense we incur in providing services to a customer 
our largest cost plus contract is with ubs ag  which is our largest customer 
as discussed below under expected effect of the end of our outsourcing contract with ubs  our contract with ubs will end january  approximately of our revenue was from time and materials contracts where our billings are based on measurements such as hours  days or months and an agreed upon rate 
in some cases  the rate the customer pays for a unit of time can vary over the term of a contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
approximately of our revenue was from per unit pricing where we bill our customers based on the volumes of units provided at the unit rate specified 
in some contracts  the per unit prices may vary over the term of the contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
we also utilize other pricing mechanisms  including license fees and risk reward relationships where we participate in the benefit associated with delivering a certain outcome 
revenue from these other pricing mechanisms totaled less than of our revenue 
depending on a customer s business requirements and the pricing structure of the contract  the amount of cash generated from a contract can vary significantly during a contract s term 
with fixed or unit priced contracts or when an upfront payment is made to purchase assets or as a sales incentive  an outsourcing services contract will typically produce less cash at the beginning of the contract with significantly more cash being generated as efficiencies are realized later in the term 
with a cost plus contract  the amount of cash generated tends to be relatively consistent over the term of the contract 
our lines of business we offer our services under three primary lines of business industry solutions  government services  and applications solutions formerly known as technology services 
we consider these three lines of business to be reportable segments and include financial information and disclosures about these reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements 
you can find this financial information in note  segment and certain geographic data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements below 
we routinely evaluate the historical performance of and growth prospects for various areas of our business  including our lines of business  vertical industry groups  and service offerings 
based on a quantitative and 
table of contents qualitative analysis of varying factors  we may increase or decrease the amount of ongoing investment in each of these business areas  make acquisitions that strengthen our market position  or divest  exit  or downsize aspects of a business area 
during the past several years  we have used acquisitions to strengthen our service offerings for applications development and maintenance and business process services 
results of operations overview of our financial results for our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including broad economic conditions  the amount and type of technology spending by our customers  and the business strategies and financial condition of our customers and the industries we serve  which could result in increases or decreases in the amount of services that we provide to our customers and the pricing of such services 
our ability to identify and effectively respond to these factors is important to our future financial growth 
we evaluate our consolidated performance on the basis of several performance indicators 
the four key performance indicators we use are revenue growth  earnings growth  free cash flow  and the value of contracts signed 
we compare these key performance indicators to both annual target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we establish the targets for these key performance indicators primarily on an annual basis  but we may revise them during the year 
we assess our performance using these key indicators on a quarterly and annual basis 
revenue growth revenue growth is a measure of the growth we generate through sales of services to new customers  retention of existing contracts  acquisitions  and discretionary services from existing customers 
revenue for grew by as compared to as discussed in more detail below  this revenue growth came primarily from the following revenue from new contracts signed during for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in and from new contracts signed in an increase in revenue from the expansion of base services and discretionary technology investments by our existing long term customers  which we believe was due to improved economic conditions 
revenue from companies acquired in within our commercial solutions group and government services segment 
earnings growth we measure earnings growth using diluted earnings per share  which is a measure of our effectiveness in delivering profitable growth 
diluted earnings per share for increased to per share from per share for as discussed in more detail below  this increase came primarily from a settlement payment related to a dispute with a former customer 
an overall net increase in profitability for existing commercial customer contracts signed prior to  which was primarily due to an increase in the amount of services we perform that are in addition to our base level of services 
these increased services are discretionary in nature  and the associated margins are typically higher than those we realize on our base level of services 
a decrease in expense in for bonuses to associates 
partially offsetting these increases in earnings were operating losses on a certain customer contract and an increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  to as compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december  of 

table of contents we continue to see prospective customers desiring fixed and per unit pricing mechanisms for the billing of our outsourcing services 
while these pricing mechanisms typically impact the initial profit margins on new contracts  they do not necessarily affect the overall expected profitability of new contracts 
free cash flow we calculate free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment and purchased software  as stated in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we use free cash flow as a measure of our ability to generate cash for both our short term and long term operating and business expansion needs 
we use a twelve month period to measure our success in this area because of the significant variations that typically occur on a quarterly basis due to the timing of certain cash payments 
free cash flow for the twelve months ended december   was million as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  free cash flow  which is a non gaap measure  can be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in millions twelve months ended december net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow free cash flow for decreased as compared to due primarily to an increase in purchases of property  equipment and purchased software 
this increase was primarily related to our business expansion needs for data center and office facilities 
tcv of contracts signed the amount of total contract value commonly referred to as tcv that we sell during a twelve month period is a measure of our success in capturing new business in the various outsourcing and consulting markets in which we provide services and includes contracts with new customers and contracts for new services with existing customers 
we measure tcv as our estimate of the total expected revenue from contracts that are expected to generate revenue in excess of a defined amount during a contract term that exceeds a defined length of time 
various factors may impact the timing of the signing of contracts with customers  including the complexity of the contract  competitive pressures  and customer demands 
as a result  we generally measure our success in this area over a twelve month period because of the significant variations that typically occur in the amount of tcv signed during each quarterly period 
during the twelve month period ending december   the amount of tcv signed was billion  as compared to billion for the twelve month period ending december  in january  we signed a customer contract with tcv of billion 
additional measurements each of our three primary lines of business has distinct economic factors  business trends  and risks that could affect our results of operations 
as a result  in addition to the four metrics discussed above that we use to measure our consolidated financial performance  we use similar metrics for each of these lines of business and for certain industry groups and operating units within these lines of business 
changes in accounting principles change in accounting principle for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below in critical accounting policies under the heading revenue recognition  we changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing 
table of contents and prospective customers 
our adoption of eitf effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled receivables associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
change in accounting principle upon adoption of fin effective december   we adopted the consolidation requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  which changes the criteria for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  fin may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
in june  we entered into an operating lease contract with a variable interest entity for the use of land and office buildings in plano  texas  including a data center facility 
as part of our adoption of fin  we consolidated this entity beginning on december   which resulted in an increase in assets and long term debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or 
per diluted share  representing primarily the cumulative depreciation expense on the office buildings and data center facility through december  termination of a business relationship in  we entered into a long term fixed price it outsourcing contract with a customer that included various non construction services and a construction service  which was an application development project 
in  we began to expect that the actual cost to complete the application development project would exceed the cost estimate included in the contract with the customer 
the contract provided for us to collect most of the excess of the actual cost over the cost estimate in the contract  but we expected the project to generate a loss because we did not expect to collect all of the excess 
however  we did not recognize a loss on the contract at that time 
as discussed below under revenue recognition in our critical accounting policies discussion  prior to the adoption of eitf we recorded revenue and profit on our fixed price contracts that included both construction and non construction services using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
therefore  because we expected that the contract would be profitable in the aggregate over its term  we did not recognize a loss on this contract in as part of our adoption of eitf in the first quarter of  we were required to separate the deliverables in the contract into multiple units of accounting 
as a result  we recognized a net estimated loss on the application development project totaling approximately million approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  which was recorded as part of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the million loss on the application development project is composed of two adjustments the reversal of million of revenue and profit that was recognized prior to january   to adjust our cumulative revenue from this contract to the amount that would have been recorded if we had applied the percentage of completion method only to the application development unit of accounting 

table of contents the recording of a future estimated loss of million as of january   which was calculated as the difference between the estimated amount that we expected to collect from the customer and the estimated costs to complete the application development project 
in the second quarter of  we were unable to reach agreement with the customer on the timing and form of payment for the excess 
as a result  we exited this contract and recorded an additional million of expense in direct cost of services in the second quarter of  which consisted of the following the impairment of assets related to this contract totaling million  including the impairment of million of long term accrued revenue 
the accrual of estimated costs to exit this contract of million 
partially offsetting the above expenses was the reversal of million in accrued liabilities that had been recognized for future losses that we expected to incur to complete the application development project 
we completed the services necessary to transition certain functions back to the customer during the fourth quarter of in  we filed a claim in arbitration to recover amounts we believed were due under this contract  and the other party filed counterclaims 
in the second quarter of  we settled this dispute  which resulted in a payment to us of million and a reduction of liabilities of million  both of which were recorded as a reduction to direct cost of services in comparison of to revenue revenue for increased from revenue for due to increases in revenue from the industry solutions  government services  and applications solutions segments 
below is a summary of our revenue for as compared to amounts in millions year ended december change change industry solutions government services applications solutions elimination of intersegment revenue total industry solutions the net increase in revenue from the industry solutions segment for as compared to was primarily attributable to million increase from contracts signed with new customers during for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in this increase was composed of million and million from contracts signed in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these new customers are primarily the same type of services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
million net increase from existing accounts and short term project work 
this net increase resulted from expanding our base services to existing long term customers and from providing additional discretionary services to these customers 
the discretionary services that we provide  which include short term offerings and project work  can vary from period to period depending on many factors  including specific customer and industry needs and economic conditions 
this increase was primarily related to contracts in the healthcare industry 

table of contents million increase from revenue related to an acquisition within our commercial solutions group in the third quarter of the acquired company is a leading provider of policy administration and business process services to the life insurance and annuity industry 
million increase from contracts signed with new customers during this increase was composed of million and million from new contracts signed in the commercial solutions and healthcare groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these new customers are primarily the same type of services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
the state of change in the healthcare industry has required increased system investment  which creates demand for our services 
because of the complexities associated with system changes  combined with our customers desire to focus on core functions  the healthcare outsourcing market has experienced increased levels of business 
the strength in healthcare revenue comes primarily from two factors our solutions for the healthcare market were developed over several years and are highly customized to the specific business needs of the market 
we identified certain aspects of the healthcare market as core to our long term service offerings several years ago when the market for technology and business process services was immature 
as a result  we have an established presence and brand  which we have strengthened through internal investment in software and solutions and through acquisitions 
the healthcare industry continues to be in a state of change as health systems look to transform their clinical and administrative back office operations  payer organizations work to develop new consumer based health models  and as the rate of medical cost inflation continues to be high 
clinical transformation revolutionizes the way in which the healthcare community receives patient specific data that spans the entire continuum of care  including centralization of patient data and electronic order entry and decision support 
the increase in revenue from the markets served by our commercial solutions group was primarily the result of revenue from contracts signed with new customers during  for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in  and an increase in discretionary spending from existing customers  including ubs 
government services the million  or  net increase in revenue from the government services segment for as compared to was primarily attributable to existing program expansion  including our support of the national institute of allergic and infectious diseases  the naval sea systems command and services provided to other governmental agencies  coupled with new services provided to the departments of education and energy 
partially offsetting these increases was a loss of business in the second half of  the majority of which came from the loss of a contract with us citizenship and immigration services that was rebundled by the customer along with other programs for a recompetition bid 
the consortium of companies with which we participated for the recompete did not win this business 
our business with the federal government will fluctuate due to annual federal funding limits and the specific needs of the federal agencies we serve 
applications solutions revenue from the applications solutions segment of million for  net of the elimination of intersegment revenue of million  increased million as compared to revenue of million for  net of the elimination of intersegment revenue of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the demand for application development and maintenance services from customers in the financial services industry 
intersegment revenue relates to the provision of services by the applications solutions segment to the industry solutions segment 

table of contents ubs revenue from ubs  our largest customer  was million for  or of our total revenue 
this revenue was reported within the industry solutions and applications solutions lines of business and is summarized in the following table amounts in millions year ended december change ubs revenue in industry solutions ubs revenue in applications solutions total revenue from ubs the increase in revenue from ubs was due primarily to an increase in the number of associates providing services to ubs relating to their business expansion and various short term projects 
domestic revenue domestic revenue grew by in to  million from  million in this increase was primarily the result of revenue growth within the industry solutions segment 
domestic revenue growth for our industry solutions segment came primarily from the healthcare industry  where we experienced a strong demand as described above  and from the acquisition within our commercial solutions group 
non domestic revenue non domestic revenue  consisting primarily of european and asian operations  increased by in to million from million in asian operations generated revenue of million in as compared to million in  and this increase was primarily from the applications solutions operations in india as a result of an increase in the amount of intersegment services it provides domestic customers through subcontracts with our industry solutions segment 
the largest components of our european operations are in the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for increased to million from million primarily due to increases in revenue from our applications solutions segment from customers in the financial services markets  as well as an increase in revenue from ubs 
in switzerland  revenue declined slightly to million for from million for gross margin gross margin  which is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue  for was of revenue  which is higher than the gross margin for of 
this year to year increase in gross margin was primarily due to the following in the second quarter of  we settled a dispute with a former customer 
as a result  we received a million payment and reduced our liabilities by million  both of which were recorded as a reduction to direct cost of services 
the dispute related to a contract we exited in this settlement resulted in a percentage point increase in our gross margin for a reduction in the amount of total associate bonus expense recorded in direct cost of services 
in  we recorded million of expense for associate bonuses  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of in  we recorded million of expense for associate bonuses  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of an overall net increase in profitability for existing commercial customer contracts signed prior to  which was primarily due to an increase in the amount of services we perform that are in addition to our base level of services 
the increased services are discretionary in nature  and the associated gross margins are typically higher than those we realize on our base level of services 
as discussed above  we have seen increased demand for discretionary investment from several customers  primarily in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups 

table of contents partially offsetting these increases was an million loss on a commercial solutions contract  which included a million loss related to the impairment of certain deferred contract costs 
this loss relates to an infrastructure services contract we signed in and began transitioning services in after signing the contract  we discovered that the size and complexity of the infrastructure of this customer were significantly greater than was originally disclosed to us 
as a result  we have significantly exceeded our cost expectations on this contract 
in addition  our service levels have also not met expectations  which was partially caused by the unanticipated complexity 
the contract provides for additional resource charges  but the customer is disputing substantially all of these additional charges  and therefore we are not recognizing the revenue related to these additional charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in as a percentage of revenue  sg a for was of revenue  which was lower than sg a for of of revenue 
this decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense relating to the intangible assets recorded from our acquisition of tsi  which declined million in  and a continued emphasis on controlling incremental sg a associated with revenue growth 
other income statement items interest income for increased by million as compared to due primarily to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during as compared to interest expense for increased by million as compared to because of an increase in the variable interest rate on our debt 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december  income tax expense for included million of income tax expense on million of foreign earnings repatriated pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the act 
income tax expense for also included a net increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million 
income tax expense for included a net decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million and a reduction of million relating to the resolution of various outstanding tax issues from prior years 
the act created a temporary incentive through december   for us companies to repatriate income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction on qualifying foreign dividends 
all funds repatriated under the act were invested in the us under a qualifying domestic reinvestment plan approved by our management and board of directors 
comparison of to acquisition of perot systems tsi bv as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  on december   we acquired hcl technologies shares in hcl perot systems bv  and changed the name of hps to perot systems tsi bv  which now operates as our applications solutions line of business 
because of the late december closing of this acquisition  the post acquisition results of operations of tsi were not material to our consolidated results of operations for as a result  we continued to account for tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december   and the balance of our investment in tsi at december   was million 
we consolidated the assets and liabilities of tsi as of december  
table of contents revenue revenue for increased from revenue for due to increases in revenue from the industry solutions  government services  and applications solutions segments 
below is a summary of our revenue for as compared to amounts in millions year ended december change change industry solutions government services applications solutions elimination of intersegment revenue and other total percentage change is not meaningful 
industry solutions the net increase in revenue from the industry solutions segment for as compared to was primarily attributable to million increase from contracts signed during for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in this revenue included million and million from contracts signed in in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these customers are primarily the same type of services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
million increase from contracts signed during this revenue included million and million from new contracts signed in the healthcare and commercial solutions groups  respectively 
the services that we are providing to these new customers are primarily the same type of services that we provide to the majority of our other long term outsourcing customers 
the strength in healthcare new sales revenue came primarily from the reasons discussed above in our comparison of to revenue 
million net increase from existing accounts  short term offerings  and project work 
this net increase resulted from expanding our base services to existing long term customers and from providing additional discretionary services to these customers 
the discretionary services that we provide  which include short term offerings and project work  can vary from period to period depending on many factors  including specific customer and industry needs and economic conditions 
the majority of this increase was related to contracts in the healthcare industry 
million increase from technology and business consulting services and business process services  primarily due to an increase in business volume 
both business volume and pricing directly impact our revenue and are indicators of the value we bring to customers  as well as the competitive environment for our services 
therefore  because our direct costs are relatively fixed from period to period  changes in utilization and billing rates can affect our profitability 
for  utilization increased while the average billing rate remained flat 
the increase in utilization came primarily as a result of an increase in discretionary spending by our customers  which we believe was due to an overall improvement in economic conditions 
our services are typically viewed as discretionary services by our customers and tend to be tied to their level of systems investment  which varies with the rate of technology change and general economic conditions 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in revenue associated with three customer contract changes 
as discussed above in termination of a business relationship  we exited an under performing contract during the second quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in revenue in 
table of contents as compared to additionally  we completed two contract renewals that resulted in a revenue reduction of million for as compared to  primarily relating to reductions in price 
although both of these contract renewals included price reductions  the circumstances for these reductions differ for the two contract renewals 
for one of these renewals  we were realizing higher than normal profit margins primarily because our contract pricing included the recovery of a significant investment that was made at the beginning of the contract 
when the customer was acquired by another company  we signed a new long term services agreement with a reduced scope of services  less up front investment  and a corresponding reduction in price 
for the second renewal  the customer agreed to enter into a long term arrangement for services that we were performing on a short term basis 
the long term commitment reduced our risk on the contract  and therefore we reduced the price 
government services the million  or  increase in revenue from the government services segment for as compared to was primarily attributable to new contracts and existing program expansion with the department of homeland security  the department of defense  and civilian agencies of the federal government 
for the contracts underlying this revenue increase  we are providing program management  administrative  professional  and engineering services related both to a recently awarded program by the department of homeland security and from existing programs where specific initiatives of the government required additional resources for as compared to our business with the federal government may fluctuate due to annual federal funding limits and the specific needs of the federal agencies we serve 
the remaining year to year increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of soza company  ltd 
in february as we recognized approximately million of additional revenue in resulting from a full year of revenue in our financial statements 
applications solutions as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  in late december we acquired perot systems tsi bv  which is operating as our applications solutions segment 
we continued to account for tsi s results of operations using the equity method of accounting through december  revenue from this segment was million for  net of the elimination of intersegment revenue of million 
ubs revenue from ubs  our largest customer  was million for  or of revenue 
this revenue was reported within the industry solutions and applications solutions lines of business and is summarized in the following table amounts in millions year ended december change ubs revenue in industry solutions ubs revenue in applications solutions total revenue from ubs percentage change is not meaningful 
the increase in revenue from ubs was due primarily to the acquisition of tsi  as discussed above  which is included in the applications solutions line of business 
domestic revenue domestic revenue grew by in to  million from  million in this increase was primarily the result of revenue growth within the industry solutions and government services segments 
domestic revenue growth for our industry solutions segment came primarily from the healthcare industry  
table of contents where we experienced a strong demand as described above 
in addition  domestic revenue growth for our government services segment came primarily from new contracts and existing program expansion with the department of homeland security  the department of defense  and civilian agencies of the federal government as well as from approximately million of additional revenue related to the acquisition of soza company  ltd 
in february for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in non domestic revenue non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  increased by in to million from million in asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in  and this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of tsi 
the largest components of our european operations are in the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for increased to million from million 
in switzerland  revenue for increased to million from million for both of these increases in revenue were due primarily to the acquisition of tsi 
gross margin gross margin  which is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue  for was of revenue  which is higher than the gross margin for of 
this year to year increase in gross margin was primarily due to the following an overall net increase in profitability for existing commercial customer contracts  which was primarily due to an increase in the amount of services we perform that are in addition to our base level of services 
the increased services are discretionary in nature  and the associated gross margins are typically higher than those we realize on our base level of services 
as discussed above  we have seen increased demand for discretionary investment from several customers  primarily in the healthcare industry 
as discussed above in termination of a business relationship  in the second quarter of  we recorded million of expense in direct costs of services associated with the exiting of this contract 
in december  we acquired tsi  which typically realizes higher gross margins than what we normally realize on traditional it outsourcing contracts because the nature of the services they provide are primarily offshore application development and management services and business process services 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in direct costs of services of million for associate bonus expense  which included an increase in associate bonus expense of approximately million that was reimbursable by our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in sg a for was of revenue  which was higher than sg a for of of revenue 
this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tsi  which added million of sg a expense in included in sg a for tsi was million related to amortization of intangibles 
sg a also increased due to an increase in associate bonus expense of million and an increase of million in expenses associated with corporate compliance and business insurance 
during  we recorded a reduction of sg a expense of million resulting from revising our estimate of liabilities associated with actions in prior years to streamline our operations  which included a favorable resolution of an employment dispute 

table of contents other income statement items interest expense for increased by million as compared to this increase was primarily related to the debt we recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   upon adoption of fin during  we recorded a million equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates  which primarily represented our equity in the net loss of tsi formerly known as hps 
tsi s net loss in was due primarily to the recording of stock option compensation expense  which resulted from the modifications of various stock options and negatively impacted our equity in tsi s earnings by approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
our effective tax rate for income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december   was 
the tax rate for was lower than the rate for due to the impact of our foreign operations  including applications solutions  which has tax holidays in certain asian jurisdictions exempting specific types of income from taxation  a decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million  and a reduction in income tax expense of million relating to the resolution of various outstanding tax issues from prior years 
contract related matters we have a contract that includes both non construction services and construction services  and the construction services relate to a software development and implementation project 
in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  we determined that we could not recognize revenue on the software development and implementation project separately from the non construction services 
as a result  we are deferring both the revenue on the software development and implementation project  consisting of the amounts we are billing for those services  and the related costs  up to the relative fair value of the software development and implementation project 
as of december  and  we have deferred contract costs  net  of million and million  respectively  relating to this contract 
the amount of revenue that has been deferred on the software development and implementation project as of december  and  was million and million  respectively  and was included in non current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
we expect the total cost of the software development and implementation project will exceed its relative fair value 
actual costs in excess of the relative fair value of the software development and implementation project will be expensed as incurred to direct cost of services 
we currently expect the expense included in direct cost of services for these excess costs to be approximately million in each quarterly period in and and to continue beyond at levels that are currently uncertain 
the amount of excess costs in all future periods will depend on various factors  including our success in implementing the software system and our ability to negotiate additional billings for a portion of these excess costs 
we also currently expect the future services under the contract  which includes both the construction and the non construction services  will be profitable and generate positive net cash flows in the aggregate over the remaining contract term 
however  the scope of future services that we provide and the amount of future profits and cash flows from the contract may differ from our current estimates  which could result in an impairment of a portion of the deferred contract costs  and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we also have a contract that was signed in that we began transitioning services in after signing the contract  we discovered that the size and complexity of the infrastructure of this customer were significantly greater than was originally disclosed to us 
as a result  we have significantly exceeded our cost expectations on this contract 
in addition  our service levels have also not met expectations  which was partially caused by the unanticipated complexity 
the contract provides for additional resource charges  but the customer is disputing substantially all of these additional charges  and therefore we are not recognizing the revenue related to these additional charges 
as a result  we incurred a million loss on this contract in the fourth quarter of  which included a million loss related to the impairment of certain deferred contract costs 
we are in discussions with the customer regarding this matter and will work aggressively to resolve it 
while we currently expect the losses from this contract to continue  we expect that the amount of 
table of contents such losses will be less in future quarters than the million loss incurred in the fourth quarter of however  the amount of future quarterly losses may differ from our current expectations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
expected effect of the end of our outsourcing contract with ubs ubs ag is our largest customer 
during  our ubs relationship generated million  or  of our revenue  which included million of revenue and million of gross profit from our outsourcing agreement with ubs that will end on january  we expect revenue and gross profit for from our outsourcing contract with ubs to be approximately million and million  respectively 
we continue to expect that we will lose substantially all of our revenue and profit from our outsourcing agreement with ubs when the contract ends on january   which represents a substantial majority of the total revenue and profit from our relationship with ubs 
we expect that the expiration of the outsourcing agreement likely will have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability compared to the effect on our revenue 
we expect the services we provide to ubs following the end of the it services agreement will include offshore services  which are provided outside the scope of the outsourcing contract and currently represent million of annual revenue 
we do not expect significant changes in the offshore services we provide to ubs following the end of the outsourcing contract 
possible changes in our relationship with harvard pilgrim we previously disclosed that harvard pilgrim  one of our largest customers  had notified us that it intended to transition the services that we provide them to its new business partner prior to the end of however  based on recent developments with this customer  we no longer expect this contract to end in we now expect to continue to provide services to harvard pilgrim after  although likely at a reduced amount and under a new long term contract 
liquidity and capital resources we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operating activities  and the million available under the restated and amended revolving credit facility  which is discussed below  will provide us sufficient funds to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future

in addition  depreciation and amortization expense  which are non cash expenses  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in as compared to was due primarily to depreciation and amortization expense on property  equipment  and purchased software and intangible assets associated with tsi  which was acquired in december we typically collect our accounts receivable within days to days  and therefore our accounts receivable balance at the end of each period can change based on the amount of revenue for that period and the timing of collections from our customers  which can vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents during  our revenue increased as compared to  while our days sales outstanding increased from days at december   to days at december   which resulted in a million use of cash in from our accounts receivable balances 
days sales outstanding is calculated as our outstanding accounts receivable balance at the end of the year divided by revenue for the fourth quarter and multiplied by days 
days sales outstanding as of december   was days

during  we increased our spending on deferred contract costs by million as compared to and by million as compared to deferred contract costs are included in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
partially offsetting this increase in spending was an increase in deferred revenue  which is included in deferred revenue and non current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million for and million for these changes in cash used in investing activities were primarily attributable to the following during  we paid million for acquisitions  including million net of cash received for the acquisition of technical management  inc and its subsidiaries  including transaction applications group  inc  million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of soza company  ltd  million net of cash received for the acquisition of prsm corporation  million as additional consideration related to the acquisition of adi technology corporation  and million related to the acquisition of one other company 
during  we purchased million of property  equipment and purchased software as compared to million during and million during this increase was primarily related to our business expansion needs for data center and office facilities 
we plan to significantly increase our data center capacity in the next to months  which could increase our future capital expenditures from current levels and reduce the amount of our available cash balances and borrowing capacity

current portion of long term debt in june  we entered into an operating lease contract with a variable interest entity for the use of land and office buildings in plano  texas  including a data center facility 
as part of our adoption of fin  we began consolidating this entity beginning on december  upon consolidation  we recorded the debt between the variable interest entity and the financial institutions the lenders of million as long term debt at december   on our consolidated balance sheets 
the debt bore interest at libor plus basis points for of the outstanding balance while the remaining was charged interest at libor plus basis points 
the agreement was to mature in june with one optional two year extension  however  we did not extend the agreement 
as a result  the amount outstanding of million was recorded as the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  in march  we borrowed million under our credit facility to pay the exercise amount of million 
table of contents for the purchase option under the operating lease and certain other expenses 
our consolidated variable interest entity then repaid the amount due to the lenders 
credit facility in january  we entered into a three year credit facility with a syndicate of banks that allows us to borrow up to million 
in march  we executed a restated and amended agreement that expanded the facility to million and extended the term to five years 
borrowings under the credit facility will be either through loans or letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  we have pledged the stock of one of our non domestic subsidiaries as security on the facility 
interest on borrowings varies with usage and begins at an alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facility agreement  or the libor rate plus an applicable spread based upon our debt ebitda ratio applicable on such date 
we are also required to pay a facility fee based upon the unused credit commitment and certain other fees related to letter of credit issuance 
the credit facility matures in march and requires certain financial covenants  including a debt ebitda ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio  each as defined in the credit facility agreement 
as discussed above  in march we borrowed million against the credit facility

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services to our customers under contracts that contain various pricing mechanisms and other terms 
these services include infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
within these four categories of services  our contracts include non construction service deliverables  including infrastructure services and business process services  and construction service deliverables  such as application development and implementation services 

table of contents accounting for revenue in single deliverable arrangements revenue for non construction service deliverables is recognized as the services are delivered in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which provides that revenue should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under our policy  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when a final understanding between us and our customer exists as to the specific nature and terms of the services that we are going to provide  as documented in the form of a signed agreement between us and the customer 
revenue for non construction services priced under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the longer of the term of the contract or the expected service period  regardless of the amounts that can be billed in each period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or our obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
if we are to provide a similar level of non construction services each period during the term of a contract  we would recognize the revenue on a straight line basis since our obligations are being fulfilled in a straight line pattern 
if our obligations are being fulfilled in a pattern that is not consistent over the term of a contract  then we would recognize revenue consistent with the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period 
in determining the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period  we consider the nature of the deliverables we are providing to the customer and whether the volumes of those deliverables are easily measured  such as when we provide a contractual number of full time equivalent associate resources 
if the amount of our obligations fulfilled in each period is not easily distinguished by reference to the volumes of services provided  then we would recognize revenue on a straight line basis 
revenue for construction services that do not include a license to one of our software products is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  sop requires the use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as our work progresses  and we primarily use hours incurred to date to measure our progress towards completion 
this method relies on estimates of total expected hours to complete the construction service  which are compared to hours incurred to date  to arrive at an estimate of how much revenue and profit has been earned to date 
although we primarily measure our progress towards completion using hours incurred to date  we may measure our progress towards completion using costs incurred to date if the construction services involve a significant amount of non labor costs 
because these estimates may require significant judgment  depending on the complexity and length of the construction services  the amount of revenue and profits that have been recognized to date are subject to revisions 
if we do not accurately estimate the amount of hours or costs required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then revenue and profits may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenue for the sale of a license to one of our software products or the sale of services relating to a software license is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
in general  sop addresses the separation and the timing of revenue recognition for software and software related services  such as implementation and maintenance services 
sop also requires the application of the percentage of completion method as described in sop for those software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software 
as a result  the accounting for revenue related to software arrangements includes many of the estimates and significant judgments discussed above 
revenue for services priced under time and materials contracts and unit priced contracts is recognized as the services are provided at the contractual unit price 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements prior to the adoption of eitf prior to our adoption of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  effective january  as discussed 
table of contents below  we accounted for revenue from arrangements containing both non construction and construction services on a combined basis 
for such arrangements with both non construction and construction services  we recognized revenue and profit on all services combined using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the provisions of sop  using costs incurred to date to measure our progress towards completion 
adoption of eitf on november   the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf regarding when an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
we were required to apply the provisions of eitf to all new arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  alternatively  we were permitted to apply eitf to existing arrangements and record the effect of adoption as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted eitf and changed our method of accounting for revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables for both existing and prospective customer contracts 
our adoption of eitf effective january   resulted in an expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share 
this adjustment resulted primarily from the reversal of unbilled receivables associated with our long term fixed price contracts that include construction services  as each such contract had been accounted for as a single unit of accounting under the percentage of completion method using direct costs incurred to date as a measure of progress towards completion 
the direct costs incurred in providing the services under these long term fixed price contracts were greater in the early years of the contract as compared to the later years because of the additional construction and non construction services being performed in those early years  including the implementation of new technologies and re engineering of processes 
however  the contract terms did not allow for us to bill separately for the majority of these additional services  including the construction services 
as a result  we were recognizing revenue in advance of the billings 
upon the adoption of eitf  we determined that the construction and non construction services would not satisfy the separation criteria of eitf  and therefore we were required to account for these services as a single unit of accounting and apply the most appropriate revenue recognition method to the entire arrangement  which was the straight line method 
since the majority of the billings on the affected contracts approximated the straight line method  we were required to reverse most of the unbilled receivables that we had recorded in advance of the customer billings 
this adjustment also included approximately million approximately million  net of the applicable income tax benefit  or per diluted share  to recognize an estimated loss on a construction service included in a contract that we expected to be profitable in the aggregate over its term and that was accounted for as a single unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method 
this contract is discussed further in note  termination of business relationships 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements subsequent to the adoption of eitf for those arrangements that contain both non construction and construction services  we first determine whether each service  or deliverable  meets the separation criteria of eitf in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each unit of accounting as described previously based on the 
table of contents nature of the arrangement and the services included in each unit of accounting 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are combined into one unit of accounting  and the most appropriate revenue recognition method is applied 
in arrangements for both non construction and construction services  we may bill the customer prior to performing services  which would require us to record deferred revenue 
in other arrangements  we may perform services prior to billing the customer  which could require us to record unbilled receivables or to defer the costs associated with either the non construction or construction services  depending on the terms of the arrangement and the application of the revenue separation criteria of eitf in certain arrangements we may pay consideration to the customer at the beginning of a contract as an incentive  which is most commonly in the form of cash 
this consideration is recorded in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the related contract 
as a result of our adoption of eitf  we recognized revenue of approximately million  million  and million during   and  respectively  that were recognized prior to under our accounting for revenue prior to the adoption of eitf and were also included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which we recorded in the first quarter of these amounts were estimated as the amount by which unbilled receivables would have been reduced under the previous accounting principle in these periods for all remaining contracts impacted by the cumulative adjustment  based on the percentage of completion computations that were prepared immediately prior to our adoption of eitf contract costs costs to deliver services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of setup costs and the cost of certain construction and non construction services for which the related revenue must be deferred under eitf or other accounting literature 
we defer and subsequently amortize certain setup costs related to activities that enable us to provide the contracted services to customers 
deferred contract setup costs may include costs incurred during the setup phase of a customer arrangement relating to data center migration  implementation of certain operational processes  employee transition  and relocation of key personnel 
we amortize deferred contract setup costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related contract 
useful lives range from three years up to a maximum of the term of the related customer contract 
for a construction service in a single deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the total amount that can be billed under the terms of the arrangement  then a loss would generally be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable 
for a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the amount of revenue that is allocated to the separate construction service unit of accounting based on the relative fair value allocation  as limited to the amount that is not contingent  then the actual costs incurred to complete the construction service in excess of the allocated fair value would be deferred  up to the amount of the relative fair value  and amortized over the remaining term of the contract 
a loss would generally be recorded on a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement if the total costs to complete the service exceed the relative fair value of the service 
deferred contract costs are evaluated for realizability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable 
our evaluation is based on the amount of non refundable deferred revenue that is related to the deferred contract costs and our projection of the remaining net gross profits from the related customer contract 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the deferred contract costs is greater than the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and the remaining net gross profits from the customer contract  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and remaining net gross profits 

table of contents year end bonus plan one of our compensation methods is to pay to certain associates a year end bonus  which is based on associate and team performance  our financial results  and management s discretion 
the amount of bonus expense that we record each quarter is based on several factors  including our financial performance for that quarter  our latest expectations for full year results  and management s estimate of the amount of bonus to be paid at the end of the year 
as a result  the amount of bonus expense that we record in each quarter can vary significantly 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is reasonably possible but not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  then we may disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 
the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth at the date of acquisition 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise the estimates and assumptions we used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
income tax expense consists of our current and deferred provisions for us and foreign income taxes 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
based upon our estimates of future taxable income and review of available tax planning strategies  we believe it is more likely than not that only million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance at december   of million relating primarily to foreign jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of this valuation allowance based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for us income tax on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
except for amounts repatriated pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the act  we intend to either permanently invest our non us earnings or remit such earnings in a tax free manner 
the act provided a temporary incentive through december   for us companies to repatriate income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
all funds repatriated under the act were invested in the us under a qualifying domestic reinvestment plan approved 
table of contents by our management and board of directors 
income tax expense for included million of income tax expense on million of foreign earnings repatriated pursuant to the act 
the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes of our non us subsidiaries was approximately million at december   and million at december  such earnings include pre acquisition earnings of non us entities acquired through stock purchases and are intended to be invested outside of the us indefinitely 
the ultimate tax liability related to repatriation of such earnings is dependent upon future tax planning opportunities and is not estimable at the present time 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates  and the application of complex tax regulations 
as a global company  we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to income tax audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  and we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service as well as the uk and indian tax authorities 
we fully cooperate with all audits  but we defend our positions vigorously 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by tax authorities could differ substantially from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
changes to our recorded income tax liabilities resulting from the resolution of tax matters are reflected in income tax expense in the period of resolution 
other factors may cause us to revise our estimates of income tax liabilities including the expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax regulations  and tax rulings 
changes in estimates of income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in our change in estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
significant accounting standards to be adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r in december  the fasb issued fas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fas fas r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  which is allowed under the original provisions of fas fas r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the effective date of fas r is the first annual fiscal period beginning after june  if we had applied the provisions of fas r to the financial statements for the period ending december   net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
fas r allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or modified retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of fas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we plan to apply the provisions of fas r on a modified prospective basis using the black scholes option pricing model for the recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards granted on or after january   and any awards that are not fully vested as of december  compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in preparing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of fas as discussed in note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements under the heading stock based compensation  to reduce future stock option compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated income statements with the adoption of fas r and to further advance our corporate compensation objectives  in november we extended an offer to eligible employees to exchange certain unvested stock options to purchase class a common stock for fully vested replacement stock options to purchase of the original number of shares of our class a common stock 
the stock options that were eligible to be exchanged were only those options to purchase shares of our class a common stock at per share that were scheduled to vest in march of the million stock options eligible for exchange  employees representing approximately of the eligible options accepted the offer  and we granted million fully vested replacement stock options to those 
table of contents employees 
also to reduce future stock option compensation expense  we accelerated the vesting for the remaining million stock options  but the underlying shares resulting from the future exercise of these stock options may not be sold prior to the original vesting date in march as a result of the offer and the acceleration of the remaining million stock options  our pro forma net income and diluted earnings per common share were reduced by million and  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
in may  the fasb issued fas  accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the accounting for and the reporting of voluntary changes in accounting principles 
fas requires changes in accounting principles to be applied retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  where practicable  unless specific transition provisions permit alternative transition methods 
fas will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements except to the extent that we adopt a voluntary change in accounting principle in a future period that must be accounted for through a restatement of previous financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenue and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use foreign currency forward contracts or options to manage exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
our use of foreign currency forward contracts expanded in due to increased foreign currency exposures resulting from our acquisition of the remaining interests in perot systems tsi bv during   or million of our revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
