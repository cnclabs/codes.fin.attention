item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following risk factors  as well as the other information in this form k  before deciding to invest in our shares of common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
if this happens  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the south african social security agency  or sassa  is expected to begin  in the near future the process of conducting a national tender for the award of contracts to distribute social welfare grants 
if we were not to receive contracts to continue to distribute these grants in each of the provinces where we currently distribute them  or if we do win these contracts  but the terms are not as favorable to us as our current contracts  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from contracts to distribute social welfare grants on behalf of five of the nine provincial governments of south africa 
for the foreseeable future  our revenues  results of operations and cash flows will depend on this concentrated group of customers 
during the years ended june   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from payments made to us by these provinces under our government social welfare contracts 
the south african national government created sassa in to consolidate at the central government level the administration of social welfare grants 
sassa has recently begun the process of conducting a national tender for the distribution of social welfare grants in which bidders will have the opportunity to bid for all of south african or on a province by province basis 
in late july  sassa published a request for pre qualification of bidders  or rfq which included a proposed timetable for pre qualifying bidders  distributing requests for proposals  or rfps  from pre qualified bidders and evaluating rfp submissions  indicating that the process should be completed by late november however  in mid august  sassa withdrew the rfq 
sassa did not indicate when it would re publish the rfq or otherwise recommence the tender process 
once sassa recommences the tender process  there can be no assurance that the tender will result in our receiving contracts to continue to distribute social welfare grants in each of the five south african provinces where we currently distribute them 
even if we do receive new contracts  we cannot predict the terms that such contracts will contain 
any new contract we receive may contain pricing or other terms  such as provisions relating to early termination  that are not as favorable to us as the contracts under which we currently operate 
the time and attention required by our management in connection with the tender process and the uncertainty surrounding the tender process may have a disruptive effect on our business 
in addition  although we believe that our existing contracts will be extended if the tender process is not completed on time  there can be no assurance whether such extensions will in fact occur  or if they do  what the length or terms of such extensions will be 
moreover  because we incur a significant portion of the expenses associated with these contracts during the initial implementation phase  we have historically enjoyed higher profit margins on these contracts after the completion of the implementation period  which averages approximately months 
therefore  to the extent that we are not successful in obtaining new provincial contracts  or if a new contract were to be terminated for any reason during the implementation period  our profit margins would also be adversely affected 
finally  if we were to be awarded one or more contracts by sassa  an unsuccessful tenderor could seek to challenge the award  which could result in the contract being set aside or could require us to expend time and resources in an attempt to defeat any such challenge 
for example  the november award to us of the limpopo provincial contract  which was executed in  was challenged by a disqualified bidder for the contract 
a south african court set aside the contract in  although the court s ruling was suspended and the contract was reinstated as a result of an appeal of the ruling by the province 
nevertheless  the court challenge created uncertainty  consumed management time and attention and required us to incur substantial legal expenses 
our strategy of partnering with companies outside south africa may not be successful 
in order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets  it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside south africa 
during fiscal  we established three such partnerships in namibia  botswana and nigeria  and we are currently exploring a number of other opportunities to implement ueps systems and to participate as an investor in these projects 
the success of these endeavors is  however  subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control  such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial  business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations 
in some countries  finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation 
some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a minority interest 
minority ownership carries with it numerous risks  including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits  as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies 
such a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities 
in addition  our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree 
our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in south africa 
furthermore  limitations imposed on new aplitec by south african exchange control regulations  as well as limitations imposed on us by the investment company act of  may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest 
in addition  certain of our licensees  including bgs and visa  have become our competitors and this could occur with our joint venture partners in the future 
we have lost license fees in the cis as a result of a dispute with bgs  the local system operator  which claims that the revocation of the european fts patent relieves it from the obligation to pay us licensee fees 
we believe that the licensing fees due from bgs relate to its use of our ueps technology rather than the fts patent and  therefore  we are currently evaluating our options on this matter 
we will face integration and other challenges associated with our recent acquisition of prism on july   we completed the prism acquisition 
integration of prism s business operations into our own will pose several challenges for us 
we expect that the integration will require significant management time and attention and may disrupt our existing businesses by diverting management away from day to day operations 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the geographical distances between south africa and some of prism s operations which are located on other continents 
we will face challenges associated with integrating different corporate cultures and personnel with disparate business backgrounds 
we may also not be able to maintain prism s key employees or customers or to realize some or all of the cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when we agreed to acquire prism 
in addition  we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  which could reduce our future reported earnings 
we may also have liabilities or experience adverse operating issues that we may have failed to discover during due diligence prior to the acquisition 
as we have only recently completed the prism acquisition  we may not have fully identified all of the risks or other issues that could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition 
we may not maintain our current level of profitability or rates of growth 
we believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following continue to enroll new smart card users and participating merchants in south africa  achieve growth in the number and value of transactions processed using our smart cards  expand our business internationally by properly identifying new markets and business partners for those markets  hire and train personnel capable of marketing  installing and integrating our solution  supporting customers and managing operations  continue to expand the range of applications that use our technology and to market these applications successfully  and manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our technology and expanding our operations internationally 
if we are not able to achieve any or all of the above  our profitability and or growth rate will likely decline 
changes in current government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows 
we derive a substantial portion of our current business from the distribution of social welfare grants onto smart cards in south africa and the transaction fees resulting from use of these smart cards 
because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the government  any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals  or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipients are no longer eligible 
if any of these changes were to occur  the number of smart cards in use could decrease  the amount of money on any particular smart card could decrease or the amount of transactions effected on any particular smart card may decrease  all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and cash flows 
we may have difficulty managing our growth which could limit our ability to increase sales and cash flow 
we have recently been experiencing significant growth  both in the scope of our operations and size of our organization 
this growth is placing significant demands on our management  as well as on our operational resources 
in order to achieve our business objectives  however  we anticipate that we will need this growth to continue 
continued growth would increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems  expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
additionally  continued growth will place significant additional demands on our management and our financial and operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls 
if we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately  we will not experience our projected growth and our financial results may suffer 
there are risks relating to operating in south africa that could adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
our primary operations are located in south africa and we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from our operations in south africa 
as a result  we are subject to any political  economic and regulatory uncertainties in south africa 
the changing political and social environment 
south africa faces certain social  political and economic challenges  which may adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the country is experiencing high levels of unemployment and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people  with large parts of the population  particularly in the rural areas  having limited access to education  healthcare  housing and other basic services 
furthermore  south africa faces challenges in building adequate infrastructure 
these problems  together with a shortage of skilled labor  may in the future have an adverse impact on productivity 
inflation and interest rates 
the economy of south africa is currently characterized by low inflation and interest rates 
as of may  the inflation rate was approximately 
the reserve bank s base lending rate is currently approximately per annum 
however  the economy of south africa in the past has been  and in the future may be  characterized by high rates of inflation and high interest rates 
high rates of inflation could increase our south african based costs and decrease our operating margins 
high interest rates could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost effective debt financing in south africa 
regulatory uncertainty regarding black economic empowerment 
the south african government  over the past five years  has been developing an economic indigenization program referred to as black economic empowerment  or bee 
bee is regulated pursuant to an act of the south african parliament  namely the broad based black economic empowerment act of  or the bbbee act 
the bbbee act recognizes two distinct mechanisms for the achievement of bee objectives codes of good practice issued under the act and sectoral transformation charters developed by specific industry sectors and which may be recognized by the minister of trade and industry if they have been developed by the major stakeholders in the relevant industry and advance the objectives of the bbbee act 
draft codes of good practice have recently been published for public comment  but none of them is  as yet  enforceable 
the information and communication technology sector  or ict sector  and the financial services sector have both developed sectoral transformation charters  but they have not yet been published in the government gazette and  consequently  they do not currently enjoy any formal status 
the ict sector has attempted to ensure as great a degree of comparability between its sectoral transformation charter and the draft codes of good practice  thereby assuring the probable publication of that charter in the government gazette by the minister of trade and industry 
by contrast  there are no indications that the financial services sector has made any attempt to achieve significant alignment between its transformation charter and the draft codes of good practice 
once the codes of good practice become law  all businesses in south africa will be subject to those codes unless they form part of a sector in respect of which the minister of trade and industry has published an industry charter in the government gazette as a code of good practice 
the current uncertainty as to the final form of the regulatory regime poses a risk  but there are indications that the regime will be settled in the next months 
we are likely to be subject to the ict sector s charter if this document is published in the government gazette as a code of good practice 
this charter applies  among others  to companies that manufacture equipment for  or provide services relating to  the electronic capturing  transmission and display of data and information 
compliance with the charter is not enforced through civil or criminal sanction  but only through its effect on the ability to secure contracts in the public and private sectors 
one of the components of bee is that a certain percentage of ownership by black south africans or historically disadvantaged south africans of our south african business should be achieved over a period of time which is generally thought to be ten to years 
although bee is not expropriatory in nature  there may be a dilutive effect to current shareholders in the south african business and there may be a cost associated with increasing the level of black shareholders or historically disadvantaged south africans  both of which factors may represent a risk 
however  given that non bee compliance may place in jeopardy existing and future south african public and private sector contracts  the loss of which could cause a loss of revenue  the attendant risk associated with bee non compliance is material 
exchange control regulation 
south africa s exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from south africa  the republic of namibia and the kingdoms of lesotho and swaziland  known collectively as the common monetary area 
transactions between south african residents  including companies  and non residents of the common monetary area are subject to exchange controls enforced by sarb 
in october  the south african exchange control regulations were liberalized by the abolishment of exchange control limits on new investments outside of south africa by south african companies 
however  according to the circular giving notice of this liberalization  sarb retains an oversight function  the exact nature of which is not entirely clear from the circular 
according to the circular  south african companies investing outside of south africa must now apply to sarb only for monitoring purposes and for the approval of sarb pursuant to existing foreign direct investment criteria  including demonstrated benefit to south africa 
sarb reserves the right to stagger capital outflows relating to very large investments outside of south africa by south african companies  so as to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market 
also  these liberalization measures permit south african companies to retain  outside of south africa  dividends received in relation to shares held by them in non south african companies 
south african exchange controls are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the south african government  however  has committed itself to gradually relaxing exchange controls  and significant relaxations have occurred in recent years 
nevertheless  under the current exchange control regulations  our management may be limited in its ability to consider strategic options and our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares 
although net ueps technologies  inc is a us corporation and is not itself subject to these regulations  the ability of new aplitec to raise and deploy capital outside the common monetary area is restricted 
as of june   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by new aplitec and its subsidiaries 
during the year ended june   substantially all of our revenues were generated by new aplitec and its subsidiaries 
in particular  new aplitec will generally not be permitted to export capital from south africa or to hold foreign currency without the approval of sarb  unless such export of capital or foreign currency holding is permitted by the october liberalization measures 
this restriction may affect new aplitec s ability to pay dividends to net ueps technologies  inc moreover  although the requirement that sarb approve investments by south african companies outside of south africa has been relaxed  this requirement could restrict our future international expansion 
sarb approval is required for new aplitec to receive loans from and repay loans to non residents of the common monetary area 
in addition  new aplitec may not use income earned in south africa to repay or service foreign debts  without sarb s approval 
repayment of principal and interest on such loans will usually be approved at the time of the granting of such loans  where the payment is limited to the amount borrowed and a market related rate of interest 
new aplitec will also need sarb approval to raise capital involving a currency other than south african rand  which approval may be provided subject to conditions 
thus  unless we can obtain funding at the net ueps technologies  inc level  these restrictions could prevent us from obtaining adequate funding on acceptable terms for acquisitions and other business opportunities outside south africa 
trade unions and labor laws 
most of south africa s major industries are unionized  and the majority of employees belong to trade unions 
in the past  trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in south africa in general 
we currently have approximately unionized employees which represents approximately of our workforce 
although in recent years we have not experienced any labor disruptions  such labor disruptions may occur in the future 
in addition  the cost of complying with labor laws may adversely affect our operations 
regional instability 
historically  there has been regional  political  and economic instability in the countries surrounding south africa 
such political or economic instability in neighboring countries could affect the social  political and economic conditions in south africa  for example  as a result of immigration  and this could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our operations in the country 
hiv aids 
hiv aids and tuberculosis  which is exacerbated in the presence of hiv aids  are major healthcare challenges in south africa and other sub saharan countries 
hiv infection among women in antenatal clinics throughout south africa has risen from in to nearly in according to the most recent research published by the medical research council of south africa  over five million south africans were hiv positive in  resulting in a total population prevalence rate of approximately 
under south african law  we are generally prohibited from testing employees to determine their hiv status 
due to the high prevalence of hiv aids in south africa  we may incur costs relating to the loss of personnel and the related loss of productivity as well as the costs relating to recruiting and training of new personnel 
we are not able to quantify these costs accurately and cannot assure you that the costs we will incur in connection with this epidemic will not have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
there are risks relating to other countries in which we intend to operate that could adversely affect our future business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we intend to expand operations into countries and regions  including african countries outside south africa  south america  southeast asia and central europe  that are subject to significantly differing political  economic and market conditions 
specific country and regional risks that may have a material impact on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition include political and economic instability  loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection  competition from existing market participants that may have a longer history in or greater familiarity with the foreign markets we enter  government interventions and protectionism  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including import and export license requirements  tariffs  legal structures and tax laws  cancellation of contractual rights  trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  import and export restrictions  adverse tax consequences  the lack of well developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights  security and safety of employees  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  currency fluctuations  indigenization and empowerment programs  logistical and communications challenges  changes in labor conditions  discrimination against us companies  and exposure to liability under us securities laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act 
many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies 
however  institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world 
many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and  as a result  are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions 
moreover  the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and  therefore  existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner 
as the political  economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development  investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments 
any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
volatility in the south african rand to us dollar exchange rate may adversely affect our reported operating results 
the south african rand  or zar  is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in us dollars 
because our sales are primarily denominated in zar  a decline in the value of the zar against the us dollar may have a significant adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
during the three years ended june   the zar us dollar exchange rate has been volatile  refer to item currency exchange rate information actual exchange rates table and the graph beneath table as a result  although our reported results of operations were positively affected by currency fluctuations for the fiscal year compared to fiscal  these fluctuations adversely affected our reported results for fiscal as compared to fiscal these fluctuations may make it more difficult for investors and others to understand how our business has performed without regard to these currency exchange rate changes 
we expect that exchange rate volatility will continue in the foreseeable future 
trends in sales and profits may experience significant fluctuations as the rate of exchange between the zar and the us dollar fluctuates 
we cannot assure you what effect  if any  changes in the exchange rate of the zar against the us dollar will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not currently engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations  other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in us dollars or euros 
we have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the zar us dollar and zar euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions 
we cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or  if we do  that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations 
the loss of the services of dr 
belamant or any of our other executive officers would adversely affect our business 
our future financial and operational performance depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our chief executive officer and chairman  dr 
serge belamant  as well as mr 
herman kotze  our chief financial officer  ms 
brenda stewart  our senior vice president marketing and sales  and mr 
nitin soma  our senior vice president information technology 
many of our key responsibilities are performed by these four individuals  and the loss of the services of any of them could disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
we do not have employment agreements with our executive officers  any of whom may terminate their employment at any time  nor do we maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees  particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products that use our ueps technology and to market these products to our target users 
in order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts  we need to identify  attract  motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel 
an inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property  to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology 
demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees 
the risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition 
furthermore  social and economic factors in south africa have led  and continue to lead  numerous qualified individuals to leave the country  thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in south africa 
in addition  our multi country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets 
if we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business  it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities 
we pre fund the payment of social welfare grants on behalf of our south african government customers and any payment defaults by these customers would adversely affect our operations 
we use our internal cash resources and facilities to fund the payment of social welfare grants under our contracts with the kwazulu natal and eastern cape provincial governments 
we recover these funds from the kwazulu natal provincial government on a seven day cyclical basis and from the eastern cape provincial government on a day cyclical basis 
therefore  these pre funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by the applicable provincial government 
in addition  the number of social welfare grant beneficiaries in these provinces increased significantly during fiscal  which increased our pre funding requirements 
although no provincial government has ever defaulted on a repayment of funds at the end of the payment cycle  we cannot guarantee that such a default will not occur in the future 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial position and results of operations 
our ability to operate our wage payment and insurance products businesses may be limited by existing south african banking and financial services laws and regulations 
the south african retail banking market is highly regulated  but the south african government has identified the need to service the unbanked market through the liberalization of the regulatory environment in order for retailers and non banking service providers to innovate products and delivery channels for the unbanked market 
however  under current law and regulations  a portion of our south african wage payment business activities in the unbanked market requires us to be registered as a bank in south africa or to have access to an existing banking license 
we are not currently so registered  nor do have access to an existing license  and therefore are not entitled to perform these activities in south africa and may face prosecution if we do 
we have appointed expert advisers to assist us in identifying and executing the most appropriate methodology to obtain access to a license 
while we believe that we will be able to obtain access to this license  there is a possibility that our methodology may not be successful or that a grant of the license may be delayed 
in addition  the south african financial advisory and intermediary services act   requires persons who give advice regarding the purchase of financial products or who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in south africa to register as financial service providers 
we have applied for a license under this act in order to continue to provide advice and intermediary services in respect of the financial products on which we advise and the payment processing services we provide in south africa on behalf of insurers and other financial product suppliers 
while the license application is pending  we are entitled to continue this part of our business in south africa 
if we fail to obtain this license  we may be stopped from continuing this part of our business in south africa 
we may face competition from the incumbent retail banks in south africa in the unbanked market segment 
the incumbent south african retail banks recently announced a joint initiative to create a common banking product to offer to the significant portion of south africa s population that does not have access to traditional banking services  or the unbanked 
this bank account  generally referred to as the mzansi account  was introduced in october and offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges  when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks 
according to the finscope survey  people approximately of the adult population in south africa claim to have an mzanzi account  although the exact number of accounts is unknown 
the social welfare beneficiaries who are currently paid through our smart card system may elect to use these accounts to receive their grants 
a decision by a substantial number of these beneficiaries to elect to use these accounts rather than our smart card system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we may face increased competition as our sales and product offerings increase 
in addition to competition that we face from the use of cash  checks  credit and debit cards  existing payment systems and the providers of financial services  we have identified a number of other products currently being produced that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system and the companies that promote them 
these include emv  a system that is being promoted by visa international service association  mastercard international and europay international  mondex international limited  a subsidiary of mastercard  and proton world international nv  a subsidiary of stmicroelectronics belgium nv in south africa  and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants  our competitors also include allpay consolidated investment holdings pty ltd  which is responsible for social welfare payments in the free state  gauteng and western cape provinces and a small portion of the eastern cape province  and empilweni payout services  which is responsible for payments in the mpumalanga province 
we also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed our technology  including visa and bgs smart card systems ag 
moreover  as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance  banks in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as infringing on their funds transfer or other businesses 
patent competition may adversely affect our products or processes  and limited patent protection  a lack of proprietary protection and the potential to incur costly litigation could be harmful to our operations 
our products and technology have unique characteristics and structures and  as a result  are subject to patent protection  the extent of which varies from country to country 
during the life of a patent  a product is only subject to competition by non infringing products 
however  aggressive patenting by our competitors and potential patent piracy may threaten protected products and processes and may result in an increased patent infringement risk  especially in emerging economies such as those where we currently operate 
the expiration of a patent may also result in increased competition in the market for the previously patented products and processes 
the patents for our fts will expire  at the latest  in namibia in  in south africa  botswana  swaziland and hong kong in  and in the united states in in addition  our european union fts patent has been challenged and revoked 
consequently  we do not have any patent protection in the member countries of the european union 
additionally  we could have difficulty asserting the hong kong patent as it is not registered in our name and it could be difficult to record our ownership of that patent 
further  bgs  the local system operator in the commonwealth of independent states has stopped paying licensing fees to us on the grounds that the revocation of the european fts patent relieves it from the obligation to pay such fees  although we believe that the licensing fees relate to bgs s use of our ueps technology rather than the fts patent 
there is a risk that a similar refusal to pay our licensing fees can occur elsewhere 
moreover  although we have certain patent rights in the united states  these are not expected to have significant utility in our business given that our management does not expect the us market to become a material part of our business in the future 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  to date  we have relied not only on patent protections  but also on trade secret  trademark and copyright laws  as well as nondisclosure  licensing and other contractual arrangements to protect the proprietary aspects of our solutions 
other than the patents discussed above  we do not own any other patents that protect important aspects of our current solutions 
we will  however  prepare patent applications where possible for technology related to our smart cards and ueps system when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
these applications and contractual arrangements and our reliance on these laws may not be successful 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful 
any loss of or inability to protect intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of south africa  namibia  botswana  swaziland  the united states and the european union 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in south africa  namibia  botswana  swaziland  the united states and the european union or any other country in which we operate  may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims 
we may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services  to expend resources to develop non infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third party claims  we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the copyrights and certain related intellectual property rights in earlier versions of our ueps software are jointly owned and potentially subject to non exclusive rights  which may reduce our future revenues 
while we own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the ueps software  these copyrights are subject to the preexisting copyrights in the earlier versions of our software that are owned jointly by us and nedbank 
as joint owners of the copyrights in these earlier versions of our software that existed prior to july  there is a risk that nedbank could license these works to others and otherwise commercially exploit these earlier works 
under our nedbank agreements  nedbank also acquired the right to request a license of our south african and us fts patents and of all technology and know how relating to the ueps described in those earlier patents from us for entities partly owned by nedbank that are located anywhere within south africa and neighboring countries 
under these licenses  nedbank would pay us a license fee  with us supplying smart cards or being paid a royalty if the cards are obtained from a third party 
if nedbank licenses our works to others or otherwise commercially exploits our technology and know how related to ueps  our future revenues may be reduced 
our current license agreement with visa imposes long term restrictions on our ability to license rights in our technology and could inhibit our ability to realize additional revenue from these rights in our technology 
in  we entered into a technology license agreement with visa 
under that agreement  visa purchased a non exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to our technology rights  as defined in the agreement  relating to our ueps technology and an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license under our patents  as defined in the agreement  licensed to visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry  as defined in the agreement 
our visa agreement grants back to us the non exclusive right under our visa licensed patents to make  use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as discussed in the agreement 
in our visa agreement  visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us 
the agreement permits visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its members  any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to visa or its sublicensees 
the agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights  not just our licensed patents  to any of visa s competitors  including mastercard  europay  american express company  discover financial services  diners club international credit card co  carte blanche card or jcb international credit card co 
or any of their parents  subsidiaries or affiliates 
we may need visa s consent  not to be unreasonably withheld  in order to transfer or assign our rights and obligations under the agreement 
as this agreement does not contain a termination date and contains restrictions on our ability to license our technology rights in the financial services industry and to competitors of visa  we may not be able to realize the full value of our technology rights 
our license agreement with visa substantially impacts our ability to defend and enforce our patents licensed to visa and could substantially inhibit our ability to protect the rights in our technology 
under our license agreement with visa  we are restricted from suing visa  its members and any third party vendors or customers of visa or its members for infringement of our technology rights licensed to visa in connection with their manufacture  use or sale of any product or service offered by visa 
the license also grants visa sole discretion with regard to enforcement of any of the licensed technology rights against third parties in the financial services industry 
under the agreement  visa has the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and related patent applications we have licensed to visa in all jurisdictions  and we are obligated to cooperate and support any of visa s actions in this regard 
this arrangement could substantially impact our ability to defend these patents  and could make enforcement actions against our competitors more difficult 
we depend upon third party suppliers  making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations  which could harm our business 
we obtain our smart cards  pos devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers  and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves 
we generally do not have long term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers 
if our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them  or if they increase their prices  we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage 
this could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline 
even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner  our costs could increase 
a supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus  to acquire a new source of customers who use our ueps technology 
any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology  or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
escalating pricing pressures from our retail customers may adversely affect our business 
we have experienced pressure from our retail merchant customers seeking to negotiate the fees we charge them 
this pricing pressure could cause us to reduce the level of the fees we charge to these customers  which could adversely impact our revenues and profit margins 
system failures  including breaches in the security of our system  could harm our business 
we may experience system failures from time to time  and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back end system computer  could harm our revenues and profits  and could subject us to the scrutiny of our government customers 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to avoid our technology altogether  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
these interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff  which  in turn  could delay our introduction of new applications and services 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks and similar events 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
protection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions 
we incorporate security features  including encryption software  biometric identification and secure hardware  into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data 
our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms  the operating system and applications or the hardware platform 
security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions 
if the security of our solutions is compromised  our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected  which would cause our business to suffer  and we may become subject to damage claims 
we have not yet experienced any security breaches affecting our business 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
we may not be able to exploit technological advances quickly and successfully  which could impair our competitive position and operations 
most of our operations depend on the use of advanced technological methods  which must keep pace with rapid technological changes  new product introductions by competitors  evolving industry and government performance and security standards and changes in customer and end user requirements 
the use of the appropriate advanced technological procedures can affect  among other things  the competitiveness of our products  the safety of transactions performed using our products  the continuity of our operations and the capacity and efficiency of our production 
we believe that new technologies may emerge and that existing technologies may be further developed in the fields in which we operate 
unexpected rapid changes in employed technologies that affect our operations and product range could render the technologies we use obsolete or less competitive in the future 
difficulties in accessing new technologies may impede us from implementing them and competitive pressures may force us to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  limited access to sources of new capital to acquire new technologies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business or on our ability to provide competitive products 
our ability to meet the competition will depend on our timely and cost effective implementation of new technological advances 
it will also depend on our success in commercializing these advances in spite of competition we face by patents registered by our competitors 
if we are unable to implement new technologies in a timely or cost efficient basis or penetrate new markets in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash to recipients of social welfare grants 
many social welfare recipients use our services to access cash using their smart cards 
we use armored vehicles to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across south africa to enable these welfare recipients to receive this cash 
in some cases  we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas 
we cannot insure against the risk of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles as we have not identified any insurance underwriters willing to accept this risk 
therefore  we will bear the full cost of any loss or theft in connection with the delivery process  and such loss could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
during the years ended june   and  we incurred losses in connection with our cash delivery system of million  million and million  respectively 
we may not recover outstanding amounts owed to our micro finance businesses 
we operate a traditional micro finance business  with approximately branches throughout south africa 
these branches extend short term loans for periods ranging from days to four months at loans bearing interest rates of to per month 
despite the fact that we attempt to reduce credit risk by employing credit profiling techniques  the rate of default on loans has been high due to the high credit risk of these borrowers and the difficulty of collecting outstanding repayments 
we may therefore not recover some or all of the principal and interest amounts currently owed by our borrowers  which on june   totaled million 
our inability to recover some or all of these amounts may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we may undertake other acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business 
one of our strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions 
although we do not currently have any commitments  contracts or understandings to acquire any specific businesses or other material operations  we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and will consider other acquisitions in the future 
we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or to finance acquisitions on terms that are satisfactory to us 
if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition  finance the acquisition or  if the acquisition occurs  integrate the acquired business into our existing business 
acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require debt financing or additional equity financing  resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership 
integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management away from day to day operations 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
we also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates 
in addition  we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  which could reduce our future reported earnings 
at times  acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition 
we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the prism acquisition we anticipate several benefits from the prism acquisition  including enhancing our geographical penetration in south africa via prism s terminals located in semi urban stores  and thereby strengthen our merchant acquiring footprint  expand our product lines to include services such as prism s prepaid water  electric and mobile phone business  take advantage of prism s smart card manufacturing capabilities  increase the total number of transactions we process and are capable of processing  augment and bolster our management team  technical staff and development professionals  amplify our technological advantage by providing us with access to prism s sim card patented cell phone technology  and expand our market reach into new geographical areas such as the philippines  indonesia and malaysia through prism s existing operations 
there can be no assurance that any of these or other anticipated benefits will materialize and we can t give any indication of the time frame we will require to achieve any of these benefits 
the acquisition  development  adoption  exploitation and distribution of new and existing technology may take long periods of time and may require significant capital investments 
prism has a concentrated customer base  especially for its terminal base and card sales  and the loss of any significant customer may expose us to material financial  credit or performance risks and impair our ability to realize any benefits from prism s customer base 
prism s card manufacturing business  which constitutes of the pro forma operating profit of the company  is exposed to significant competitive risk from low cost high volume producers in other regions 
prism currently provides gsm cards to local south african and international customers 
prism may not be able to compete successfully with these low cost high volume producers and may lose the revenues and profits generated by this business 
prism relies on third party platforms that we do not own or control and are subject to constraints within a number of our core regions 
if these facilities fail to provide us with adequate capacity  we may be restricted in our ability to deliver key services to our customers and we may either incur additional costs or forego revenues 
conversely  improvements to certain third party systems could also reduce revenue 
prism s services and technologies may not achieve widespread commercial success or its products or services may not appeal to enough customers  may not be available at competitive prices  may not function as expected or may not be delivered in a timely fashion easypay is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under  or any future inability to comply with  existing or future regulations or requirements prism s business is subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non complying facility  the imposition of liens  fines and or civil or criminal liability 
since we have only recently completed the prism acquisition and have not yet filed audited financial statements of prism or financial information showing the pro forma effect of the acquisition on our historical financial statements  you may not be able to evaluate the financial impact of the acquisition on us under applicable sec rules  we will be required to file no later than september   an amendment to the form k that we filed reporting the acquisition  which amendment must include audited financial statements of prism and financial information showing the pro forma effect of the acquisition on our historical results of operations as if the transaction had been completed on july   the beginning of our last fiscal year and on our financial condition as if the transaction had been completed on june  while we are currently in the process of preparing the required financial statements and pro forma financial information and expect to timely file the form k a  until we actually file the form k a  you will not be in a position to evaluate prism s historical financial position  results of operations or cash flows or to evaluate the pro forma impact of the acquisition on our historical financial position or results of operations 
we may be subject to privacy laws in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
our collection  storage and processing  and any disclosure of  customer and employee personal information must comply with south africa s privacy laws  which are at various stages of legislative and judicial development 
however  south african common law and the south african constitution do recognize an individual s right to privacy  and there are some statutes and other regulations which have been enacted that apply to us and the way we operate our business 
for example  one statute sets out a framework for the electronic collection  processing  storage and disclosure of personal information 
although compliance with this statute is voluntary  a south african court could determine that we would be violating an individual s right to privacy if we do not operate in compliance with this framework 
in addition  south african law requires that we must keep confidential the hiv status of the people that participate in our hiv aids program 
new privacy laws may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the way we do business  and we could be required to devote substantial management time and resources to comply with these new laws 
in addition  if we violate  or are judged to have violated  the privacy rights of people whose information we collect  store and process  we could become liable for damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations 
we need to comply with a number of international regulations in countries outside of the united states 
in addition  we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties and or restrictions in our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the us department of the treasury s office of foreign asset control  or ofac  administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals based on us foreign policy and national security goals 
as a result  we are restricted from entering into transactions with certain targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals except as permitted by ofac which may reduce our future growth 
we may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we may require additional financing to fund future operations  including expansion in current and new markets  programming development and acquisition  capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies 
because of the early stage of development of our operations and exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us 
we may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations  performances  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
for these reasons  our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control 
if our business development plans are successful  additional financing may be required to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies and to expand into new markets 
the exploitation of our technologies may  therefore  be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we expect our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
as a consequence  our operating results in any single quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
factors that may affect our operating results include demand for and acceptance of our new product offerings  delays in the implementation and delivery of our products and services  which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenue  variations in product mix and cost during any period  development of new relationships and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic partners  difficulties with component supplies  manufacturing or distribution  deferral of customer contracts in anticipation of product or service enhancements  timing of commencement  implementation or completion of major implementation projects  the relative mix of net revenues from established markets  including south africa  and unestablished markets  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the fixed nature of many of our expenses  and industry and economic conditions  including competitive pressures and inventory obsolescence 
in particular  differences in relative growth rates between our businesses in our established markets for certain products and unestablished markets may have a significant effect on our operating results  particularly our reported operating profit percentage  in any individual quarter  with unestablished market sales typically carrying lower margins in the initial phases of our operations in a new area or the introduction of a new product to an area in which we already operate 
certain transactions are difficult to predict and may have a significant effect on our operating results 
sales of this nature include hardware sales to customers and to our smartswitch investments and cause fluctuations in revenue and operating income when they occur 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our products or services to that customer tends to be long and may be subject to delays which may have an impact on our revenues 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long and subject to delays associated with the budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that frequently accompany significant capital expenditures 
a lengthy sales cycle may have an impact on the timing of our revenues  which may cause our quarterly operating results to fall below investor expectations 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services is often discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources  and is influenced by customer budgetary cycles 
to sell our products and services successfully we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services  which can require the expenditure of significant time and resources  however  there can be no assurance that this significant expenditure of time and resources will result in actual sales of our products and services 
we may become subject to a us tax liability for failing to withhold on certain distributions on instruments issued in connection with the aplitec transaction 
there is no statutory  judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the tax treatment of non us holders that elected to receive units in a trust representing beneficial interests in b class preference shares and b class loan accounts issued by new aplitec pursuant to the reinvestment option in connection with our acquisition of aplitec 
we believe these interests should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as  and we did treat them as  separate and distinct interests in new aplitec 
as such  we and our affiliates do not presently intend to withhold any amounts for us federal taxes in respect of any distributions paid on such interests 
there is a risk  however  that these interests  together with the special convertible preferred stock  may be treated as representing a single direct equity interest in us for us federal income tax purposes 
in such case  distributions received with respect to the b class preference shares and b class loan accounts could be subject to us federal withholding tax  and we could be liable for failure to withhold such taxes in our capacity as withholding agent 
in addition  our failure to collect and remit us federal withholding tax may also subject us to penalties 
shipments of our electronic payment systems may be delayed by factors outside of our control  which can harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers 
the shipment of payment systems requires us or our manufacturers  distributors or other agents to obtain customs or other government certifications and approvals and  on occasion  to submit to physical inspection of our systems in transit 
failure to satisfy these requirements  and the very process of trying to satisfy them  can lead to lengthy delays in the delivery of our solutions to our direct or indirect customers 
delays and unreliable delivery by us may harm our reputation in the industry and our relationships with our customers 
force majeure events  such as terrorist attacks  other acts of violence or war  political instability and health epidemics may adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks  war and international political instability  along with health epidemics  may disrupt our ability to generate revenues 
these events may negatively affect our ability to maintain sales revenue and to develop new business relationships 
because a substantial and growing part of our revenues is derived from sales and services to customers outside of the united states and we have our electronic payment systems manufactured outside the united states  terrorist attacks  war and international political instability anywhere may decrease international demand for our products and inhibit customer development opportunities abroad  disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to deliver our electronic payment systems  which could materially adversely affect our net revenues or results of operations 
any of these events may also disrupt global financial markets and precipitate a decline in the price of our common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties our corporate headquarters facility consists of approximately  square feet in johannesburg  south africa 
we also lease properties throughout south africa  including a  square foot manufacturing facility in lazer park and depot facilities 
as a result of our recent acquisition of prism  we now also lease additional office space in johannesburg  cape town and durban  south africa and kuala lumpur  malaysia and a manufacturing facility in springs  south africa 
these leases expire at various dates through the year and  respectively 
we believe we have adequate facilities for our current business operations 
item legal proceedings on july   the south african high court set aside the service level agreement between cash paymaster services northern proprietary limited  or cps n  and the department of health and welfare of the province  or the department 
the court s ruling followed an application by empilweni payout services lp pty limited  or empilweni  a disqualified bidder for the current contract  asking the court  among other things  to set aside the action of the limpopo province tender board  or the tender board  that awarded the contract to cps n 
empilweni s application alleged that the tender board acted improperly in awarding the tender to cps n 
empilweni did not seek relief against cps n or allege wrongdoing by cps n 
empilweni s application was opposed by the tender board  the department  the premier of the province and cps n 
the court s ruling was suspended as a result of filing leave to appeal on july  by the province  the premier of the province and the tender board 
as a result  the contract was reinstated pending the outcome of the appeal 
the court directed the tender board  the department and cps n each to pay a portion of empilweni s costs of the action  which were not be material to us 
this order was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal 
although the court set aside the contract  the court did not grant empilweni s request to direct the tender board to readvertise the tender or to readjudicate the tender  and in effect left it to the discretion of the tender board as to whether it wishes to invite new tenders 
the province has emergency powers to award a contract without commencing a formal tender process 
in april  we signed a new contract with the limpopo provincial government for the distribution of social welfare grants until december  the terms and conditions of the new contract are substantially the same as the contract awarded in november and executed in march there have been reports in the south african press  first reported in and more recently in articles relating to the setting aside of the limpopo contract  that the directorate of special investigations  a south african government agency  has been investigating allegations that northern corporate investment holdings  a former shareholder in cps n  made payments to a trust through which the african national congress in the province and a former premier of the province may have benefited 
we have fully cooperated with the investigating authorities by providing requested documentation and have received confirmation that we are not in any way implicated in the investigation 
there are no material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject
