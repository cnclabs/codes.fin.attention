item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the attached consolidated financial statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below due to a number of factors  including the factors identified under risk factors in item a or elsewhere in this report  and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the sec 
overview we are a leader in the design and manufacture of customer specific integrated analog mixed signal semiconductor products 
we focus on the automotive  medical and industrial markets  which have many products with significant real world  or analog  interface requirements 
we have organized our business into two operating segments integrated mixed signal products  and structured digital products 
during  our mixed signal foundry services segment was combined with our integrated mixed signal products segment 
integrated mixed signal products combine analog and digital functions on a single chip to form a customer defined system level solution 
we also provide outsourced mixed signal foundry services for other semiconductor designers and manufacturers 
structured digital products  which involve the conversion of higher cost programmable digital logic integrated circuits into lower cost digital custom integrated circuits  provide us with growth opportunities and digital design expertise that we use to support the design of system solutions for customers in our target markets 
when evaluating our business  we generally look at financial measures  such as revenue  gross margins and operating margins 
when reviewing operating margins  we exclude restructuring charges  amortization of acquisition related intangibles and other unusual charges 
we also use internal tracking measures  such as projected three year revenue from design wins  to gauge the future health of our business and the capacity utilization of our fabrication facilities 
our projected three year revenue from design wins increased by in when compared with we are seeing continued softness in our capacity utilization 
capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of was 
this is a measure of the degree to which our manufacturing assets are being used  thus sharing the fixed costs of these items across multiple products 
our gross margins could continue to be negatively affected by this in the future 
other key metrics we use to analyze our business include days sale outstanding dso and days of inventory 
based on annualized fourth quarter revenues of million  which includes a full quarter of revenues from the flextronics acquisition  dso increased from days in to days in due to a larger than normal amount of billings in the last month of the year  the granting of some contractually extended payment terms and late customer payments throughout based on annualized fourth quarter cost of revenue  which includes a full quarter of cost of revenue from the flextronics acquisition  and excluding customer funded development cost of revenue  days of inventory increased to days in from days in this was due primarily to additional inventory built in preparation for the relocation of our manila test facility 
in june  we acquired the mixed signal business of alcatel microelectronics nv from stmicroelectronics nv 
we refer to this as the msb acquisition 
the msb acquisition increased our analog and mixed signal engineering team  enhanced our relationships with major european customers  provided us with additional high voltage and wireless technologies that enable us to offer new types of custom integrated circuits to our end markets and provided us with two fabs in oudenaarde  belgium 
the results of operations for  and include msb for the entire period 
in november  we acquired dspfactory ltd 
dspfactory  a leader in ultra low power digital signal processing technology for digital hearing aids and other low power applications 
the results of operations for include dspfactory from the date of acquisition 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report 

table of contents in september  we acquired the semiconductor business of flextronics international usa inc  which specializes in custom mixed signal products  imaging sensors and digital application specific integrated circuits including field programmable gate array conversion products 
the results of operations for include flextronics from the date of acquisition 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we have identified revenue recognition  inventories  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes and stock options as areas involving critical accounting policies and the most significant judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition several criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue from our products and revenue relating to engineering design and product development 
we must apply our judgment in determining when revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue from products sold directly to end customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery is fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain situations  we ship products through freight forwarders 
in most cases  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer s carrier  regardless of the terms and conditions of sale 
the only exception is where title does not pass until the product is received by the customer 
in that case  revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer 
estimates of product returns and allowances  based on actual historical experience and our knowledge of potential issues  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are deducted from revenue 
revenue from contracts to perform engineering design and product development are recognized as milestones are achieved  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
costs associated with such contracts are expensed as incurred  except as discussed below with regard to loss accruals recorded 
revenues under contracts acquired as part of the flextronics acquisition are recorded using the completed contract method 
this method is consistently applied to each contract and revenue is recognized accordingly when the item enters production or when the contract is complete 
for contracts that are recognized as milestones are achieved  a typical milestone billing structure is at the start of the project  at the creation of the reticle set and upon delivery of the prototypes 
since up to of revenue is billed and recognized at the start of the design development work and  therefore  could result in the acceleration of revenue recognition  we analyze those billings and the status of in process design development projects at the end of each reporting period in order to determine that the milestone billings approximate percentage of completion on an aggregate basis 
we compare each project s stage with the total level of effort required to complete the project  which we believe is representative of the cost to cost method of determining percentage of completion 
based on this analysis  the relatively short term nature of our design development process and the billing and recognition of of the project revenue after design development work is complete which effectively defers of 
table of contents the revenue recognition to the end of the contract  we believe our milestone method approximates the percentage of completion method in all material respects 
our engineering design and product development contracts generally involve pre determined amounts of revenue 
we review each contract that is still in process at the end of each reporting period and estimate the cost of each activity yet to be performed under that contract 
this cost determination involves our judgment and the uncertainties inherent in the design and development of integrated circuits 
if we determine that our costs associated with a particular development contract exceed the revenue associated with such contract  we estimate the amount of the loss and establish a corresponding reserve 
inventories we generally initiate production of a majority of our semiconductors once we have received an order from a customer 
based on forecasted demand from specific customers  we may build up inventories of finished goods in anticipation of subsequent purchase orders 
we purchase and maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to meet lead times based on forecasted demand 
if forecasted demand exceeds actual demand  we may need to provide an allowance for excess or obsolete quantities 
we provide an allowance for inventories that are in excess of forecasted demand 
forecasted demand is determined based on multiple factors including historical sales or inventory usage  expected future sales  other projections or the nature of the inventories 
we also review other inventories for indicators of impairment and provide an allowance as deemed necessary 
we also provide an allowance for obsolete inventory  which is written off at the time of disposal 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
the company determines the cost of inventory by adding an amount representative of manufacturing costs plus a burden rate for general manufacturing overhead to the inventory at major steps in the manufacturing process 
property  plant and equipment and intangible assets we regularly evaluate the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current circumstances or events 
the evaluation  which involves significant management judgment  is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related long lived assets  the carrying amount of the underlying assets will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value  primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment are different than originally estimated  the amount of future depreciation expense is modified such that the remaining net book value is depreciated over the revised remaining useful life 
we entered into a non compete agreement with nippon mining and its subsidiary in connection with our december  recapitalization 
according to this agreement  each of nippon mining and its subsidiary agreed to not engage in the custom semiconductor business anywhere in the world through december in our review of the carrying value of intangible assets  we reached a determination that the carrying value of the non compete had been impaired based primarily on a change in nippon mining s and its subsidiary s business focus and related capabilities such that they did not intend to focus on custom semiconductors 
effective june   we released nippon mining and its subsidiary from the non compete agreement and we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the non cash write off of the remaining value of the non compete provision of this agreement 
goodwill under the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment using fair value 
table of contents measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned with the unit s net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no deemed impairment of goodwill and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we annually test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter 
since the adoption of sfas no 
in  our testing has not indicated any impairment 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized  and on the magnitude of any such impairment charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we may obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons of recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to these comparables 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount we determine is more likely than not to be realized based on our analyses of past operating results  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and projected taxable income  including tax strategies available to generate future taxable income 
our analyses of future taxable income are subject to a wide range of variables  many of which involve estimates  and therefore our deferred tax asset may not be ultimately realized 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
stock options through the year ended december   we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we have not recorded any compensation expense for stock options we granted to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
deferred stock based compensation is recorded when stock options are granted to employees at 
table of contents exercise prices less than the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
historically  we generally determined the estimated fair value of our common stock based on independent valuations 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of approximately million in  prior to our initial public offering 
we comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options in determining net income or loss 
in calculating such fair value  there are certain assumptions that we use  as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our options that we issued in included options to purchase shares of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 
under the terms of these options  the exercise prices changed in conjunction with changes in the accreted value of the related preferred stock 
we recorded and adjusted compensation expense each reporting period  as required under apb  for the intrinsic value generated by the change in the exercise price 
during the third quarter of  all options to purchase preferred stock were redeemed  with accrued amounts due being paid in october this redemption resulted in an additional charge to compensation expense of approximately million during the third quarter of during  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options previously awarded to employees and officers that had exercise prices per share of to 
as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares of our stock became exercisable immediately 
we expect this acceleration will reduce the pre tax expense that we would have been required to recognize with respect to stock based compensation under adoption of sfas no

the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature 
our product sales track the general market conditions seen throughout the semiconductor industry 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in decreased to million from million in excluding revenues of million in due to the flextronics acquisition  revenue decreased to million in in we experienced a significant decrease in our communications end market driven by the loss of foundry revenues to stmicroelectronics as a result of the expiration of a take or pay contract in june across our other end markets  but primarily in automotive and industrial  we experienced a greater than normal roll off of revenues from older products in as compared to this was partially offset by increases in medical and defense revenues 
the increase in medical revenues was due in part to a full year of revenues from our dspfactory acquisition in november according to gartner dataquest december  the application specific segment of the semiconductor industry is forecasted to grow by from to for both application specific integrated circuits  and application specific standard products  the market is expected to grow by the same amount   in the flextronics acquisition provided us greater entry into the market for both mixed signal and digital application specific integrated circuits as well as cmos linear image sensors 
the world semiconductor trade statistics wsts  january noted that the market for image sensors grew by in our revenues declined by over this same period  underperforming the forecasted growth of the application specific integrated circuit segment  where the majority of our revenues were derived in integrated mixed signal revenue of million in decreased compared with sales of million 
in  we saw strong growth in the medical end market for this segment  offset by decreases in the communications end market for the reasons noted above 
this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices  due in part to changes in pricing as well as  to changes in the product mix  which was partially offset by an increase in unit volume sold  due to greater product offerings with the addition of revenue from the dspfactory and flextronics acquisitions 
structured digital products revenue was million in  a decrease of over revenue of million 
increased revenue from the defense and industrial end markets were offset by decreases in the communications and computing end markets in this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices  due primarily to changes in the product mix  which was partially offset by an increase in unit volume sold  due to greater product offerings with the addition of revenue from the flextronics acquisition 
we formerly had a third segment  mixed signal foundry services  which we have combined into the integrated mixed signal products segment 
the following table represents our revenue by region for the years ended december north america europe asia gross profit cost of revenue consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
costs related to non recurring engineering fees are included in cost of revenue to the extent that they are reimbursed by our customers under a development arrangement as such reimbursements are recorded as revenue 
costs associated with unfunded non recurring engineering are classified as research and development because we typically retain 
table of contents ownership of the proprietary rights to intellectual property that has been developed in connection with non recurring engineering work 
gross profit decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the decrease in gross profit percentage is a result of decreased utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities  inefficiencies related to the relocation of our test operations in the philippines and the transfer of our sort operations from pocatello and oudenaarde to the philippines  and a million charge related to ongoing discussions involving a previous quality issue with one customer 
operating expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of activities related to process engineering  cost of design tools  investments in development libraries  technology license agreements and product development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this increase is primarily attributable to higher expenses driven by increased design wins and the associated non customer funded expenses  as well as incremental expense from the flextronics acquisition 
marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of commissions to sales representatives  salaries  benefits  and commissions of sales and marketing personnel and advertising and communication costs 
marketing and selling expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this decrease is due to decreased costs associated with lower sales levels as well as the results of cost reduction efforts  including focusing on the use of internal sales people rather than sales rep firms  partially offset by additional costs related to the flextronics acquisition 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our administrative staff  professional fees related to audit and tax services and advisory fees for various consulting projects 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this decrease was primarily due to lower management incentive plan costs in as our financial performance did not meet the minimum requirements to trigger payments under the plan 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets increased to million from million in this increase is due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the dspfactory acquisition as well as a partial year of amortization of the intangible assets associated with the flextronics acquisition 
in process research and development charges were million in related to the flextronics acquisition compared with million in related to the dspfactory acquisition 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in  compared to million in the amounts in are related to several restructuring plans  including the announced consolidation of our fab in belgium and the relocation of our philippines facility combined with the transfer of our wafer sort operations in the united states and belgium to our new facility in the philippines 
the amount in includes charges for employee severance and other items as a result of our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of this program includes headcount reductions related to the consolidation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines  as well as other reductions in force resulting from cost containment measures 
operating income operating income decreased to million in compared with million in  driven by lower revenues  lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses  particularly intangible amortization and research and development costs 
integrated mixed signal products operating income decreased to million  or of segment revenue in from million  or of segment revenue  in this decrease is attributable to 
table of contents lower revenue levels and lower capacity utilization  which drove higher per unit product costs and a reallocation of resources to support this segment s design win activity 
structured digital products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to improved product sales mix and a decrease in operating expense due to a reallocation of resources to support integrated mixed signal design win activity 
net interest expense net interest expense for decreased to million  compared with million in the lower interest expense was primarily attributable to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources  partially offset by a higher balance on our term loan beginning in september due to additional financing obtained in conjunction with the flextronics acquisition 
other expense other expense in increased to million from million in this increase is primarily due to charges associated with the redemption of our senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of income taxes income tax benefit was million in compared with an income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate for was not a meaningful number 
the effective tax rate was in the primary reason for recording a tax benefit on positive net income before taxes in is that there was a loss and a corresponding tax benefit recorded in the us for the year related to our debt refinancing activities in the first quarter  while at the same time there was income and a corresponding tax expense recorded in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates 
while the income in the foreign jurisdictions more than offset the us losses in  the foreign tax expense was not large enough to offset the us tax benefit 
contributing to the large us tax benefit was a reduction in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
based on projections of taxable income for future periods  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowance in we have reduced our deferred tax assets through the use of a valuation allowance to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we will continue to evaluate the need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based upon the anticipated pre tax operating results of future periods 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue in increased to million from million in in  we benefited from strong market conditions during the first half of the year 
during the second half of  we began to see the demand from some of our end markets weakening 
we experienced strong growth in our automotive  medical and industrial end markets  as revenues for in those markets increased in the aggregate over communications was the weakest end market  as revenues increased three percent in over communications revenues were particularly weak in the second half of  due primarily to the expiration of the take or pay arrangement with stmicroelectronics in june incremental revenues from our acquisition of dspfactory in november slightly offset weaker market conditions in the second half of according to gartner dataquest december  the application specific integrated circuit segment of the semiconductor industry grew by from to for both application specific integrated circuits  and application specific standard products  the market grew by in our acquisition of dspfactory provided us greater entry into the market for application specific standard products 
our 
table of contents revenues grew by over this same period  in line with the growth of the application specific integrated circuit segment  where the majority of our revenues were derived in integrated mixed signal sales of million increased over sales of million 
in  we saw steady growth across all end markets for this segment offset by decreased mixed signal foundry sales to stmicroelectronics as a result of the expiration of the take or pay arrangement in june excluding mixed signal foundry sales  which distort price volume relationships  this segment saw both an increase in average selling prices  due to product mix improvements  and an increase in unit volume sold  due to strong market conditions  particularly during the first half of structured digital products revenue was million  an increase of over sales of million 
increased revenue from the computing  industrial and communications end markets  as well as revenue from our xpressarray tm products  helped to increase structured digital products sales in in the fourth quarter of we saw significant weakness in the communications end market for this segment 
for the full year  this segment saw a decrease in average selling prices due to changes in product mix  but an increase in unit volume sold  due to strong market conditions  particularly during the first half of the following table represents our regional revenue for the years ended december north america europe asia gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the increase in gross profit percentage is a result of our continued cost reduction efforts  increased utilization of our fabrication facilities  particularly in the first half of  and an increased percentage of higher margin products in the mix of the products we sold 
during  mixed signal foundry revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to from in this helped to increase our overall gross margin as margins in our mixed signal foundry segment are generally lower than the company average 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in this increase is primarily attributable to expenses related to increased design wins and the associated non customer funded expenses  as well as incremental expense from the dspfactory acquisition 
marketing and selling expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase is due to increased costs associated with higher sales levels 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in this increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees associated with various consulting projects  including sarbanes oxley compliance 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets decreased to million in compared with million in this decrease is primarily due to amortization of an acquisition related intangible asset in  but not in  due to the impairment of the intangible asset in june this decrease was partially offset by increased amortization expense in related to amortization of intangible assets associated with the dspfactory acquisition 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for in process research and development related to the dspfactory acquisition 
no comparable amounts were recorded in we recorded million in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in this amount includes charges for employee severance and other items as a result of our restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of this program includes headcount reductions related to the consolidation of our sort operations in the united states and belgium to the philippines as well as other reductions in force resulting from cost containment measures 
we expect to realize million per quarter in cost savings as a result of this action by the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the write off of the unamortized balance of an intangible asset that had no remaining value 
we entered into a non compete agreement with nippon mining and its subsidiary that was our former parent in connection with our december  recapitalization pursuant to which they agreed to not engage in the custom semiconductor business anywhere in the world through december in our second quarter review of the carrying value of intangible assets in  we reached a determination that the carrying value of the non compete had been impaired based primarily on a change in nippon mining s and our former parent s business focus and related capabilities such that they did not intend to focus on custom semiconductors 
effective june   we released nippon mining and our former parent from the non compete agreement and we expensed the million remaining unamortized balance of the agreement as of the effective date 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
this amount was primarily related to employee severance as a result of employee terminations and the termination of services with certain sales representative firms 
in september  we recorded nonrecurring charges of million 
this amount includes a one time payment of million associated with amendments to our advisory agreements as well as compensation expense of million related to the redemption of options to purchase our series a and series b preferred stock 
the advisory agreements were in place prior to our initial public offering and provided for citigroup venture capital cvc and francisco partners to provide financial  advisory and consulting services to us 
in conjunction with our ipo  we terminated the advisory agreement and the associated future scheduled annual fees 
these charges did not recur in operating income operating income increased to million in compared with million in  driven by increases in operating income across all of our segments and lower restructuring and nonrecurring charges in as compared with integrated mixed signal products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue  in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to increased revenue levels and improved capacity utilization  which drove lower per unit product costs  particularly in the first half of  as well as the decrease of low margin revenue associated with the stmicroelectronics take or pay agreement that had been in place for all of  but only the first half of structured digital products operating income increased to million  or of segment revenue  in from million  or of segment revenue  in this increase is attributable to improved product sales mix and improved factory utilization  which drove lower per unit product costs  particularly in the first half of net interest expense net interest expense for decreased to million  compared with million in the lower interest expense was primarily attributable to the decreased debt balance of our senior subordinated

we have a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
based on the operating results of  we reversed approximately million of valuation allowance during we will continue to evaluate the need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based upon the anticipated pre tax operating results of future periods 
our effective tax rate was in the effective tax rate was unusually high as a percentage of our pre tax loss due to jurisdictional profit and loss mix 
jurisdictions with losses where tax benefits were recorded were those that generally had higher statutory tax rates  whereas jurisdictions with income where tax expense was recorded were those that generally had lower statutory tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to fund working capital needs  meet required debt payments  including debt service payments on our senior credit facilities  complete planned maintenance of equipment and equip our fabrication facilities 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet working capital needs  interest payment requirements on our debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
although we believe these resources may also meet our liquidity needs beyond that period  the adequacy of these resources will depend on our growth  semiconductor industry conditions and the capital expenditures necessary to support capacity and technology improvements 
on september   we amended our senior secured credit facilities by borrowing an additional million under the term loan to fund a portion of the flextronics acquisition 
the amended senior credit facilities consist of the amended senior secured term loan and a million revolving credit facility  of which million was allocated to a letter of credit as of december  pursuant to the senior credit facility  the covenants require of the domestic corporations equity and of the directly owned foreign corporations equity be collateralized 
the term loan requires principal payments of million  together with accrued interest  on the last day of march  june  september and december of each year  with the balance due on april  the interest rate on the senior secured term loan on december  was  based on libor the revolving credit facility million of which may be in the form of letters of credit is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in addition  we recorded million in deferred financing costs related to the amended senior credit facility  included in other long term assets in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet  which will be amortized over the term of the senior credit facilities 
the facilities require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and contain certain other nonfinancial covenants  all as defined within the credit agreement 
the facilities also generally restrict payment of dividends to parties outside of the consolidated entity 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we anticipate continuing to be in compliance with these covenants in the first quarter of 
table of contents on march   we announced a tender offer for our senior subordinated notes as well as a refinancing of the then existing million senior secured term loan and million revolving credit facility 
on april   of the outstanding notes had been repurchased and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes was discharged 
proceeds from a new senior secured term loan of million  entered into on april   and existing cash of million were used to purchase the outstanding notes for million  pay a premium on the notes and expenses associated with the tender of million in the aggregate  which is recorded in other expense on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations  repay the outstanding balance of the previous senior secured term loan of million  with the remainder used to pay accrued interest on the notes and the previous senior secured term loan  and pay expenses related to the refinancing of our senior credit facilities 
as a result of these transactions  total debt was reduced by million 
in conjunction with the refinancing  we recorded a charge of million in other expense on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of for the write off of deferred financing and other costs associated with the notes and the previous senior credit facilities 
in addition  we recorded million in deferred financing costs related to the new senior credit facility  included in other long term assets in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet  which will be amortized over the term of the senior credit facilities 
we generated million in cash from operating activities in  compared to million in cash from operating activities in this decrease was primarily due to costs associated with the tender offer and redemption of our senior subordinated notes during the first quarter of and increases in working capital 
other significant sources and uses of cash can be divided into investing activities and financing activities 
during and  we invested in capital equipment in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
see capital expenditures below 
during we also paid cash of million for the flextronics acquisition  of which was financed by increased bank debt 
during  we generated net cash from financing activities of million due primarily to the addition of million to our term loan in the third quarter of to finance the flextronics acquisition  partially offset by lowering our long term debt by million in conjunction with the tender offer and redemption of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our senior credit facilities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
these risks primarily relate to the sale of products and services to foreign customers and changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in belgium as well as other foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure  primarily related to euro denominated exposure  is due to potential fluctuations in our annual sales and operating costs denominated in foreign currencies as well as exposure arising from the translation or remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in euros and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in euro currency exchange rates 
we have attempted to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
during december  we entered into a foreign exchange collar contract  which ensures conversion of million at a rate of no less than and no more than per additionally  we have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation or remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed to fluctuations include the euro  the japanese yen and the philippine peso 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
as of december   approximately of our consolidated net assets were attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in foreign currencies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december  would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million  primarily due to euro denominated exposures 
we have attempted to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
on december   we entered into a foreign currency contract to sell million on april  at a rate of per this contract acts as a hedging instrument to limit the variability of the euro cash balance  as valued in dollars  held by our european subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in item of this annual report 
we enter into forward contracts throughout the quarter as necessary using contracts that have maturities that do not exceed days 
all derivative contracts we entered into are components of our hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
the fair value of our forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by against the foreign currencies that are hedged by our forward exchange contracts  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million at december  however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying net assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
as of december   our analysis indicated that 
table of contents such market movements  given the offsetting foreign currency gains or losses on the underlying cash balances  would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the our ability to accurately project sales  expenses and cash balances 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the our analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustable margin under our credit agreement 
a change of in the interest rate would cause a change of approximately million in interest expense 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on our current cash and cash equivalent balances 
for example  if the interest rate on our interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or our potential response to such hypothetical conditions 
cash and cash equivalents include all marketable securities purchased with maturities of three or fewer months 
cash equivalents at december  and  consisted primarily of investments in money market funds and us agencies
