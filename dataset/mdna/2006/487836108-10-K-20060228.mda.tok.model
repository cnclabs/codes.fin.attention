kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations based on the geographic regions of north america  europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
this organizational structure is the basis of the operating segment data presented in this report 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets of low single digit for internal net sales  mid single digit for internal operating profit  and high single digit for net earnings per share 
our measure of internal growth excludes the impact of currency and  if applicable  acquisitions  dispositions  and shipping day differences 
in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe this profitable growth will provide strong total return to our shareholders 
we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business  expanding our snacks business  and pursuing selected growth opportunities 
we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize sales dollars over shipment volume volume to value  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital manage for cash 
we believe the success of our strategy and operating principles are reflected in our steady growth in earnings and strong cash flow over the past several years 
this performance has been achieved despite significant challenges such as rising commodity  fuel  energy  and employee benefit costs  as well as increased investment in brand building  innovation  and cost reduction initiatives

during the year  successful innovation and brand building investment continued to drive strong growth across our north american business units  which collectively reported a increase in net sales versus internal net sales of our north america retail cereal business increased  with strong performance in both the united states and canada 
as a result  our dollar share of the us ready to eat cereal category increased basis points during  to as of january   representing the sixth consecutive year of share growth 
internal net sales of our north america retail snacks business consisting of wholesome snacks  cookies  crackers  and toaster pastries increased on top of growth in this growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks  toaster pastries  cracker products  and major cookie brands 
partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations 
internal net sales of our north america frozen and specialty channel which includes food service  vending  convenience  drug stores  and custom manufacturing businesses collectively increased approximately  led by solid contributions from our eggo frozen foods and food service businesses 
net sales in our european operating segment were approximately even with  with internal net sales growth at nearly 
this growth was largely due to cereal and snacks sales across southern europe  partially offset by a sales decline in our nordics market  which resulted from a temporary delisting by a major customer 
despite intense competitive pressures on our uk business unit  we were able to maintain sales within this market at nearly the prior year level 
strong performance in latin america resulted in net sales growth of nearly  with internal sales growth at 
most of this growth was due to strong performance by our mexico  venezuela  and caribbean business units  although sales increased in virtually all the latin american markets in which we do business 
net sales in our asia pacific operating segment increased approximately  with internal net sales growth at 
this sales increase was largely due to innovation related growth in our asian markets  partially offset by a decline in our australian business  which was unfavorably impacted by competitive nutritional claims and timing of snack product innovation versus the prior year 
in late  we introduced new products and undertook health oriented initiatives which we believe will mitigate these in market factors during consolidated operating profit increased during  with our european operating segment contributing approximately one half of the total dollar increase 
this disproportionate contribution was attributable to a year over year shift in segment allocation of charges from cost reduction initiatives 
as discussed in the section beginning on page  the year over year change in project cost allocation was a million decline in europe improving segment operating profit performance by approximately and a million increase in north america reducing segment operating profit performance by approximately

strong performance in latin america resulted in net sales growth of approximately  with internal net sales growth of more than offsetting unfavorable foreign currency movements 
most of this growth was due to very strong price mix and tonnage improvements in both cereal and snack sales by our mexican business unit 
net sales in our asia pacific operating segment increased approximately due primarily to favorable foreign currency movements  with internal net sales growth at

gross margin sga a operating margin a selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
our long term goal is to achieve annual improvements in gross margin and to reinvest this growth in brand building and innovation expenditures  so as to maintain a relatively steady operating margin 
our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through sales driven operating leverage  mix improvements  productivity savings  and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 
in  our consolidated gross margin increased by basis points to 
for  we were able to maintain our consolidated gross margin at this level  overcoming the impact of several significant cost factors as discussed in the following paragraphs 
supported by late price increases in various markets and pay back from prior investment  we expect to moderately expand our gross margin again in in  we experienced an uncontrollable  weather related hike in fuel and energy costs during the second half of the year  while in  our 
table of contents commodity costs rose significantly and remained historically high throughout in summary  we believe market price inflation negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin by approximately basis points in and a net basis points in basis points from fuel energy partially offset by an easing in certain commodity prices 
our profitability projections for currently include a basis point unfavorable gross margin impact from fuel  energy  and other commodity price inflation 
employee benefit costs the majority of which is recorded in cost of goods sold also increased for both and  with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching nearly million in versus approximately million in and million in our profitability projections for currently include incremental employee benefits expense of million 
in addition to external cost pressures  our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives refer to following section has placed short term pressure on our gross margin performance during the periods presented 
the portion of total program related charges recorded in cost of goods sold was in millions   additionally  cost of goods sold for includes a charge of approximately million  related to a lump sum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the four year period ended october cost reduction initiatives we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our sustainable growth model of earnings reinvestment for reliability in meeting long term growth targets 
initiatives undertaken must meet certain pay back and internal rate of return irr targets 
we currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion or to achieve an irr of at least 
each cost reduction initiative is of relatively short duration normally one year or less  and begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation during the first year of implementation  which is then used to fund new initiatives 
to implement these programs  the company has incurred various up front costs  including asset write offs  exit charges  and other project expenditures  which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the net sales and operating profit section beginning on page in  we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity  resulting in the closure of two facilities by mid major initiatives commenced in were the global rollout of the sap information technology system  reorganization of pan european operations  consolidation of us meat alternatives manufacturing operations  and relocation of our us snacks business unit to battle creek  michigan 
major actions implemented in included a wholesome snack plant consolidation in australia  manufacturing capacity rationalization in the mercosur region of latin america  and a plant workforce reduction in great britain 
additionally  during all periods presented  we have undertaken various manufacturing capacity rationalization and efficiency initiatives primarily in our north american and european operating segments  as well as the disposal of a manufacturing facility in china 
details of each initiative are described in note to consolidated financial statements 
related to the aforementioned us snacks bakery consolidation  we expect to incur approximately million of project costs in  two thirds comprised of cash costs and one third asset write offs 
other potential initiatives to be commenced in are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as management commits to these discretionary investments 
our earnings target includes projected charges related to potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately million or

the charges impacted our operating segments as follows in millions north america  europe  latin america  asia pacific exit cost reserves were approximately million at december   consisting principally of severance obligations associated with projects commenced in  which are expected to be paid out in at january   exit cost reserves were approximately million  representing severance costs that were substantially paid out in interest expense between the acquisition of keebler foods company in early and the end of  our company paid down nearly billion of debt  even early retiring long term debt in each of the past three years 
net early retirement premiums are recorded in interest expense and were in millions   these premiums were or are expected to be largely recovered through lower short term interest rates over the original remaining terms of the retired debt 
as a result of this debt reduction  interest expense declined significantly from to  but leveled off in as we reached a near term steady state debt position by year end  which is discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section on page nevertheless  based on prevailing interest rates  we currently expect interest expense to decline from the amount  due primarily to a shift in our total debt mix from higher rate long term to lower rate short term

income taxes the consolidated effective income tax rate for was approximately  which was below both the rate of nearly and the rate of less than 
as compared to the prior period rates  the consolidated effective income tax rate benefited primarily from the reorganization of our european operations and to a lesser extent  from us tax legislation that allows a phased in deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income qpi  beginning in the resulting tax savings have been reinvested  in part  in cost reduction initiatives  brand building expenditures  and other growth initiatives 
we currently expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be  however  this projection could be significantly affected by the implementation of tax savings initiatives currently in the planning stages  the settlement of several on going domestic and international income tax audits  or other similar discrete events within interim periods of we expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities 
during  we elected to repatriate approximately billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which qualified for the temporary dividends received deduction available under the american jobs creation act 
the associated net tax cost of approximately million was provided for in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows  supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
this cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our cash conversion cycle is relatively short  although receivable collection patterns vary around the world  in the united states  our days sales outstanding dso averages days 
as a result  the growth in our operating cash flow should generally reflect the growth in our net earnings over time 
as presented in the schedule to the right  operating cash flow performance for generally reflects this principle  except for the level of benefit plan contributions and working capital movements operating assets and liabilities 
in addition to these two variables  operating cash flow performance for further deviates from this pattern due principally to the significant portion of net earnings growth for the year attributable to non cash deferred income tax benefits

we did not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the periods presented  nor do we expect to have in the next several years 
total minimum benefit plan contributions for are currently expected to be approximately million 
actual or future year s contributions could exceed our current projections  as influenced by our decision to voluntarily pre fund our obligations versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  or renewals of union contracts 
for  the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to increased trade payables  partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables  which returned to historical levels in relation to sales in early from lower levels at the end of we believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our rd week over the holiday period  which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout core working capital as a percentage of sales has steadily improved over the past several years  representing of net sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to for and for we have achieved this multi year reduction primarily through logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements  faster collection of accounts receivable  and extension of terms on trade payables 
while our long term goal is to continue to improve this metric  we no longer expect movements in the absolute balance of core working capital to represent a significant source of operating cash flow 
the unfavorable movements in other working capital for  as presented in the preceding table  relate largely to higher income tax payments and faster payment of customer promotional incentives  as compared to prior years 

table of contents our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchase 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change our cash flow as defined declined approximately versus the prior year  attributable primarily to incremental benefit plan contributions as discussed on page and increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company s strong sales growth over the past several years 
this increased capital spending represented of net sales  which exceeds our recent historical spending level of approximately of net sales for both and we expect this trend to continue in the near term  with projected property expenditures reaching approximately of net sales 
we currently expect our cash flow for to be million  with the increase over the amount funded principally by a decline in benefit plan contributions  partially offset by a slight increase in capital spending as a percentage of sales 
in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business  we completed two separate business acquisitions during for a total of approximately million in cash  including related transaction costs 
in june  we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago  illinois and employs approximately active hourly and salaried employees 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington state based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 
for  our board of directors had originally authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to million 
in october  our board of directors approved an increase in the authorized amount of stock repurchases to million and an additional million for pursuant to this authorization  in november  we repurchased approximately million common shares from the wk kellogg foundation trust the trust for million in a privately negotiated transaction pursuant to an agreement dated as of november  the agreement 
the agreement provided the trust with registration rights in certain circumstances for additional common shares which the trust might desire to sell and provided the company with rights to repurchase those additional common shares 
in combination with open market transactions completed prior to november  we spent a total of million to repurchase approximately million shares during pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years  we paid million in for approximately million shares and million during for approximately million shares 
in connection with our stock repurchase authorization  we entered into an agreement with the trust dated as of february  the agreement to repurchase approximately million additional shares from the trust for million 
the agreement extinguished the registration and repurchase rights under the agreement upon the company s repurchase of those additional shares on february  in july  we redeemed million of long term debt  representing the remaining principal balance of our us dollar notes due april in october  we repaid million of maturing us dollar notes 
in december  we redeemed million of us dollar notes due june these payments were funded principally through issuance of us dollar short term debt 
during november  subsidiaries of the company issued approximately million of foreign currency denominated debt in offerings outside of the united states  consisting of euro million of floating rate notes due and approximately c million of canadian commercial paper 
these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company  as well as for general corporate purposes 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these debt issuances 
at december   our total debt was approximately billion  approximately even with the balance at year end as discussed in the interest expense section on page  this debt balance represents nearly a billion reduction from a peak level of billion in early during  we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately  reduced the company s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately  and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 
primarily due to the recent 
table of contents prioritization of these uses of cash flow  plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity  we no longer expect to reduce debt at the recent historical pace  but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term 
we currently expect the total debt balance at year end to remain at approximately billion 
we believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities  through our strong cash flow  our program of issuing short term debt  and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis 
our significant long term debt issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit its access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our credit facilities  which are in amounts sufficient to cover the outstanding short term debt balance and debt principal repayments through off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
further information on lease obligations is contained in note contractual obligations payments due by period and millions total beyond long term debt a capital leases operating leases purchase obligations b other long term c total a long term debt obligations include amounts due for both principal and fixed rate interest payments 
b purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent  of service agreements  and contracts for future delivery of commodities  packaging materials  and equipment 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
c other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer pension plans  and other retiree benefits in excess of those provided within our broad based plans 
we do not currently have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our broad based retiree benefit plans during the periods presented and have not included these amounts in the table 
refer to notes and within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these plans  including expected contributions for fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately million and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to million 
we record the fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet  which we currently estimate to be insignificant 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
significant accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
none of the pronouncements adopted during the periods presented have had or are expected to have a significant impact on our company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment  which we adopted as of the beginning of our fiscal year  using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  
table of contents prior years were not restated  but results are being presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation from our fiscal year 
if this standard had been adopted in  net earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately 
and we currently expect a similar impact of adoption for however  the actual impact on will  in part  depend on the particular structure of stock based awards granted during the year and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards 
we classify pre tax stock compensation expense in selling  general  and administrative expense principally within our corporate operations 
sfas no 
revised also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings will be presented in the statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow 
if this standard had been adopted in  operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately million as a result of this provision 
the actual impact on operating cash flow will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during the year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value determined for financial reporting purposes 
our critical accounting estimates  which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements  are discussed in the following sections on pages promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in store displays and events  feature price discounts on our products  consumer coupons  contests  and loyalty programs  and similar activities 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of 

of our company s net sales 
however  as our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly of net sales  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
intangibles we follow sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in evaluating impairment of intangibles 
under this standard  goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction 
similarly  impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process 
at december   intangible assets  net  were billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we follow sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits 
table of contents provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom  and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we work with third party financial consultants to model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the th percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign plan investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan investments 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in year for each of the three years ending december   our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we work with third party financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered employee population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of claims cost over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
the combined net experience loss arising from recognition of all prior years claims experience  together with the revised trend rate assumption  was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities  with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index for our us plans 
to test the appropriateness of these indices  we 
table of contents periodically engage third party financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities  consisting principally of aa rated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions non callable issues with at least million principal outstanding 
the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due 
for those years where no suitable bonds are available  the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years 
as of three different interim dates in  this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within basis points of the equivalent dated citigroup pension liability index 
the measurement dates for our benefit plans are generally consistent with our company s fiscal year end 
thus  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of december   we had consolidated unamortized net experience losses of approximately billion 
of this total  approximately was related to discount rate reductions  was related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate  with the remainder related to asset returns and other demographic factors 
for  we currently expect incremental amortization of experience losses of approximately million 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  tax reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded of earnings before income taxes annually 
future outlook our long term annual growth targets are low single digit for internal net sales  mid single digit for internal operating profit  and high single digit for net earnings per share 
in addition  we remain committed to growing our brand building investment faster than the rate of sales growth 
in general  we expect results to be consistent with our growth targets for net sales and operating profit 
we expect each of our operating segments to deliver low single digit net sales growth in  except for latin america  which we expect to achieve mid single digit growth due to a continuation of the more rapid category expansion in that region 
we expect the reported increase in net earnings per share to be dampened by approximately  due to the adoption of sfas no 
revised  as discussed on pages and we will continue to reinvest in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of the ongoing business operations and management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
the company  as a matter of policy  does not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein under part ii  item  for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  
table of contents intercompany transactions  and nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  the company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational positions and enters into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
management periodically uses interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein under part ii  item  provides information on the company s significant debt issues 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end and assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in price risk the company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
management uses the combination of long cash positions with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a duration of generally less than one year 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases 
in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above  management uses long cash positions with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure 
it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of the company
