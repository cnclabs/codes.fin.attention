results of operations revenue we are focused on maintaining our position as one of the world s leading specialists in servicing collective investment funds  mutual funds and pension plans

we provide fund accounting  custody  investment management  securities finance  transfer agency services  and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers 
these services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide  in any time zone across multiple currencies 
our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active  long term relationships that result in high customer retention  cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue 
the servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive  and we remain focused on winning and retaining customer business 
this focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower unit costs 
our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance  trading services and other processing fee revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from customer deposits and short term investment activities 
we provide deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements state street corporation and commercial paper  to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments  and invest these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate  generating net interest revenue 
fee revenue total fee revenue was billion for compared to billion in  an increase of million 
servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue  and combined comprised of total fee revenue 
servicing fees increased over  and management fees increased  as a result of new business from existing and new customers and higher equity market valuations 
servicing and management fees are a function of several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  as well as the types of products and services used by customers  and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations 
in general  servicing fees are impacted  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody  while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
however  additional factors  such as transaction volumes  balance credits  customer minimum balances and other factors may have a significant impact on this revenue 
management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
however  performance fees have become a larger component of management fee revenue over the last year 
performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds peer or equity market benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
the following table presents selected equity market indices 
daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue  respectively

state street corporation at year end  our total assets under custody were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue 
assets under custody at december consisted of the following assets under custody agr cagr dollars in billions as of december  customers in the us mutual funds pensions  insurance and other investment pools customers outside the us acquired with gss total non us securities as a percentage of total assets relating to gss customers  the majority of which had not yet converted to our systems  at december  for and  assets related to gss customers were included in the other categories of assets

these products are differentiated by our position as an agent and partner of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees were million in  compared to million a year earlier 
growth was attributable to a significant increase in the global transition management business  as well as an increase in equity trading revenue in the us securities finance securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on existing portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity in more than markets around the world 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
for cash collateral  we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue of million in increased million from a year earlier 
securities finance revenue  which is historically affected by seasonality during the second quarter of the year as a result of heavy borrowing demand from customers  is principally a function of the volume of securities lent and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral 
growth in fees in reflected improved interest rate spreads and a increase in securities finance volumes during processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue was million in  down slightly compared with million in processing fees and other revenue includes multiple sources of fees and other revenue  including fees from structured products  fees from software licensing and maintenance  profits and losses from unconsolidated affiliates  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings

net interest revenue was million for  an increase of million compared to million in  which reflected a reduction of million in interest revenue due to a change in the applicable state tax rate for leveraged lease transactions 
excluding this reduction from  net interest revenue would have increased by million during higher interest revenue was principally due to an increase in the size of the average balance sheet and the impact of repositioning and increasing the average size of the investment securities portfolio 
for the year ended december   our investment securities portfolio  on an average basis  included a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and floating rate  asset backed securities compared to a year earlier  and a lower percentage of us treasuries and direct obligations of federal agencies

operating expenses for included million of merger and integration costs  compared with million of merger  integration and divestiture costs in in addition  operating expenses included million of restructuring costs related to a reduction in force  down from million in salaries and employee benefits expense increased million for  driven by higher incentive compensation costs resulting from our improved earnings  somewhat offset by a decrease in expenses for costs related to the pam business prior to its sale 
information systems and communications expense decreased million from the prior year  primarily the result of the benefits of converting gss customers to our systems 
transaction processing services expense increased million from these expenses  which are in large part volume related  include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  subcustodian fees and external contract services 
the increase resulted from a higher level of investment activity combined with higher net asset values that impact subcustodian fees 
occupancy expense increased million from  reflective of our move to our new corporate headquarters  the costs of a new data center  and the recognition of a loss of million from a sub lease agreement

after refilling some of those positions  we were able to reduce our workforce by approximately  positions as a result of this program 
other operating expenses increased million from  primarily due to increases in professional services related to growth initiatives  compliance requirements  such as that related to the sarbanes oxley act  regulatory inquiries and basel ii readiness

per share in significant accounting estimates state street s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  including prevailing practices within the financial services industry 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
the majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the policies  estimates and assumptions underlying certain reported amounts  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as accounting for lease financing  accounting for goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for pension costs 
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining and audit committee of the board 
lease financing we have a leveraged lease portfolio consisting of us and cross border financings  primarily for transportation equipment  including trains  aircraft and ships 
lease financing investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values  net of non recourse debt and unearned state street corporation income 
unearned income is recognized in interest revenue to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases 
measuring the net investment and interest revenue related to lease financing requires the use of several assumptions regarding estimates of residual values  the amount and timing of cash flows  and the impact of income tax regulations and income tax rates relating to the leases 
due to the complexity and long term nature of many of these leases  these assumptions are reviewed regularly for adjustments that may be required  including the recognition of other than temporary impairment of residual values 
changes in these assumptions in future periods could affect asset balances and related interest revenue 
additional information about lease financing balances is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
goodwill goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
the majority of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business 
approximately of the total goodwill included in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line  and the remaining was recorded by investment management 
the sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation  using quoted market prices in active markets  or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data  such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures 
in limited circumstances  these methodologies are not available  and as such  we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that a business of state street will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
our goodwill impairment testing for indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired  except for that related to bel air  which was the result of our plan to dispose of our ownership interest and the resulting business line organizational realignment  and this impairment was recorded in the third quarter of additional information about goodwill is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our overall tax position is fundamentally complex  and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which state street operates 
these tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be state street corporation adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal 
management s determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the realization of deferred tax assets arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods  future taxable income  including foreign source income  and the achievement of tax planning strategies 
underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time  influencing our overall tax positions  as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances 
management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation  decisions  rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets 
additional information about income taxes is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension costs we maintain a tax qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees  as well as certain non us defined benefit plans 
measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of many assumptions  including estimates of future interest rates  asset returns  compensation increases and other actuarial based projections relating to the plans 
pension related estimates have a significant impact on the determination of pension obligations and related expense 
we use december as a measurement date for our pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances 
each year  we review actual demographic and investment experience with the plans actuaries 
in addition to actual experience  adjustments to assumptions consider published interest rate indices  known compensation trends and policies and economic conditions that may affect the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets 
the significant assumptions used to measure periodic benefit cost and pension obligations are described below 
size and characteristics of the employee population periodic benefit cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans and other factors  including salary  age and years of employment 
actuarial assumptions actuarial assumptions used to estimate benefit obligations consider factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors tend to change gradually over time 
the aggregate impact of assumptions is reviewed each year and specific assumptions are reviewed periodically 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets we calculate the expected return on plan assets each year based on the composition of assets at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time and is not expected to change significantly 
as a result  the pattern of income or expense recognition closely matches the stable pattern of services provided by our employees over the life of the pension obligation 
to determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable  we consider such factors as the actual return earned on plan assets  historical rates of return on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  projections of returns on various asset classes  and current prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts 
discount rate we use the discount rate to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations 
it reflects the rates available on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments  reset annually on the measurement date

state street corporation financial condition statement of condition overview 
chartkaveliabvjpg 
the structure of our consolidated statement of condition  or balance sheet  is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
as our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers 
our operating objectives and customers needs determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of short term money market instruments  such as inter bank placements  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements  and high quality  marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment portfolio 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific board approved policies for market risk  credit risk and liquidity 
for  average interest bearing liabilities increased billion from  reflecting an increase in non us deposits of billion  partly offset by a decrease in average us deposits of billion 
much of the growth in foreign deposits came from the conversion of customer liabilities onto our balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of a substantial portion of the gss business of deutsche bank ag in these deposits are generally non us dollar denominated  reflecting the primary nature of the acquired activities 
average interest earning assets for increased billion  or  from  reflecting the additional funds generated by higher levels of customer liabilities 

chartkaveasstvjpg 
during  we made efforts to reposition our balance sheet by investing in more floating rate investment securities and decreasing our investments in interest bearing deposits with banks 
average investment securities increased billion from  primarily mortgage backed us federal agency securities and floating rate asset backed securities  while average interest bearing deposits with banks decreased billion 
this reallocation of assets was undertaken without materially altering our risk profile  as our overall credit risk profile remained appropriately diversified 
state street corporation investment securities we consider a well diversified  high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet 
the portfolio continues to be concentrated in marketable securities with high credit quality  with approximately of the carrying value of the portfolio aaa or aa rated 
as of december  the percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by credit rating were as follows aaa aa a bbb non rated includes us treasury securities the investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class 
the bulk of the portfolio is in high grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan  credit card  auto and student loan securities 
mortgage backed securities are split almost equally between securities of federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation and private label collateralized mortgage obligations 
the carrying values of investment securities as of december were as follows dollars in millions available for sale us treasury and federal agencies direct obligations mortgage backed securities asset backed securities state and political subdivisions collateralized mortgage obligations other debt investments money market mutual funds other equity securities total held to maturity us treasury and federal agencies direct obligations mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations other investments total we had million of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at december   or million after tax 
net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  were million  or million after tax 
we consider the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and primarily the result of rising interest rates over the course of  not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio 
we generally configure our investment securities portfolio so that any change in its fair value is largely  but not totally  offset by changes in the economic value of our customer liabilities  however  existing state street corporation accounting standards do not allow for the change in economic value of our customer liabilities to offset unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
we intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure  which is maintained within approved risk limits  and in consideration of the global interest rate environment 
even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities  we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile  or experience a material impact on net interest revenue 
additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the increase in securities held to maturity resulted from our investment of certain customer liabilities in connection with our repositioning of the balance sheet 
these liabilities are generated from our core investment servicing and investment management businesses  and are fairly stable 
as a result  we were able to invest a portion of these liabilities in securities which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
the maturities of debt investment securities as of december   and the weighted average taxable equivalent yields  were as follows under year to years to years over years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in millions available for sale us treasury and federal agencies direct obligations mortgage backed securities asset backed securities state and political subdivisions collateralized mortgage obligations other investments total held to maturity us treasury and federal agencies direct obligations mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations other investments total yields calculated for interest revenue on non taxable investment securities include the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments  a method of presentation in which interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted to present the earnings performance on a basis equivalent to interest earned on fully taxable securities  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
the adjustment is computed using a federal income tax rate of  adjusted for applicable state income taxes  net of the related federal tax benefit 
the taxable equivalent adjustment included in interest revenue to calculate the yields above was million for the year ended december  the maturities of asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based upon the expected principal payments 
state street corporation loans and lease financing us and us loans and lease financing as of december  and average loans outstanding for the years ended december  were as follows dollars in millions us commercial and financial lease financing total us non us commercial and industrial lease financing banks and other financial institutions other total non us total loans average loans and lease financing outstanding at december   approximately of our assets consisted of loans and lease financing 
as of december  and  unearned revenue included in lease financing was billion and billion for non us leases  and million and million for us leases  respectively 
information about our allowance for loan losses is included in the risk management credit risk section of this discussion and analysis 
maturities for selected loan and lease financing categories as of december   were as follows years total under to over dollars in millions us commercial and financial lease financing total us non us commercial and industrial lease financing total non us total state street corporation the following table shows the classification of loans and leases due after one year according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  dollars in millions loans and leases with predetermined interest rates loans and leases with floating or adjustable interest rates total cross border outstandings cross border outstandings are amounts payable to state street by residents of foreign countries  regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated  and local country claims in excess of local country obligations 
these outstandings primarily consist of deposits with banks 
as of december   and  total cross border outstandings represented  and of our consolidated total assets  respectively 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
we manage our cross border outstandings using approved exposure limits 
cross border outstandings to countries in which we do business which amounted to at least of our consolidated total assets as of december were as follows dollars in millions germany united kingdom canada australia netherlands japan france total outstanding aggregate cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between 
and of our consolidated total assets at december  were billion belgium and japan  at december   billion netherlands  france and sweden  and at december   million netherlands 
capital regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while serving depositors  creditors and regulatory needs 
the capital committee  working in conjunction with the asset and liability committee  or alco  oversees the management of regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of credit rating agencies 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our capital position relative to our peers  regulatory capital state street corporation requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and the bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia 
the bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for state street to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier capital total capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
at december   our tier and total risk based capital ratios  as well as those of the bank  were down from year end growth in capital was outpaced by growth in total risk weighted assets  primarily the result of repositioning and increasing the size of our investment securities portfolio  an increase in loans  and the impact of new banking regulatory guidance related to the risk weighting of liquidity facilities with certain special purpose entities  partly offset by lower interest bearing deposits with banks 
our ratios  and those of the bank  exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
to manage fluctuations in the tier and total risk based capital of state street and state street bank resulting from foreign currency translation  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non us subsidiaries 
the notional value of these contracts was million  or approximately million  at december in june  the basel committee on banking supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework  or basel ii 
in september  the us regulators announced a delay in the issuance of proposed rules and a revised implementation schedule 
the us regulatory agencies are expected to release proposed new rules for comment in the first quarter of the new rules that will apply to us are now expected to become effective on january   subject to transitional implementation arrangements  and will become fully operational on january   one year later than originally planned 
in addition to changes in the implementation schedule  the us regulators intend to introduce additional prudential safeguards to address concerns identified in a recent analysis of an impact study conducted with the us banking industry 
we will be subject to the new rules along with other large  internationally active us institutions 
in order to meet regulatory requirements designed to foster readiness for the implementation of basel ii  we have established a comprehensive implementation program to achieve basel ii compliance 
at this time  we cannot predict the final form of the rules in the us  nor their impact on our risk based capital 
state street corporation 
chartkdivshrvjpg 
we have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since over the last ten years  dividends per share have grown at a compound annual growth rate 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends paid to shareholders on our common stock  which was million in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the parent company had billion of liquid assets with which to meet dividend declaration and other payment obligations 
information concerning dividends from our subsidiary banks is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in  in connection with the gss acquisition  we issued million units of spaces sm 
spaces were collateralized  forward purchase contract units for additional shares of our common stock 
each contract had a stated amount of and consisted of a fixed share purchase contract and us treasury securities paces sm and a variable share repurchase contract covers sm 
the spaces investors received total annual payments of on the units  payable quarterly 
the present value of the contract payments totaled million and was treated as a cost of capital and charged to surplus upon issuance 
on november   we received proceeds of million and issued million shares of our common stock upon settlement of the paces 
the proceeds from the settlement were used to redeem million of capital securities on december  in february  we received million shares as settlement of the covers 
in  our board authorized a publicly announced stock purchase program for our common stock for general corporate purposes  including employee benefit programs 
during the first quarter of  million shares were purchased under the stock purchase program 
the program was terminated by action of the board effective february  in its place  the board authorized a new publicly announced program for the purchase of million shares of our common stock for other corporate purposes  including employee benefit programs 
during  million shares were purchased under the stock purchase program  and as of december   million shares remained available for purchase 
additional information about share purchases is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item in this form k 
we employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market for our publicly announced stock purchase program 
state street corporation economic capital during  we implemented a methodology to quantify our economic capital needs 
we define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target debt rating 
the capital committee oversees the management of state street s economic capital 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading  asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition business risk the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
because the amount of economic capital varies directly with our overall level of risk  it has become an integral part of our internal capital management process 
economic and regulatory capital are key metrics used by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
the framework and methodologies used to quantify capital for each of the risk types have been developed by enterprise risk management and global treasury and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles 
this framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the executive committee of the board 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to continue refining the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure  as described below 
global treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alco 
management maintains a liquidity measurement framework  including a funding contingency plan designed to manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities  and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
the plan outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies several triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of increases in potential cash needs or decreases in available cash sources and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
state street corporation we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level  but we also manage parent company liquidity separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs and those projected over the next one year period 
material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include  among other things  rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities below investment grade level  which would restrict our ability to access the funding markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as guarantees of third party debt under liquidity asset purchase agreements or large draw downs of existing lines of credit could require additional liquidity 
as of december   there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would adversely impact our sources of short term liquidity 
while maintenance of a high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash 
as of december   our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion 
securities carried at billion as of december  were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation 
based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current shelf registration statement  management considers overall liquidity at december  more than sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers 
state street corporation our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global funds markets and customer deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction in credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates 
there were no changes to our ratings in standard poor s moody s fitch dbrs state street corporation short term commercial paper a p f r mid senior debt aa aa aa aa low subordinated debt a a a a high capital securities a a a a high state street bank short term deposits a p f r mid long term deposits aa aa aa aa senior debt aa aa aa aa subordinated debt aa aa a aa low outlook stable stable stable stable contractual cash obligations payments due by period total less than year years years over years dollars in millions as of december  long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations covers  a component of spaces total contractual cash obligations long term debt above excludes capital leases reported as a separate line item and the effect of interest rate swaps

additional information about the commercial commitments disclosed in this section is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of state street s businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital 
we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board provides extensive review and oversight of state street s overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s key risk indicators 
these indicators are designed to identify major business activities of state street with significant risk content  and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement 
key risk indicators are reported regularly to the executive committee of the board  and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness 
modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a dedicated corporate group  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits  and with the support of business line management  monitors key risks 
the head of erm meets regularly with the board or a board committee  as appropriate  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties in the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the risk management function is responsible for designing  orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees 
the major risk committee  or mrc  is responsible for the formulation  recommendation and approval of policies  guidelines and programs governing the identification  analysis  measurement and control of material risks across state state street corporation street 
chaired by the head of erm  the mrc focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives  and also serves as the credit policy committee for state street 
the capital committee  chaired by the chief financial officer  oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances 
alco  chaired by the treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions 
the fiduciary committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers 
several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the mrc 
corporate audit serves in a complementary role to our risk management program  providing the board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to state street s policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls 
additionally  the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts 
the corporate compliance and legal groups also serve essential risk management roles 
corporate compliance is responsible for the design  implementation and oversight of policies  guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever state street conducts business  and monitors our adherence to corporate policies in our businesses 
the legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments  maximize business opportunities and minimize legal  regulatory and other risks 
while we believe our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified and anticipated 
for example  a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices 
state street is exposed to market risk both in its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes for these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
trading activities we primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs  customer requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
state street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework 
this structure includes a market risk measurement group that reports independently to senior management through erm 
market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use an array of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and control market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs  conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge volatility in net interest revenue 
in addition  we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets 
our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs 
state street corporation as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward contracts 
in the aggregate  long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
we use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques  including value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk management system to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions 
we have adopted standards for estimating value at risk  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
value at risk is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than of the time  or approximately three days out of the year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in foreign exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day 
implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 
the following table presents our market risk for our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology value at risk annual average maximum minimum dollars in millions years ended december  foreign exchange products interest rate products foreign exchange products interest rate products we compare actual daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk 
for the years ended december   and  we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate 
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within approved risk guidelines 
state street corporation our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco 
our global treasury unit has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related net interest revenue  global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
to accommodate our increasing non us dollar exposures and to further coordinate our global interest rate risk management activities  global treasury has established regional treasury centers in europe and the asia pacific region during consolidated balance sheet assets are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to synthetically alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivative financial instruments is subject to alco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivative financial instruments is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
as our non us operations have grown  non us dollar denominated customer liabilities have become an increasingly significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
we use two methods to reduce foreign currency translation risk invest in interest bearing deposits with multinational financial institutions in the same currency as the customer liability  and invest in us dollar investment securities after conversion from local currencies into us dollars using spot and forward foreign exchange contacts 
while foreign exchange risk has been mitigated  we do have exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
finally  gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities repricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we begin with two models nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and slow  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  that measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest revenue in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a liquidation view of state street 
both of these models are subject to alco established guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests by both global treasury and alco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of net interest revenue that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points  or bps  in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrower s prepayment opportunity 
state street corporation key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely calculate future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures set forth below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue dollars in millions rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and  assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity dollars in millions rate change bps shock bps shock while the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future nir or valuations  they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant  in the short term  falling interest rates would lead to nir that is higher than it would otherwise have been  and rising rates would lead to lower nir 
other important factors that impact the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  how quickly or slowly market interest rates change  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
one of the most significant assumptions underlying our modeling methodologies and the level of our nir is the reaction of our balance sheet liabilities  such as deposits  to movements in market interest rates 
customer deposit balances and related interest rates are an important element of the profitability of the overall customer relationship 
generally  we invest customer deposits in money market assets and high quality investment securities  the mix of which is determined by the interest rate and balance sensitivities of customer deposits under a variety of economic environments 
we regularly assess the characteristics of customer liabilities by product  geography  currency and customer type to ensure that the characteristics have not materially changed in a way that would create material risk to our nir and net interest margin 
state street corporation during  we performed a comprehensive review of the interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to interest rates paid and the level of balances 
the results of the review demonstrated a generally longer duration than previously considered 
the incremental exposures presented in the preceding tables as of december  reflect the results of this review 
incremental exposures as of december  were not comparatively restated 
credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms 
the extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities 
this concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships  increases profitability and minimizes risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
this model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on current economic and or customer financial indicators 
as a part of the implementation of the basel ii provisions  state street has developed and is implementing a new rating system for its various types of credit exposures 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
no provision was recorded in in  we reversed million through the provision as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality 
state street corporation at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  less than of total loans  unchanged from million a year ago 
changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  were as follows dollars in millions us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs commercial and financial recoveries commercial and financial transferred upon sale reclassification balance at end of year us non us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs reclassification balance at end of year non us total balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding in december  we completed the sale of our global trade banking business  which included the transfer of million of the allowance for loan losses 
during  we reclassified million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments 
subsequent to the reclassification  the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by million  and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses 
past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but where interest continues to be accrued 
there were no past due loans as of december    and there were less than million of past due loans as of december  to a non us customer 
we generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are days past due  or when management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
there were no non accrual loans at year end   and  and less than million at year end  all to us customers 
state street purchases securities under agreements to resell 
risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of transaction assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
state street also provides customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit  lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an extensive initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 
we lend securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions on behalf of customers  and in certain circumstances  we provide indemnities for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are well collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates rigorous credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of state street corporation of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
the borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as agent  cash and us government securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at december  and  respectively 
rigorous processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit related activities  which include cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  and foreign exchange trading 
as part of the approval and renewal process  appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the quality of the counterparty 
exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by erm 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
to the extent necessary  procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities 
total non performing investment securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  and from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing  confidentiality and fiduciary requirements 
active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which codify our approach to operational risk 
the guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
we maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
erm oversees the overall operational risk management program 
the mrc and the operational risk committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk  provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program  and escalate operational risk issues of note to the executive committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining and audit committee of the board 
state street s internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment 
our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
it is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential adverse event into operational and business risks 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain customers as a result of integration issues  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario state street corporation analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks is generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements assets under custody and assets under management are held by state street in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for our customers and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition  in accordance with gaap 
similarly  collateral funds resulting from our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  these assets are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
we sell and distribute securities for two types of off balance sheet entities that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about these special purpose entities is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the risks associated with providing administration  liquidity  and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines 
we believe that state street has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities 
as further explained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item  we utilize derivative financial instruments in our asset and liability management process 
recent accounting developments information related to recent accounting developments is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item state street corporation to our shareholders state street delivered value in we delivered value to our shareholders  our customers  our employees and the communities in which we operate 
we achieved this value by focusing on delivering for our customers  executing our plan against our goals  performing consistently for our shareholders  providing more opportunities for our employees  and continuing to give back to the communities where we do business 
our goals for included growth in operating earnings per share of between and percent  growth in operating revenue of between and percent  and operating return on shareholders equity of between and percent 
we achieved these goals  increasing operating earnings per share from continuing operations by percent and operating revenue by percent and recording return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of percent 
assets under custody hit an all time high of trillion and assets under management rose to a record trillion 
was our th consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth and our th consecutive year of dividend increases  which rose percent 
we also repurchased million shares of our stock  putting our share count at million shares outstanding  just as it was at the end of i measure the year s achievements in four ways 
financial we remained focused on the bottom line in  carefully balancing revenue growth with continued expense management 
this focus allowed us to generate positive operating leverage for the year  an objective i set out to accomplish when i took over as chairman and chief executive officer in july  and one that i continue to target 
i view our results as a start  and an indication that we are heading in the right direction 
business growth across the company helped fuel our revenue increase in we added more than  new investment servicing and investment management wins in  a result of our strong sales culture and our ability to execute 
state street global advisors ssga  our investment management arm and the largest institutional asset manager in the world  also posted significant growth in and improved its contribution to state street overall 
ssga now represents percent of state street s total pretax income  up from percent a year ago 
we continued to deepen existing customer relationships and expand new product capabilities 
these factors  combined with new business growth  enabled us to deliver what i consider to be better top line performance than our peers 
state street corporation we continue to see significant opportunities for growth outside of the united states  which accounted for percent of state street s revenue in  up from percent at the end of i have set a goal of increasing this number to percent over time  fueled in part by the growth of savings and retirement assets in europe and the asia pacific region and the globalization of investing 
in addition to revenue growth  positive operating leverage was achieved through expense control 
by monitoring our headcount  adding mainly to support new business wins and by better aligning our real estate portfolio with our needs  we slowed our rate of expense growth 
our strengthened and more cost effective global servicing model  shaped in part by new regulatory requirements  helped us to better serve our customers in the locations where they do business 
we now have processing hubs in multiple locations around the world including canada and india 
the centralized treasury group that we formed early in has improved management of our balance sheet  which is driven by customer liabilities 
to better position state street for rising interest rates  in we expanded the investment portfolio and adjusted the mix of investments to include higher yielding floating rate securities  ending the year with a conservatively invested portfolio  percent of which was aa rated or better 
customer state street s singular focus on providing large  global institutional investors with unparalleled service and value remained a differentiator for our company in our ability to handle complex transactions  create innovative solutions and improve efficiencies helped us to attract new customers and add significant value to our existing customer relationships around the world 
new investment servicing and growth in operating earnings per share investment management wins from continuing operations state street corporation major wins that fell into the expanded business category in included a landmark investment manager operations outsourcing renewal from scottish widows investment partnership in edinburgh  extending our relationship with this customer well into a second decade 
the year s biggest investment servicing win  from columbia management advisors  llc  the asset management arm of bank of america  gave state street a key role in one of the largest fund integrations in the history of the mutual fund industry 
this piece of business expands upon our existing relationship with a fund family that was acquired by bank of america and illustrates our ability to earn the trust and confidence of our customers  as does another investment servicing appointment from charles schwab investment management for billion in assets 
two wins from volkswagen group one in the united kingdom and the other in germany are further proof of our ability to expand many of the custody and accounting relationships we established years ago 
we also established many new customer relationships in in all major geographies and across all our capabilities 
these relationships include conducting one of the largest ever transition management assignments for a customer in japan and providing servicing and management for a wide range of pension and investment schemes in europe and asia pacific 
state street s ability to develop new products and services for both new and existing customers continues to set us apart 
state street global advisors played an important role during the year in helping to enhance asia s bond markets as manager of the abf pan asia bond index fund  a key component of the asian bond fund  an initiative developed by a group of central banks and monetary authorities designed to provide governments with an additional source of credit 
the fund invests in the local currency debt of eight countries in asia  increasing investors access to this vital region of the world 
increase in operating revenue consecutive years of growth in operating earnings per share state street corporation product innovation continues to be a focus for us 
state street global advisors developed several new strategies including global alpha plus  an innovative investment strategy designed to achieve consistent excess returns 
it also launched a number of liability driven investment strategies aimed at better matching assets to liabilities for pension funds

our research and trading capabilities  including foreign exchange  equity execution  transition management and securities finance activities  also posted record results in daily trading volume on fx connect  our multibank electronic trading system  surpassed billion and state street remained the unmatched leader in transition management  managing more than billion in transitions during the year 
continued demand for our quantitative investment research led us to expand our successful state street investor confidence index  which now includes regional views for europe  north america and the asia pacific region 
as we advance our effort to serve customers in all the markets where they do business  we strengthened our presence in in switzerland  the netherlands and hong kong  and opened a representative office in beijing  china 
these markets will play an important role in our goal to increase revenue outside the united states 
governance state street has made several recent changes to its corporate governance policies 
first  we created a new chief compliance officer position charged with centralizing and overseeing state street s compliance program 
our board of directors out of of whom qualify as independent under the new york stock exchange listing standards are now elected annually  eliminating three year terms of the past 
shareholders also now annually ratify the appointment of our auditors  ernst young llp 
in  the board adopted a majority voting standard requiring a director or nominee who receives a withhold vote from the majority of outstanding shares in an uncontested election of directors to submit his or her resignation  to be considered by the nominating and corporate governance committee 
state street corporation talent great companies are built around extraordinary individual execution 
we must continue to invest in state street s future by developing and leveraging our deep pool of talented professionals 
today  we are investing in our employees at a higher level than ever before 
in  we added more training  enhanced our salary and promotions process  and undertook several initiatives to move executives within state street globally to provide a deeper bench of talent that supports our succession planning 
one such example is the appointment in of bill hunt  an year company veteran  to lead state street global advisors

in  i believe state street became a stronger  more efficient and more focused company 
as we move into  i m encouraged that our business pipeline remains strong  and that we re executing well against our strategic objectives 
for  we have once again set financial goals of achieving revenue growth between and percent  earnings per share growth between and percent and return on shareholders equity between and percent 
we are currently targeting the middle of those ranges 
in my months as state street s chairman and ceo  conversations with our customers have assured me of one thing when customers come to state street  they get a value they cannot find anywhere else
