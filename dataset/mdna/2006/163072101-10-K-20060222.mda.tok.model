item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
as of february   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated seven upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark in sunrise  florida  garden city  new york  houston  texas  dallas  texas  los angeles  california  chicago  illinois and las vegas  nevada  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed two limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards also known as stored value cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants or on our website 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  all outstanding balances on such cards are included as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors are recognized upon transfer of title to customers 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
new restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales calculations in their th month of operation 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december st for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal and each consisted of weeks 
fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on january  the cheesecake factory is an upscale  casual dining concept that offers approximately menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelets and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe is also an upscale  casual dining concept offering approximately menu items 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except desserts manufactured at our bakery production facility are prepared on the restaurant premises using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering exceptional value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants distinctive  contemporary design and decor create a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants currently range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
total restaurant sales represented  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
overview in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and energy  purchasing power  and governmental regulations 
accordingly  as part of our strategy we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to protect their longer term competitiveness and to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand 
our strategy is to continue to provide guests with exceptional value through a broad menu of freshly prepared  high quality and large portion appetizers  entrees and desserts at moderate prices in an upscale  casual setting 
operationally  we strive to improve productivity and efficiency through the use of technology and a commitment to selecting  training and retaining high quality employees 
in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we believe the following are key performance indicators that should be taken into consideration new restaurant openings 
we intend to continue developing the cheesecake factory restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases 
therefore  we expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth will come from new restaurant openings 
we have opened new restaurants at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately in the years that we have been a public company 
based on a review of demographic market data in the us today  we estimate that there is an opportunity to open as many as cheesecake factory restaurants and as many as grand lux cafes in the us in fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including two grand lux cafes 
in fiscal  we expect to open as many as new restaurants  including as many as three grand lux cafes 
general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues 
leveraging our restaurant and bakery support infrastructure will allow us to grow general and administrative expenses at a slightly slower rate than revenue growth over the longer term 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support  training and field supervision activities of our business  in conjunction with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues operating margins 
operating margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor  other operating costs  such as restaurant level occupancy expenses  and preopening expenses 
our operating margins for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
our objective is to gradually increase our operating margin to on a sustained basis  before the impact of stock option expensing  by continuing our focus on superior guest service and by capturing economies of scale and fixed cost leverage  as well as maximizing our purchasing power as we continue to grow our business 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of revenues 
fiscal year revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks for fiscal after adjusting for million of revenues contributed by the additional operating week  revenues would have increased by to  million for fiscal on a week basis 
restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of restaurant sales contributed by the additional operating week  restaurant sales would have increased by to  million for fiscal on a week basis 
the resulting sales increase of million for fiscal on a week basis consisted of million  or a increase  in comparable restaurant sales and million from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
by concept  comparable restaurant sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased approximately and comparable sales at the grand lux cafes increased approximately 
sales in comparable cheesecake factory restaurants benefited from an approximate effective menu price increase implemented during january and february and another approximate effective menu price increase implemented during july and august however  sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants were negatively impacted in fiscal in the range of million to million by temporary weather related restaurant closures and a general slowdown in traffic resulting from hurricanes in the southeast 
we estimate total comparable sales at cheesecake factory restaurants would have increased approximately without the impact of the hurricanes 
this amount approximates our effective menu price increase 
since most of our established restaurants are close to full capacity during peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases 
sales in comparable grand lux cafes benefited from an approximate effective menu price increase implemented in october grand lux cafe sales were negatively impacted in fiscal by approximately million from the hurricanes in the southeast 
excluding this impact  we estimate comparable sales at the grand lux cafes would have increased approximately in fiscal on a week basis for fiscal  total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  for fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week at the cheesecake factory restaurants in fiscal decreased approximately to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in average weekly sales is due principally to two factors 
first  the average productive square feet and seats at restaurants opened in fiscal years and are approximately less than restaurants opened in fiscals and second  the weekly sales volumes at several newer restaurants are gradually decreasing  as expected  from their initial grand opening or honeymoon sales levels to their sustainable and expected run rate levels 
it is common in the restaurant industry for new locations to open with sales volumes well in excess of their sustainable run rate levels due to grand opening promotional and consumer awareness activities that generate abnormally high customer traffic for a period of several months 
in addition  fiscal sales were negatively impacted by the hurricanes as previously noted 
during  our goal is to open as many as new restaurants  including as many as three grand lux cafes 
due to the nature of the sites we choose  our opening schedule is consistently weighted toward the second half of the year 
although it is difficult for us to predict the timing of our new restaurant openings by quarter  due to the nature of our leased restaurant locations and our highly customized layouts  our current plan calls for two openings in the first quarter  two in the second quarter  five to six in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter 
based on this opening schedule  we plan to achieve approximately square footage growth in fiscal however  since many of these openings are late in the year  we will not realize their full benefit until fiscal we currently project our operating week growth in fiscal compared to fiscal on a week basis to be approximately 
we presently update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
for cheesecake factory restaurants  these updates generally occur during january and february the winter menu change and during july and august the summer menu change 
for our winter menu change  we implemented an approximate effective menu price increase for the purpose of offsetting those operating cost and expense increases that were known or expected as of january we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  holidays  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors referenced in this annual report on form k can impact comparable sales comparisons 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of bakery sales contributed by the additional operating week  bakery sales would have increased to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased sales to our warehouse club customers  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  as well as increased sales of the dream factory and private label products 
we currently expect bakery sales to increase approximately to in fiscal compared to fiscal we strive to develop and maintain long term  growing relationships with our bakery customers  based largely on our year reputation for producing high quality  creative baked desserts 
however  bakery sales volumes will always be less predictable than our restaurant sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of bakery product shipments and contribution margins on a quarterly basis  as the purchasing plans of our large account customers may fluctuate 
due to the highly competitive nature of the bakery business  we are unable to enter into long term contracts with our large account bakery customers  who may discontinue purchasing our products without advance notice at any time for any reason 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales and the increase in bakery sales during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include fresh produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
compared to fiscal  we experienced lower costs in most of these commodity categories  especially poultry  during fiscal we are currently able to contract for the majority of the food commodities used in our operations for periods of up to one year 
with the exception of cream cheese used in our bakery operations  many of the fresh commodities  such as fish  dairy  and certain produce and poultry products are not currently contractible for periods longer than days in most cases 
as a result  these fresh commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement of as much as million to million pounds during fiscal we have contracted for the majority of our cream cheese requirements for fiscal at a fixed cost per pound that is slightly lower than the actual cost per pound in fiscal we will also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past in reacting to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for these commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first to days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor  including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally in support of the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal as a result of higher minimum wages in several of the larger markets in which we operate and increased medical insurance costs  partially offset by menu price increases and efficient labor cost management 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first to days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
labor expenses can be subject to unforeseen increases for reasons beyond our control such as government mandated increases in minimum wages  paid or unpaid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits  or increased tax reporting  assessment or payment requirements 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses  taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of a reserve established in fiscal to accrue for estimated settlement costs and expenses associated with a lawsuit that was pending at the time  partially offset by an insurance settlement associated with our bakery operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses were for both fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support  training and field supervision activities of our business  in conjunction with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to increases in property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened cheesecake factory restaurants and two grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal compared to cheesecake factory restaurants and two grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
we also incurred preopening costs of million in fiscal in conjunction with our planned opening of a second bakery production facility  which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening costs for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of to restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of to hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  costs for practice service activities  and straight line base rent during the in restaurant training period 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel to and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in construction and or obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be caused by landlord delays 
our direct preopening costs for a typical single story cheesecake factory restaurant in one of our established markets averages approximately  there will also be other preopening costs associated with each restaurant opening  including costs for corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs will usually be higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for newer concepts such as grand lux cafe 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of a restaurant s opening 
preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal  preopening costs will exceed those incurred in fiscal due to the increased number of new restaurant openings planned in we also expect to incur up to million of preopening costs during in connection with our planned opening of a second bakery production facility and the potential opening of a new restaurant concept 
interest income  net  other income and income tax provision interest income  net  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to our higher investment in available for sale securities and an increase in the general level of interest rates during fiscal we generally invest our excess cash balances in us treasury and agency securities  investment grade corporate debt securities rated a or better and money market mutual funds 
in addition  we recorded interest expense of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower gains on sales of investments and marketable securities that were liquidated from time to time to fund our working capital requirements throughout the year 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be 
the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pretax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million consisted of million from comparable restaurant sales and million from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately to  in fiscal compared to  during fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year increased to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal this increase slightly exceeded our effective price increase for the full fiscal year of approximately due to the lower than expected sales in fiscal as the result of inclement weather 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales to our warehouse club customers  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  as well as increased sales of the dream factory and private label products 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales and the increase in bakery sales during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs for fresh poultry and certain non contracted dairy commodities  such as butter and manufacturers cream  during fiscal labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally in support of the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting the leveraging of the fixed component of our labor costs with the increase in revenues 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal during fiscal  we also accrued a million reserve for pending legal actions relating to alleged violations of california labor laws with respect to providing meal and rest breaks to our hourly employees see item legal proceedings of this report 
this increase was partially offset by a million settlement of an insurance claim associated with our bakery operations 
as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal including the net costs and expenses associated with the legal reserve and the insurance settlement of approximately million versus for fiscal  primarily due to the leveraging of the fixed component of these costs with the increase in revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally attributable to the leveraging of the fixed component of these costs with higher sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to increases in property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings and the purchase of a new office building to house our corporate offices 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were in both fiscal and fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened cheesecake factory restaurants and two grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal compared to cheesecake factory restaurants during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
interest income  net  other income and income tax provision interest income  net  decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to a higher level of investment of our interest bearing cash and short term investments in instruments with slightly shorter maturities than in the prior year 
this shift was primarily driven by the timing of funds needed for the purchase of our corporate support center and our new restaurant construction costs 
in addition  we recorded interest expense of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities that were liquidated from time to time to fund our working capital requirements throughout the year 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our corporate finance strategy is to maintain a strong  conservative balance sheet in order to support our growth plan with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery operations  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a much larger scale 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants  further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures  and maintain and expand our bakery production capacity 
in the past  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year adjusted net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year adjusted current ratio  end of year long term debt  including current portion  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures includes all marketable securities classified as either current assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively or noncurrent assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
represents deemed landlord financing liability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of january  this increase was principally due to cash flow from operations  landlord construction contributions and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by additions to property and equipment and purchases of treasury stock 
in the table above  we also present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations provide investors with useful information regarding our overall liquidity position because all marketable securities are readily available to meet our liquidity requirements 
we continue to target a weighted average maturity for our marketable securities investment portfolio between one and two years 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our investments is classified as noncurrent assets  but remains available for our liquidity requirements 
we have no funded debt in our capital structure 
however  landlord construction allowances related to restaurant locations for which we are deemed  for accounting purposes only  to have an ownership interest are reflected in our balance sheets as deemed landlord financing 
this liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
we maintain a million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility  which expires on december  as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
a portion of the credit facility  million  has been reserved to support standby letters of credit for our self insurance programs 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
upon expiration of the credit facility  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants  such as maintaining a minimum effective tangible net worth balance  with respect to the conduct of our operations 
we were in compliance with these covenants at january  our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
in the future  we may also develop more freestanding restaurant locations using both ground leases and built to suit leases  which are common arrangements used to finance freestanding locations in the restaurant industry 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional discussion on the accounting treatment of amounts paid for structural components and the related landlord construction contributions 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with secured financing 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our capital expenditures were million 
new restaurant openings including several restaurants under development as of january  accounted for million of this amount 
approximately million of new restaurant capital expenditures was funded through deemed landlord financing 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional discussion on the accounting treatment of amounts paid for structural components and the related landlord construction contributions 
of the remaining capital expenditures  million represented maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants  million related to establishing a second bakery facility  and approximately million was for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between million and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million to million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants and the new bakery facility 
this amount also excludes approximately million of landlord construction contributions to be applied as reductions to minimum or percentage rent over the lease terms 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each operating lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
this estimate contemplates a net outlay of million to million for as many as new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million to million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants and million to million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million to million related to the completion and enhancement of a second bakery production facility in rocky mount  north carolina 
we expect this facility to be operational in the first quarter of fiscal this facility will be built out in phases over several years to allow us to add production capacity  as we need it 
the initial investment is projected to be million  of which approximately million was incurred in fiscal based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flow provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
during fiscal  our board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization to  from  shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of million through january  our share repurchase agreement does not require us to repurchase any common stock and may be discontinued at any time 
as of february   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  amounts in millions total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of our leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum base rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
amounts represent noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and estimated construction commitments  net of agreed upon up front landlord construction contributions 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgment by management 
judgment or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases plus any exercised extensions of those lease terms  whichever is shorter 
for leasehold improvements purchased after the inception of a lease  the amortization period is the lesser of the useful life or a period that reflects lease renewals that are reasonably assured upon purchase 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that have been exercised 
the initial rent term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is also recorded to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space  the lease agreement and in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  during the construction period  the amounts paid for structural components will be recorded as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions will be recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction for those leases that meet the criteria of eitf  the lease may qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
for these leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress will be removed and the difference will be reclassified to prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 the deemed landlord financing liability will be amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure for each of these programs 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other receivables 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we maintain performance incentive plans under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  deferred shares  performance shares and performance units may be granted to employees  consultants and non employee directors 
to date  we have only granted non qualified stock options under these incentive plans 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
our policy is to grant all stock options at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
accordingly  we do not recognize compensation expense for company issued stock options in our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires compensation expense associated with stock options to be included in the financial statements beginning with the first annual period after june  see recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimates  which  in turn  could result in an adjustment to our effective tax rate 
we usually file our income tax returns nine to ten months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
the provisions of sfas r  as supplemented by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  are effective no later than the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june  we will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method in the first quarter of fiscal  and as a result  will not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation expense associated with stock options recognized in the first quarter of fiscal will include expense related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and expense related to all stock option awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we will apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
based on current analysis and information  we have determined that the adoption of sfas r will reduce our pretax earnings by approximately million in fiscal in october  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
this staff position is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and retrospective application is permitted but not required 
we currently capitalize rent incurred during the tenant improvement construction phase  which averaged approximately  per new restaurant opened during fiscal we will adopt fas for fiscal on a prospective basis 
in november  the fasb issued staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  but do not expect it to have a material impact 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which most recently increased in proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
several state and local governments have recently increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions and others are presently considering such increases 
additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating for all restaurants open as of january  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe winter weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal   and fiscal through february  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of january   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flows unless the securities were disposed of 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
in addition  we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
