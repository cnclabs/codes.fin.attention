overview revenues our revenues consist of three components net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
net sales 
net sales is comprised of sales of our biomaterials and endovascular products 
biomaterials 
in the year of our ipo  fiscal  our biomaterials sales were comprised entirely of the absorbable collagen and polymer components of the angio seal supplied to our strategic alliance partner 
since that time  we have experienced significant sales growth in our biomaterials products as we have expanded our customer base and marketing activities  increased sales to existing customers and assisted customers in the development of new product offerings 
the biomaterials component of net sales  which comprises of total net sales  represents the sale of our biomaterials products to customers for use in the following markets orthopaedics sports medicine and spine  cardiology  drug biologics delivery  periodontal and general surgery 
the two most significant components of our biomaterials sales are our orthopaedic product sales and the absorbable components of the angio seal  supplied to st 
jude medical 
our orthopaedic product sales consist primarily of sales to arthrex  a privately held orthopaedics company for which we manufacture a wide array of sports medicine products and orthovita  a publicly held orthopaedic biomaterials company 
we began working with arthrex in fiscal and have since provided arthrex with many varied sports medicine products for commercial distribution 
during fiscal  we sold our first bone grafting and spine products to orthovita  vitoss foam strips and cylinders  and in fiscal  provided additional product lines for orthovita vitoss scaffold foam shapes and pack 
below is a table showing the trends in our angio seal component and orthopaedic sales from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of our total biomaterials sales percentage of total biomaterials sales product fiscal fiscal orthopaedic products angio seal components orthopaedic products sales increased as a percentage of total biomaterials sales to in fiscal from in fiscal arthrex sales increased from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  additional product lines were developed and made commercially available  which increased our sales volume to arthrex during the fiscal year 
we continue to work with arthrex in developing new products as well as adding to their current product lines 
we expect growth in sales to arthrex to continue in fiscal during fiscal  we initiated business with two major orthopaedic customers  which resulted in product launches during the fiscal year 
sales to these new orthopaedic customers generated million in sales during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal we anticipate continued sales to these new customers during fiscal 
table of contents our increase in sales to arthrex and product launches for two new orthopaedic customers were offset by a million  or  decrease in orthovita sales in our fiscal from fiscal as anticipated and previously reported  this decrease in sales to orthovita is related to orthovita vitoss foam product launches in fiscal and fiscal the large volume of products shipped to orthovita in the prior years continued to flow through the distribution channels throughout fiscal although our sales to orthovita decreased year over year  orthovita s end user sales of the vitoss foam products are strong as they increased in fiscal over fiscal we are starting to see growth in shipments to orthovita as evidenced by combined third and fourth quarter fiscal sales to orthovita of million compared to combined first and second quarter sales of million 
we anticipate a return to growth in our vitoss foam product sales for fiscal angio seal component sales as a percentage of total biomaterials sales are consistent with fiscal percentages 
sales of the collagen plug component decreased by to million dollars for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june  the absorbable polymer anchor component decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june  this decline was the result of our supply of prior year increased requirements to st 
jude medical related to their capacity for a certain new version of the angio seal anchor 
going forward  we anticipate consistency in the volume of anchor component supply as the supply level has been formalized under our supply agreement with st 
jude medical  which was effective on june  under the supply agreement  st 
jude medical is required to purchase at least of their polymer anchor requirements from us 
the future of this portion of our biomaterials sales is dependent upon the continued success of the angio seal device in the vascular closure market 
today we estimate that the angio seal device has approximately of this market based on end user sales of approximately million in the fiscal year ended june  the angio seal market share may be impacted by future competition in this market or new technologies introduced to address diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of diseased coronary arteries 
overall  with the combination of our supply agreement with st 
jude medical  anticipated continued growth in angio seal end user sales  expected growth in the arthrex sports medicine product business  the products launched with our new customers  expected growth in the orthovita vitoss foam sales  and other new business opportunities  we expect growth in our overall biomaterials sales in fiscal due to greater market acceptance of biomaterials based products  we have been able to expand our customer and product base by initiating new partnerships within the medical device industry  as well as expanding the product lines for our current customers 
endovascular 
our endovascular product line sales began with the triactiv embolic protection system in europe in fiscal and has evolved to include the current product offering of the triactiv fx system  the quickcat catheter and the thromcat device in the us and europe 
we are selling these products in the us through our new endovascular division responsible for direct sales and marketing 
we believe our direct strategy in the endovascular markets will allow us to maximize our return with our triactiv technology 
in the us  we launched the triactiv system after receiving fda clearance in march late in our third quarter fiscal  we launched another product within our endovascular product line  the quickcat catheter  an aspiration catheter indicated for the removal of fresh soft emboli and thrombi blood clots from vessels in the arterial system 
sales of these two endovascular products in the us were  during the year ended june   which included  of quickcat catheter sales alone 
subsequent to year end  in july  we received k clearance of the triactiv fx system  an enhanced design with more ease of use features than the previous generation 
we launched this product in july while we received k approval for our thromcat device during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our product launch is anticipated in october of the thromcat device is a fully disposable mechanical catheter system that incorporates a technology to flush  macerate  and extract thrombus 

table of contents we are forecasting significant sales growth for our us endovascular products in fiscal based on availability and greater acceptance by the medical community of our new fx system svg embolic protection product  a continuation of the notable reception of the quickcat device in our fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as the launch of the thromcat device in the first half of fiscal in europe  where we sell direct in germany and via distributors throughout the rest of europe  the triactiv system was commercially launched in may we launched the second generation of the triactiv system  the triactiv fx in europe in april we received ce mark approval for the quickcat catheter in july and await thromcat approval which is anticipated during the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the proguard system for carotid artery embolic protection is expected to gain ce mark approval by the end of the second quarter of fiscal triactiv sales in europe were  for the fiscal year  a decrease from the prior fiscal year 
european interventional procedures in svgs have been substantially lower than analysts or the company s estimates previously indicated 
this has resulted in lower than anticipated product sales for the triactiv svg application in europe 
however  we believe the addition of the three additional products during fiscal  adding thrombus removal as well as a carotid application to the offering  will improve the total sales of endovascular products in the european community 
total worldwide endovascular sales were approximately of our total sales in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  we anticipate endovascular sales will become a more significant component of net sales during fiscal and beyond as we increase our sales of the product in the us market  gain new customers in the european and asian markets and introduce new versions and applications of the product in both the us and europe 
research and development revenue 
in fiscal  research and development revenue was derived from a three year million national institute of standards and technology nist grant received in october under this grant we were researching a synthetic vascular graft  also utilizing our ptm technology 
this project concluded in october in prior years  research and development revenue included additional revenue under additional grant programs 
in november  we received our first nist grant 
since that time we were also awarded a second nist grant and an nih grant 
under the first nist grant  a million grant over a three year period  we were researching cartilage regeneration utilizing our porous tissue matrix ptm technology 
although we continue to independently develop this technology  we received all remaining funds under this grant in our second quarter of fiscal in january  we received from the nih   over a one year period  under which we were researching sustained or controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer utilizing our ptm technology 
research under this grant was completed in early fiscal  but we are continuing to independently develop this drug delivery technology for commercial use and expectations of future grant applications 
we had no grant revenue in fiscal and do not project grant revenue in fiscal royalty income 
our royalty income primarily consists of royalties received from st 
jude medical and orthovita 
royalties from st 
jude medical are earned on angio seal worldwide net sales 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal device will grow in fiscal  with forecasted continued procedure growth and as st 
jude medical continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts and launch new generations of the product 
under our license agreement with st 
jude medical  there was a final contractual decrease in the royalty rate  to from  upon reaching four million cumulative units sold 
this final rate reduction occurred in april royalty income from st 
jude increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect that royalty income from the angio seal device will continue to be a significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of june   approximately million angio seal units had been sold 
under our march agreement with orthovita to co develop and commercialize the vitoss foam products  we receive a royalty on orthovita s end user sales of all such vitoss foam products 
in addition  in august we acquired the proprietary rights of a third party  an inventor of the vitoss technology  for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  the company receives an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss technology up to a total royalty to be received of million  with million remaining at june  
table of contents we received our first royalty under these agreements in the third quarter of fiscal  when orthovita launched its initial bone grafting and spinal product lines  vitoss scaffold foam stirps and cylinders 
royalty income from orthovita has increased since that time as orthovita has launched three additional product lines  vitoss scaffold foam flow  shapes and pack in june and october of and may of  respectively 
we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam products and the growing spine market will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income becoming more significant over the next fiscal year and beyond 
total royalty income received from orthovita in fiscal was million 
cost of products sold 
our gross margin percentage in fiscal was compared to in fiscal cost of goods sold in fiscal and included an accelerated depreciation charge of million and  respectively  related to our transition to our new facility 
fiscal also includes moving costs of  both the accelerated depreciation change and the moving expenses related to the transition to our new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition  we incurred  in equity compensation expense recorded costs of products sold during fiscal see the consolidated financial statements and note and liquidity and capital resources below 
the effect of these transition and equity compensation expenses on fiscal year and was a decrease to our gross margin percentage of approximately and respectively 
excluding the effect of these charges  we would have experienced a decrease in gross margin during fiscal of approximately 
the decline in our gross margin was directly related to several factors  specifically  obsolescence charges for process and raw material changes on one specific collagen product  unfavorable manufacturing variances related to production start up of three new products within the endovascular product line as well as two new orthopaedic product line launches 
in addition  there was an increase in personnel expenses in anticipation of the endovascular product launches 
we anticipate the gross margin on our biomaterials products will continue to improve with process improvements and continued increased sales volume 
occasionally offsetting efficiencies gained as products mature  are the margins achieved on new product launches  which are often minimal related to start up process inefficiencies and learning curves 
we initiated two new product lines during fiscal in our orthopaedic product line 
during the initial phases of production of these product lines we incurred higher costs due to the learning curve associated with initiating these new products 
while we anticipate continued improvement in the gross margin on some of our mature biomaterials product lines  these improvements will be offset by initial low margins of approximately to on the endovascular product line  associated with low volumes and start up inefficiencies  as we experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal our engineering teams are also working on process improvements and automation of production of the current endovascular products and we anticipate margins will come in line with our overall product mix during late fiscal and into fiscal as a result of our expanding product mix for fiscal  we believe our total gross margin  across all product lines  will be improved over fiscal  although with enhancements being made to our endovascular products there may be more obsolescence charges incurred during fiscal research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary technologies  such as the endovascular products  absorbable and nonabsorbable biomaterials products and technologies  and other development programs 
included in fiscal research and development expenses are an acceleration of depreciation charge of million and moving costs of  both of which were associated with the transition to the new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition  we incurred  in equity compensation expense recorded as research and development expense during fiscal see the consolidated financial statements and note and liquidity and capital resources below 
included in research and development expense for fiscal were the costs of our completed us clinical trial registry  the aspire angioplasty in svgs with post intervention removal of embolic debris clinical study  on the next generation triactiv system  the triactiv fx system 
the study commenced in march and completed enrollment in november 
table of contents in addition  in november  we commenced a european pilot study to support a ce mark application for a new version of the triactiv embolic protection system for carotid stenting procedures 
the trial utilized a new version of the triactiv system product line  which incorporates local flush and extraction lfx technology designed for use in branched arteries  such as those of the carotid blood vessels  the triactiv proguard system 
this device incorporates three features designed to reduce the incidence of embolic stroke during carotid stenting procedures a balloon protection guidewire  a flush catheter  and an automated extraction system to remove debris 
clinical efforts in pursuit of fda approval and continuing development of future generations of our endovascular products  as well as our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies  require significant research and development expenditures 
we anticipate research and development expense  including additional clinical trials  will increase as we pursue commercialization of future generations of the triactiv system in the us  and explore opportunities for other indications related to the triactiv system  as well as our other technologies  including the continued development of proprietary biomaterials technologies 
while we believe research and development expenditures will increase in dollars  we believe that they will decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
research and development expense was of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june   or excluding the effect of accelerated depreciation and moving costs  which will not be incurred in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  information technologies  human resource and business development departments  as well as costs related to the sales and marketing of our products 
we also recorded an acceleration of depreciation charge and moving expenses related to the transition to our new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources below of  and  respectively  in our fiscal year ended june  in addition we incurred million in equity compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal see our consolidated financial statements and note and liquidity and capital resources below 
the general and administrative component has increased over the same period in fiscal this increase is a result of the overall growth of our business and the administrative requirements to support such growth  such as personnel expenses  including an increase of  in equity compensation expense due to the adopton of sfas no 
r  share based payment and expenses incurred related to compliance with new sec and corporate governance regulations 
growth in the business has increased the requirements for planning  tracking and administrating sales of the endovascular products direct to the market 
the sales and marketing component of selling  general and administrative consists of expenses in the us and in europe related to the direct commercialization efforts for the endovascular products in both locations 
we have a forty two person endovascular sales and marketing team in the us and a five person sales and marketing team headquartered at our european subsidiary  kensey nash europe gmbh 
these teams are selling and marketing the product direct in the us and german markets and  in europe  the team supports our distributor relationships in the rest of europe and in asia 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased in fiscal over the same period in fiscal this increase related primarily to costs associated with building the new us endovascular direct sales force as well as marketing campaigns for launching our new endovascular products  including the triactiv fx and the quickcat devices 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in fiscal over fiscal as we expand our sales and marketing efforts of the endovascular product lines  both in the us and in europe 
we are also continuing to expand our marketing efforts for our biomaterials business 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal year  for the fiscal year and for the fiscal year our fiscal effective income tax rate includes tax benefits for research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income see note and our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we are forecasting an effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately 

table of contents income before taxes 
income before taxes decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this large decrease in income related primarily to an increase in expenses  rather than a decrease in revenue 
total revenue only decreased  in fiscal from fiscal a significant portion of the decrease in income was related to a million increase in facility transition charges for the move to the new facility see item above and liquidity and capital resources as well as a million dollar increase in equity compensation due to the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in addition  excluding the increase in transition costs and equity compensation expense  there was a million and million increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses  respectively 
both of these increases are directly related to our endovascular product line 
as stated above  the increase in sales and marketing expense related directly to building the new us endovascular direct sales force as well as marketing campaigns for launching our new endovascular products 
research and development expense increased primarily due to clinical efforts for and development of products within the endovascular product line

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab no 
sab s primary purpose was to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was modified as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
sales revenue 
sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed 
all of our shipments are free on board fob shipping point 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns  discounts and other allowances  if applicable 
the majority of our products are manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
research and development revenue 
revenue under research and development contracts is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
all revenues recorded on this line item are related to government programs under which the us government funds the research of high risk  enabling technologies 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
through the end of fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation costs under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which permitted i recognition of the fair value of stock based awards as an expense  or ii continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we accounted for our stock based 
table of contents employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb under this intrinsic value method  compensation cost represented the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date over the amount the grantee must pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we had not recognized any compensation expense for options granted to employees through june  options granted to non employees  as defined under sfas  as amended by sfas and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  were and continue to be recorded as compensation expense over the contractual service period using the fair market value method in accordance with sfas  which requires using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair market value of the option at the original grant date 
we granted options to non employee  outside consultants during fiscal and see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
we account for non vested shares to non employee members of the board of directors and executive officers using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb we granted non vested shares to members of the board of directors and executive officers during fiscal   and see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r which amended sfas and apb and requires that the cost of share based payment transactions including those with employees and non employees be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all share based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing or offering to issue its shares  share options  or other equity instruments or by incurring liabilities in amounts based even in part on the price of the entity s shares or other equity instruments  or that require or may require settlement by the issuance of an entity s shares or other equity instruments 
this statement was effective for the company as of the first interim period beginning after june   which was the quarter ended september  effective july   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective approach and now accounts for share based compensation applying the fair value method for expensing stock options and nonvested stock awards 
stock options 
stock options granted to employee and non employee members of our board of directors are recorded as compensation expense using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value is calculated under the black scholes option pricing model 
see note to the financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
nonvested shares 
all nonvested shares granted to executive officers  management and non employee members of our board of directors are recorded as compensation expense using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
see note to the financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of nonvested stock awards granted to the non employee members of our board of directors  our executive officers and certain of our other management 
we have implemented a practice of granting nonvested shares to the members of our board of directors as well as to our executive officers  as permitted under our stock option plans  as a component of board and executive officer compensation arrangements 
in response to growing industry concerns related to the effect of expensing stock options  we diversified our compensation arrangements to reduce the number of total equity shares granted to board members  executive officers and management team 
the compensation arrangements now include the granting of nonvested shares as well as  for executive officers and other management team members  a greater component of incentive cash compensation  with a lesser emphasis on options 
the first nonvested shares were granted to our board of directors in december  the first nonvested shares to executive officers were granted in july of and the first nonvested shares to other management were granted in september non employee stock options 
options granted to non employee outside consultants  as defined under sfas r  are recorded as compensation expense using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value is calculated under the black scholes option pricing model 
see note to the financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of options granted to non employee outside consultants in july and october 
table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities on may   we entered into a million aggregate ten year fixed interest rate swap agreement the swap  with citibank  na  to manage the market risk from changes in interest rates under a secured commercial mortgage see note 
this swap is a derivative instrument classified as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 no 
and no 
and is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  depending on our rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract  and measure those instruments at fair value 
the change in a derivative s fair value is recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income oci  depending on if the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so  the type of hedge transaction 
the effective portion of the interest rate swap gains or losses  due to changes in fair value  are recorded as a component of oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
we utilize the hypothetical derivative method in determining hedge effectiveness each period 
transactions that would cause ineffectiveness and result in reclassifying the ineffective portion into current earnings would include the prepayment of the secured commercial mortgage and or our election of the prime interest rate option 
interest expense is recorded in earnings at the fixed rate set forth in the swap agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  significant one time events and historical experience with each customer 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted 
we believe our allowance at june  was sufficient to cover all existing accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of certain estimated research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income 
material changes in  or differences from  our estimates could impact our estimate of our effective tax rate

table of contents total revenue and net sales 
total revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of products decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales of our biomaterials products decreased in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in biomaterials sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in product sales to orthovita  which were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as anticipated and previously reported  this decrease in sales to orthovita is related to orthovita vitoss foam product launches in the prior year and in fiscal which continued to flow through the distribution channels throughout fiscal although our sales to orthovita decreased year over year  orthovita s end user sales of the vitoss foam products are strong as they increased in fiscal over fiscal we are also starting to see a return to growth in shipments to orthovita as evidenced by combined third and fourth quarter fiscal sales to othovita of million compared to combined first and second quarter sales for the same year of million 
cardiology product sales to st 
jude medical  our largest cardiology customer  were million compared to million in the prior year  due to an  decrease in polymer anchor sales  a  decrease in collagen plug sales and a  decrease in development revenue related to research and development performed for two new collagen plug product enhancements in the prior year 
offsetting these decreases was a increase  or  in orthopaedic sports medicine sales from fiscal to fiscal mainly related to sales of sports medicine products to arthrex  which increased  or  additionally  we had million in spine product sales to new orthopaedic customers launching new product lines during fiscal in addition  endovascular sales of approximately million  increased from the prior year 
this increase was due to sales in the us of  and sales in europe of  endovascular sales represented of our total sales in fiscal research and development revenue 
there were no research and development revenues in fiscal compared to  of revenues in fiscal the research and development revenues for fiscal consisted of amounts generated under our nist synthetic vascular graft development grant  which concluded in september royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal angio seal royalty income increased to million from million in fiscal year and  respectively 
royalty units increased  as approximately million angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately million units sold during fiscal we believe that the increase in units is due to st 
jude medical s continued sales and marketing efforts  including the launch of a new version of the angio seal in march  which are resulting in greater market share and overall increased adoption of vascular closure devices in the market 
st 
jude medical s market share is estimated at in fiscal and worldwide market penetration of vascular closure devices is estimated at approximately in fiscal additionally  total royalty income from orthovita increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the fiscal year these royalties are received under the march manufacturing  development and supply agreement between our two companies and the acquisition of the separate vitoss proprietary rights from a third party inventor of the vitoss technology  both of which are discussed above

table of contents cost of products sold 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended change prior period to current period cost of products sold gross margin cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal related to the transition to our new facility  transition costs as a component of cost of goods sold were million compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
also increasing costs of good sold was equity compensation expense of  recorded in fiscal  related to the adoption of sfas r 
as mentioned above  gross margin excluding transition and equity compensation expenses was for fiscal compared to for fiscal  an unfavorable decline of year over year 
this trend is partially attributable to decreased volume but also related to late year obsolescence charges for process and raw material changes in one specific collagen product  unfavorable manufacturing variances related to production start up of three new products within the endovascular product line as well as two new orthopaedic product line launches and a mid year increase in personnel expenses in anticipation of the endovascular product launches 
we believe the endovascular product margins  which are partially offsetting the higher biomaterials product margins  will continue to do so until the manufacturing process for the endovascular product line matures and the start up inefficiencies and learning curve level out

excluding the effect of the transition and equity compensation expense increases  research and development increased from fiscal and was of total revenue 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to endovascular spending which increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal clinical trial expenses increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal due to increased clinical activity related to the aspire and the european carotid pilot studies 
also increasing were personnel expenses  including a  increase in equity compensation related to the adoption of sfas r  and a  increase in operational and design costs  all of which support the product line expansion for the endovascular platform 
of the million in transition costs relating to research and development   was allocated to endovascular research and development 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal biomaterials spending increased due to increased personnel costs of  including a  increase in equity compensation related to the adoption of sfas r  office and facility costs of  including a  increase in transition costs  and outside services of  offsetting these increases was a decrease in consulting services of  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we investigate and develop new products  conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our proprietary products

as of june   we had a total of us sales and marketing personnel  including sales representatives and clinical support staff  compared to a total of sales and marketing employees at june  including sales representatives and clinical support staff 
travel costs increased  due to recruiting and training conducted for the new sales team as well as travel to current and prospective customers and hospitals 
in addition  there was an increase of  in marketing expenses and professional fees related to conventions  advertising expense and a scientific advisory board meeting related to strategic marketing campaigns for the endovascular devices in the us finally there was an increase in office and facility costs due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in house  which included  in facility transition costs 
offsetting these increased us sales and marketing expenses were our endovascular european sales and marketing costs  which decreased  or  this decrease was due to a decrease in personnel and related decrease in travel expenses of  a decrease in clinical trial expenses of  due to the conclusion of the first study in december offset by an increase in marketing efforts of  the first study was a study to examine cost effectiveness of the triactiv system in saphenous vein graft patients to support reimbursement of the product in europe 
also affecting expenses was a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to increases of  in personnel costs  including  in equity compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r   in facility costs  including rent  electric  and depreciation and  in transition costs   in professional services  and  in public company expenses  including board compensation and sec filing fees 
excluding transition costs and equity compensation costs  general and administrative expenses only increased  or  in fiscal over fiscal net interest income

total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales of our biomaterials products  specifically our cardiology products  which grew in fiscal over fiscal cardiology product sales to st 
jude medical  our largest cardiology customer  were million compared to million in the prior year  due to increased collagen plug revenues  including  related to the development of two new collagen plug product enhancements 
sales of anchors to st 
jude medical decreased  from the prior year 
as previously discussed  orthopaedic sales decreased  or  from fiscal mainly related to sales of sports medicine products to arthrex  which decreased  or million 
this was almost entirely offset by product sales to orthovita that increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal in addition  triactiv sales of approximately  increased from the prior year 
this increase was due to sales in the us of  following the company s april launch of the triactiv system and first quarter of direct commercial sales in the us  and sales in europe of  which included sales of the new triactiv fx  which launched in late march the triactiv sales represented just over of our total sales in fiscal research and development revenue 
research and development revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist synthetic vascular graft development grant  which concluded in september in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under the nist synthetic vascular graft development grant and the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant  which concluded in september and october  respectively

table of contents royalty income 
royalty income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal angio seal royalty income decreased to million from million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the decrease in angio seal royalty income was primarily due to a decline  from to  in the contracted royalty rate which occurred in april the original rate of was contractually reduced from to  in accordance with our license agreements  during the fiscal quarter ended december  when a cumulative one million angio seal units had been sold 
one final contracted decrease in the royalty rate  to  occurred upon reaching four million cumulative units sold in april and was the effective royalty rate at june  the decrease in royalty rate was partially offset by a greater number of units sold 
royalty units increased  as approximately million angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately million units sold during fiscal we believe that the increase in units is due to st 
jude medical s continued sales and marketing efforts  which are resulting in greater market share and overall increased adoption of vascular closure devices in the market 
st 
jude medical s market share is estimated at in fiscal up from in fiscal and worldwide market penetration of vascular closure devices is estimated at approximately in fiscal up from approximately in fiscal and  respectively 
partially offsetting the angio seal royalty income decrease were royalties from orthovita on the vitoss and vitoss foam product lines 
total royalty income from orthovita was approximately million for fiscal compared to  for the fiscal year these royalties are received under the march manufacturing  development and supply agreement between our two companies and the acquisition of the separate vitoss proprietary rights from a third party inventor of the vitoss technology  both of which are discussed above 
also see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements patents and proprietary rights 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin was for both periods 
due to our plans to transition to a new facility  an acceleration of depreciation charge described above was recorded for  as a component of cost of goods sold 
offsetting this charge in cost of goods sold were higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable to higher volumes of cardiology product sales  which resulted in manufacturing efficiencies  increased volume in and additional experience on our spine product manufacturing processes  and continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  resulting in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins on biomaterials products were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv device related to low volume and the early stage of the manufacturing process 
we expect that the triactiv system margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal research and development expense also decreased as a percentage of total revenue to from for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the expense reductions were primarily due to the triactiv system on which spending decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal clinical trial expenses of  were million less in fiscal than in fiscal  due to the conclusion of the pride clinical trial in march clinical trial expenses in fiscal related to the triactiv fx aspire study 
this decrease was offset by increases in personnel costs  including travel expenses  restricted share and incentive compensation expense  facility and office costs  including the acceleration of depreciation charge  legal and consulting expenses  and operational and design costs  associated with new products  specifically the triactiv proguard system and the thromcat device 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending decreased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease were the efforts of several research and development personnel throughout fiscal on work performed for and reimbursed by st 
jude medical  resulting in the salaries and personnel costs of such employees being recorded as a component of cost of products sold as the related revenue was recorded as a component of sales 
this work included the development of three new product enhancements to the angio seal collagen plug 
the total of all applicable personnel costs related to this effort was  and was recorded as cost of products sold 
in addition  depreciation expense  excluding the acceleration of depreciation related to the facility transition  decreased  related to the conclusion of the nist grant 
depreciation on assets purchased for our nist grant were fully depreciated as of the conclusion of the grant in october  thereby reducing our biomaterials depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal offsetting these decreases  were legal fees which were higher related to a greater number of patent 
table of contents filings and increased patent maintenance fees of  and additional operational and design development costs of  related to development of new products and processes for our current and prospective customers 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we investigate and develop new products  conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our proprietary products 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to increases of  in personnel costs  including restricted stock expense   in facility costs  including rent  electric  but primarily depreciation which increased  including a  acceleration of depreciation charge described above   in professional services   in public company expenses  including board compensation and sec filing fees and  in bad debt expense 
in addition  general and administrative expense for fiscal includes  related to the amortization of intellectual proprietary rights acquired in august see note patents and proprietary rights 
personnel expense has increased primarily due to the issuance of restricted shares and the related expense which was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal professional service fees  which include audit and tax fees and sarbanes oxley consulting fees increased primarily as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of  for which the company expensed  in fees related to compliance for the fiscal year ended bad debt expense increased due to a prior year collection of a previously reserved amount of  in the current period bad debt expense was  resulting in a  cumulative increase from the prior year comparable period 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of our us commercial launch efforts for the triactiv system  which increased million in fiscal from fiscal personnel expenses for the us sales and marketing department increased  relating to the expenses of the endovascular direct sales force 
as of june   we had a total of sales and marketing personnel  including sales representatives  compared to a total of three sales and marketing employees at june  travel costs increased  due to recruiting and training conducted for the new sales team as well as post launch travel to prospective customers hospitals 
in addition  there was an increase of  in marketing expenses related to pre launch and post launch activities such as product training for the new sales team and the creation of marketing materials 
the triactiv system european sales and marketing costs decreased  or  this was due to the conclusion of the first study  a study to examine cost effectiveness of the triactiv system in saphenous vein graft patients  to support reimbursement of the product in europe 
this study concluded in december the first study results showed that the triactiv system substantially reduced day mace compared to a historical control of patients treated with embolic protection 
the reductions in complication rates will be used to generate a cost effectiveness analysis of the triactiv system which will be important for reimbursement in european countries  expected to be applied in fiscal first study expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  this was offset by increases in personnel  marketing and convention expenses of   and  respectively 
this was in part due to a increase in the foreign currency exchange rate as well as the increased marketing efforts related to the launch of the new triactiv fx system 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on our debt balance as we continued to make our required quarterly payments 
interest income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances decreased  this was more than offset by higher interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was  for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of  for fiscal this increase related primarily to  of revenue recognized from a  opportunity grant we received from the commonwealth of pennsylvania governor s action team see liquidity and capital resources section and note

there was a use of cash of  for an excess tax benefit from share based payment arrangements and a  use of cash to pay for the executive officers tax liability related to nonvested shares issued 
cash provided as a result of changes in asset and liability balances was  the increase in cash related to the change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid expenses million and a decrease in accounts receivable million 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventory million and an increase in deferred tax asset  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in prepaids and other assets primarily related to a decrease in deposits made on equipment ordered for the new facility see below in the prior year 
the equipment was placed into service during fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable was due to more timely payments by key customers throughout fiscal the increase in inventory related to an increase in the build up of endovascular product component parts inventory in preparation for anticipated market launches as well as a stocking of components for one of our primary biomaterial products 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to fiscal payments for services related to fiscal sarbanes oxley requirements and payments of clinical trial fees in europe for the first study which was completed in fiscal opportunity grant in november  the company was awarded a  opportunity grant from the department of community and economic development of the commonwealth of pennsylvania dced

new facility our new facility is located approximately two miles from the previous leased facilities in exton  pennsylvania 
the new building site consolidates all us operations  research and development  and administrative areas into a  square foot facility and thus provide for our future growth and continued expansion 
the construction plan had three phases 
phase one consisted of land  a building shell of  square feet and a fit out of  square feet for the manufacturing and quality assurance operations 
this phase was completed in december at an approximate cost of million 
the remaining building shell phases two and three is now complete and consists of  square feet and additional fit out of approximately  square feet 
the additional cost of phases two and three was approximately million in the aggregate  including the purchase of additional land required to complete the expansion 
in january  we purchased this additional parcel of land at the existing site for million 
the total cost of the project is estimated at approximately million 
associated with management s april  finalization of the plan for transition of its operations to the new facility  we recorded acceleration of depreciation charges related to the assets to be abandoned at the time of transition

general we plan to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund clinical trials  to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities  particularly for our endovascular products and our biomaterials products 
we are marketing and selling the endovascular products in the us through a direct sales force 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will increase substantially as we continue to invest in the build of our us sales team and increased marketing efforts toward the success of the endovascular product platform 
we believe our current cash and investment balances  in addition to cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months 
we also believe our cash and investment balances will be sufficient on a longer term basis  however  it will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development and costs associated with that commercialization  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearance by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing  sales  and marketing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
the terms of any future equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any current or additional financing will be available to us  or will be available to us on acceptable terms should such a need arise

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
investment portfolio our investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality municipal and corporate obligations 
the majority of the above investments have maturities ranging from less than one year to four years 
in addition  the company has one security with a maturity of approximately years 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and we have an audit committee approved investment strategy which currently limits the duration of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at anytime because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
additional information regarding our investments is located in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company investments 
debt on may   we entered into a million aggregate ten year fixed interest rate swap agreement the swap  with citibank  na  to manage the market risk from changes in interest rates under a secured commercial mortgage 
as of june  we have taken an million advance under the mortgage see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
our objective and strategy for undertaking the swap was to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows and interest expense associated with the future interest rate payments under the mortgage and to reduce our interest rate risk in the event of an unfavorable interest rate environment 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
additional information regarding the swap is located in note under derivative instruments and hedging activities and note to the consolidated financial statements of the company
