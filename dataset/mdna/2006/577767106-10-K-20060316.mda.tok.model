item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition  the discussion and the historical information contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including estimates based on our judgment in determining the allowance for inventory reserves  bad debt allowance  allowance for deferred tax assets and tax expenses in the future 
our estimation of liquidity for fiscal year may be significantly different than our actual results 
negative changes in revenues will affect our estimation in cost of sales  research and development  selling  general and administrative and other aspects of our business 
executive summary we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our business and strategic plan 
subsequently  we provide a summary of some of the highlights from the recently completed fiscal year  followed by a discussion of the different aspects of our business 
we then proceed  on page  to discuss our results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december   and for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  thereafter  beginning on page  we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our capital requirements and financing activities in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
beginning on page  we discuss our critical accounting policies  the impact of inflation on our business and new accounting pronouncements

table of contents during the year ended december   we completed the discontinuance of our winding equipment product line segment  which was sold in december  with the shipment of the final product order that we were obligated to fulfill 
therefore  the financial statements for fiscal  and include the reclassification of the winding equipment product line segment to discontinued operations 
highlights for  we reported revenue of million and a net loss of million  or per diluted share  versus revenue of million and a net loss of million  or per diluted share for fiscal the lower net loss was a result of higher gross margin driven by increased revenue across all product lines and reduced production costs 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on developing strategic alliances  introducing new products  improving liquidity  and reducing product costs and operating expenses 
some of these efforts are described below in february  northrop grumman space technology ngst selected maxwell s scs single board computer for spacecraft control and payload data management for the national polar orbiting operational environmental satellite system npoess 
we began hardware deliveries during the three month period ended september  in march  we received approval from the united states advanced battery consortium usabc to commence development of a compact  low cost  high performance  volt ultracapacitor based electrical energy storage module for applications in passenger vehicles 
in april  diehl luftfahrt elektronik gmbh  a leading producer of aerospace systems and controls  selected maxwell s boostcap ultracapacitors to power emergency actuation systems for doors and evacuation slides in passenger aircraft  including the new airbus jumbo jet 
in july  maxwell raised approximately million through the sale of common stock pursuant to a previously filed shelf registration statement 
in july  maxwell announced that orbital sciences corp 
selected maxwell s scs single board computer sbc to manage payload data for nasa s glory earth science mission 
glory is a three year mission that will investigate the composition of greenhouse gasses and the effect of solar radiation on the earth s environment 
in august  maxwell announced that its microelectronics unit had been certified to the stringent as quality assurance standard for suppliers to the aerospace industry 
this certification was granted after an extensive audit of maxwell s microelectronics unit verified that it meets aerospace industry specific quality assurance standards for design  development  production  installation and servicing 
in september  maxwell announced a compact  fully integrated  volt multi cell boostcap ultracapacitor module to ease integration for heavy duty transportation and industrial applications 
in october  maxwell announced that its bcap d cell ultracapacitor cells and multi cell packs and modules had successfully completed underwriters laboratories ul recognition process  qualifying them to bear the ul recognized component mark 
in december  maxwell raised approximately million  net of transaction fees  through the completion of a private placement of convertible debentures 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
half of the revenue increase came from the boostcap product line  which experienced increased demand for its products as well as growth from usabc contract revenue 
maxwell expects continued strong demand for its boostcap products in  however  contract revenue is expected to be lower in approximately of the revenue increase came from the high tension product line  which experienced strong demand from customers in asia 
management expects high tension revenue to continue to increase in  but at a lower rate than what was experienced in microelectronics revenue provided approximately of the revenue growth primarily due to revenue from the npoess contract 
maxwell expects microelectronics revenue to continue growing in driven by the npoess contract and other product demand 
revenue for the year ended december  included million in license fees received from yeong long technologies  inc yec and million from low margin magnetics based products  neither of which continued in gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
included in gross profit was the impact of contract revenue from both the usabc and npoess contracts 
these two contracts provided of the total gross profit for included in gross profit was the impact of license fee revenue from yec  which provided of the total of gross profit for excluding the impact of contract and license fee revenue  gross profit improvement during was driven primarily by the boostcap product line  which drove product costs below selling prices accepted at the end of boostcap volume increases drove of the gross profit improvement with the remainder driven by price 
reserves of million recorded for customer orders received in  which were priced below projected production costs  were fully utilized during additional reserves of approximately  were recorded in the first and third quarters of for customer orders received priced below production costs 
we have received a customer order subsequent to december  that is priced below projected production costs and will require a reserve of approximately  in the first quarter of we expect to continue driving down production costs to meet the pricing requirements of the markets in which we compete 
additional reserves may be required against future orders depending on the degree to which we are able to reduce our product costs at the time orders are placed 
selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for compared with million for during  we recorded  for stock compensation expense and  for severance pay versus  of severance pay during sales commissions increased  and audit fees increased  in versus the voluntary reduction in executive pay realized in was reinstated in  and accounts for  of increased sg a cost 
higher compensation costs  excluding executive pay  were  which was driven primarily by new hires supporting our growth 
stock compensation expense is expected to increase in the future as we implement the requirements of fasr in the first quarter of  and as milestones are achieved related to restricted stock awards 
research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for increased r d spending was a result of new product development efforts for boostcap and microelectronics product lines as well as 
table of contents higher spending on intellectual property efforts for patent filings 
boostcap development efforts included electrode  ultracapacitor  and module designs while microelectronics development efforts focused on single board computer development 
we expect to introduce a large number of new boostcap products in and  therefore  expect to continue our investment in r d at levels similar to provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a  tax provision during compared with a  tax provision during the provisions recorded relate to our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary had a tax holiday  which was extended in for an additional five years 
the extended tax holiday reduced maxwell s provision for income taxes by  in we have not recorded an income tax benefit for our net loss from fiscal due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the associated deferred tax asset 
however  we did record a deferred tax asset  of approximately million  and a deferred tax liability  of similar amount  for the embedded conversion rights of our convertible debentures 
these amounts are netted in the balance sheet 
additionally  we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets other than those related to convertible debentures 
should we become profitable  it is unlikely that cash payments will be required for income taxes during the time net operating loss carryforwards are available 
discontinued operations the winding equipment product line included in discontinued operations had sales of million and cost of sales of  during  which are reflected in income from discontinued operations 
there was no activity related to the discontinued winding equipment product line in see the discussion on discontinued operations in the to comparison below for more detail regarding the disposal transaction 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in revenue was caused by the planned phase out of low margin magnetics based products  which did not fit within the company s focus on high reliability products 
in the first quarter of  we recorded the final million payment in license fees received from yec in exchange for the right to manufacture our boostcap ultracapacitors in china 
the license fee payment is shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues for the year ended december  included million in license fees received from yec 
high reliability product revenues for both fiscal and were approximately million 
gross profit gross profit for was approximately million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for the prior year 
product gross profit  excluding yec license fees  was approximately million  or of product revenue  for  compared with million  or of product revenue  for product gross profit in improved dramatically approximately million  or compared with the prior year due to the focus on core high reliability product lines  the phase out of low margin product lines and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the improvement in product gross profit was partially offset by reserves recorded of approximately  in the first quarter of  approximately  in the third quarter of and approximately million in the fourth quarter of for ultracapacitor orders received that were priced below our production costs 
the orders placed in the third and fourth quarters of were part of a larger supply agreement 
we also recorded reserves of approximately  in the third quarter and approximately  in the fourth quarter of for excess and obsolete inventories 

table of contents selling  general administrative sg a expense sg a expenses were million for  compared with million for this represents a decrease of million  or 
during  we recorded approximately  in charges related to reserves against loans made to a former subsidiary and accruals for severance to the former chairman of the company 
reductions in the labor force in the fourth quarter of also contributed to the overall decrease in executive pay was voluntarily reduced in  which lowered expenses  as compared to the prior year 
the savings resulting from the reductions in labor force and executive pay were partially offset by increased costs of approximately million associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance activities 
research development r d expense r d expenses were million for compared with million for this represents a decrease of approximately  or 
our r d expenses varied slightly from year to year due to non headcount expenses relating to materials and outside services 
r d efforts are focused on our single board computer and ultracapacitor electrode and packaging technologies 
provision benefit for income taxes for  we recorded a  provision compared with a benefit of  during the provision booked in related primarily to the expected change in tax rates applicable to the net deferred tax liabilities for our swiss subsidiary 
the swiss subsidiary has a tax holiday  which was set to expire in and  therefore  existing tax liabilities would have been realized at the higher non tax holiday rate 
the tax holiday was actually extended in the income tax benefit recorded in related to losses incurred in our swiss subsidiary was offset against taxable income in discontinued operations in december  maxwell technologies  sa our swiss subsidiary formerly known as montena components ltd 
sold all of the fixed assets  substantially all inventory  and all warranty and employee agreement obligations of its winding equipment business  located in matran  switzerland  to metar sa  a new company formed by the former ceo of montena components and a metar employee 
the business was sold for  and we recognized a loss on disposal  net of tax  of  the new metar company completed during january through june certain work in progress related to customer orders received by maxwell technologies  sa before the date of sale 
we concluded our continuing involvement in the winding equipment business in the second quarter of with the shipment of the final metar product order that we were obligated to fulfill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations related to the winding equipment business which was recorded as continuing operations through the first quarter of have been reclassified as discontinued operations for fiscal  and the winding equipment product line included in discontinued operations had sales of million and cost of sales of  during  which are reflected in income from discontinued operations 
in march  we sold our government systems business for million and recorded a gain of million  net of a million provision mainly related to ongoing lease obligations 
as of december  and  the remaining lease obligation  which expires in april  is  and is fully reserved  and  with a reserve provision of  respectively 
divestitures in december  we sold our former i bus manufacturing and administrative facility in san diego 
the facility was previously classified as assets held for sale at its book value of million 
proceeds from the sale of the facility were million  resulting in a gain of million after payment of a loan balance with comerica bank and closing costs of  which was recorded in gain on sale of property and equipment 

table of contents in june  we decided to discontinue marketing and supporting our electronic components tester business and recorded charges in cost of sales of  primarily attributable to excess inventory and equipment   primarily attributable to warranty buy outs  and  primarily attributable to expected future warranty returns in the quarters ended june   september  and december   respectively 
we reversed  of warranty reserves related to the tester business in q sales for our electronic components tester business were immaterial in all periods presented 
in september  we sold the i bus phoenix  inc business for million in debt and certain other considerations 
we also incurred million in charges related to goodwill impairment and other asset write downs related to that business 
the loss on the disposition totaled million as we fully reserved for the note due to risks of collectability 
during  we received final settlement payments of  from the new i bus corporation  which was a partial recovery of the million note 
the recovery is reflected in gain loss on sale of businesses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in september  we also sold our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business for million in cash  of which million was held in an escrow account and subsequently released to us over the succeeding four calendar quarters 
we recorded a net gain of  in the fourth quarter of and recorded additional gains of  for the year ended december  other events in  and  we made an assessment of the company s goodwill and intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
accordingly  no goodwill impairments were recognized for the years ended december   and amortization of other intangibles was  for the years ended december   and and relates to the amortization of developed core technology acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena components and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell after the purchase of all shares not already owned by us 
interest income  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the large increase in net interest income for is due to investments in marketable securities of funds received from stock offerings and convertible debt issuance 
the gain on embedded derivative liabilities of  is related to the convertible debentures issued in december the initial fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants of million as of december  are treated as a discount to the million debenture and are amortized over the four year life of the note 
in addition  there are million of prepaid fees related to the issuance of the convertible debt  which are also amortized over the four year life of the note 
the  of amortization of debt discount and prepaid fees is for the period of december  to december  a full quarter s worth of amortized debt discount and prepaid fees would be  for each quarter in using the effective interest method 
the fair value calculation at december  was impacted by the change in maxwell s stock price  which decreased per share from december  to december  to per share 
the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants will be recalculated each reporting period and any difference in value from the prior period will be reflected in the statement of operations 
if maxwell s stock price were to be per share at march   we would recognize a million expense to the statement of operations due to the fair value calculation for the first quarter of fiscal the future impact of fair value recalculations will be difficult to predict  given the historical volatility of maxwell s stock price  however  it is a non cash item and will not impact cash flow 
an investment impairment of  was recorded in related to maxwell s ownership of approximately of a privately held company involved in support services in the areas of information technology  system and software integration and engineering and technical services under contract with various 
table of contents government agencies 
upon review of its annual financial statements and discussions with its chief financial officer  we were informed that the company had a negative net worth and had decided to restructure its operations to discontinue its information technology and software integration and engineering businesses and focus only on government contracting 
based on these facts and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to return to profitability  we concluded that the investment was impaired and we fully reserved for the investment 
in  we recovered  of the  recorded as impaired in and reflected the recovery as a gain on sale of business 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the use of cash for the years ended december    and was primarily attributed to operating losses from continuing operations 
our restructuring plan that started in was completed in early  and we started realizing the benefit of our restructuring effort during and performance indicators such as productivity  lower production cost and new product introductions have had a positive impact on reducing the net cash used in operating activities 
the increased productivity should continue to improve our gross margins and reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in during  accounts receivable and inventory balances grew in support of higher revenue levels  and accrued compensation increased due to severance for certain executives 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending has been focused on automating production processes for the high voltage and boostcap product lines 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which will be invested primarily in production equipment to increase capacity for the higher customer demand of boostcap products 
in february  we secured a million line of credit from a us bank  which was renewed in  that is available for working capital needs limited by the amount of eligible assets 
the line has not been used to date and we have decided to not renew the credit line  which expired as of january  we also have a line of credit for million swiss franc approximately million from a swiss bank for working capital in switzerland 
the line was fully used as of december  and we also have a million swiss franc approximately  term loan available from a swiss bank for capital equipment purchases 
approximately   was outstanding as of december  we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and approximately  in short term investments at the end of december we raised  net of issuance costs  approximately million in november and million in july from the sale of shares of common stock 
we raised approximately million  net of issuance fees  from convertible debentures in december in addition  the warrants issued as part of the convertible debt would provide million additional liquidity if fully exercised 
we believe the liquidity provided by the existing cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities  and borrowing available under our line of credit  will provide sufficient capital to fund our capital equipment and working capital requirements and potential operating losses for more than the next months 
short term and long term borrowings short term borrowings maxwell s european subsidiary  maxwell technologies sa  has a million swiss franc approximately million as of december  bank credit agreement with a swiss bank  which renews annually 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at 
borrowings under the credit agreement are unsecured and as of december   the full amount available under the credit line was drawn

borrowings under the credit agreement are unsecured and as of december   none of the overdraft credit line was drawn 
approximately  of letters of guarantee was outstanding as of december  primarily related to customer deposits at our swiss subsidiary 
in february  we secured a million credit line from a us bank for working capital purposes  subject to a one year repayment period 
in march  the credit line was renewed on substantially the same terms as the prior credit line 
the line has not been used to date and management has decided not to renew the line in  which expired on january  this line was secured by accounts receivable and assets of the company and bore interest at the bank s prime rate plus  but subject to a minimum interest rate of 
the agreement required us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of any consideration from future equity and debt transactions plus of net income in each fiscal quarter after the date of the agreement

the weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed at december  was 
maxwell sa had a loan from the montena sa pension plan for  swiss francs  or approximately  that was paid off during convertible debentures in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible debentures due and payable from december through december and warrants to purchase  shares of maxwell common stock 
the net proceeds of the issuance totaled approximately million after direct placement costs of approximately million 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of maxwell s common stock

table of contents  as amended  pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed on form s with the securities and exchange commission in september discontinued operations cash from discontinued operations has fluctuated from a use of cash in and to a source of cash in the use of cash from discontinued operations has been caused primarily by the purepulse business and by vacant facilities associated with the government systems business 
the source of cash in was a result of the discontinued winding equipment business  which generated sales of million in that more than offset the use of cash from the other discontinued operations 
the company expects the use of cash from discontinued operations to be significantly lower in than in as the lease of vacant facilities expires in april government audits the company was the subject of government audits of two businesses sold or discontinued in a contract  not assumed by the acquirers of the company s former defense contract business  entered into in and completed in the late s was being audited by the defense department s auditing agency 
the defense department s audit was completed in and the company reimbursed an immaterial amount to finalize the audit 
the internal revenue service irs had assessed the company with a penalty of approximately  for failure to file form w s for a business sold in the acquiring company of our former business did write the irs stating that they would be responsible for the filing of form w s 
during  the irs fully released the company from the  penalty 
the defense department s auditing agency is auditing a contract entered into by our microelectronics group as a subcontractor in and completed in the company has requested a release of liability from the prime contractor 
there is no assurance that such a release will be obtained or that the company will not incur some liability 
while management does not anticipate an unfavorable settlement of this matter  unfavorable results of the remaining audit would result in an adverse impact on the company s cash flow 
other events in  a customer brought to our attention a possible defect in a product that we source from another manufacturer and resell to the customer 
we are in the process of investigating this matter  but are not yet able to determine what  if any  warranty exposure maxwell may have  and therefore  we have not recorded any warranty reserve provision 
we carry insurance that we believe would cover all or a portion of any obligation that might ultimately arise from this matter 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries purepulse  which suspended operations in and is classified as discontinued operations  has minority equity investors 
these investors are former employees who were issued shares when purepulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity 
as of december  and  minority investors owned approximately of the outstanding stock of purepulse 

table of contents contractual obligations payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments debt obligations total operating lease obligations represent building leases  for us and switzerland locations as well as vehicle leases for management personnel at our switzerland facility 
purchase commitments primarily represent the value of non cancelable purchase orders and an estimate of purchase orders that if cancelled would result in a significant penalty to the company 
debt obligations represent long term and short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as us gaap 
we have used certain assumptions and judgments in the preparation of these financial statements  which assumptions and estimates may potentially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the following may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition for the fiscal year ended december   substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers and revenue recognized at the time costs were incurred for certain long term contracts 
licensing fees received for the right to manufacture our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors were another revenue category in fiscal years ended december  and product revenue is recognized  according to the guidelines of staff accounting bulletin numbers and  when title passes to the customer at either shipment from our facilities or receipt at their facility  depending on shipping terms  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
in general no discounts are offered and there is no right of return 
revenue recognized at the time costs are incurred is calculated on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and is limited by the funding of the prime contractor 
license fee revenues are recognized when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
in prior years  certain continuing and discontinued segments involved revenues from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized at the time the costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in the reduction of revenue in excess of estimated provisions 
in turn  this could increase losses for the periods in which any such reduction occurs 
excess and obsolete inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid 
table of contents technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition  price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods to reflect changes in market conditions 
we believe that future events are subject to change and revisions in estimates may have a significant adverse impact on the balance sheet and statement of operations 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the reporting units  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value  which was calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
we have determined the fair value of our reporting units based on the market value of the company s stock 
the market value of the company s stock at december  exceeded the carrying values of the reporting units and  therefore  the second step calculation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill was not necessary 
we cannot say with certainty that we may not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if the fair value of maxwell technologies and maxwell sa decrease due to market conditions  revisions in our assumptions or other unanticipated circumstances 
any additional impairment charges will adversely affect our results of operations 
convertible debentures we account for convertible debentures and warrants in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires the conversion feature of convertible debt be separated from the host contract and presented as a derivative instrument if certain conditions are met 
eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock and eitf  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in issue no 
were also analyzed to determine whether the debt instrument is to be considered a conventional convertible debt instrument and classified in stockholders equity 
the convertible debentures issued on december  were evaluated and determined not conventional convertible and  therefore  because of certain terms and provisions including liquidating damages under the associated registration rights agreement the embedded conversion option was bifurcated and has been accounted for as a derivative liability instrument 
the stock warrants issued in conjunction with the convertible debt on december  were also evaluated and determined to be a derivative instrument and  therefore  classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
the accounting guidance also requires that the conversion feature and warrants be recorded at fair value for each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in our statement of operations 
a black scholes valuation calculation was applied to both the conversion features and warrants at december  and december  the december  valuation was used for the effective debt discount that these instruments represent 
the debt discount is amortized over the four year life of the debentures using the effective interest method 
the december  valuation was used to record the fair value of these instruments at the end of the reporting period with any difference from prior period calculations reflected in the statement of operations 
the company s stock price is one input used in the black scholes calculation  which has a significant impact on the calculation 
the per share change in the company s stock price from december  to december  generated an  gain on embedded derivative liabilities in the statement of operations 
the volatility of the company s stock price is likely to generate large swings in the valuations of the conversion features and warrants in future periods 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r allows for either the modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or retroactive recognition  which may date back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
the company is planning to adopt the modified prospective transition method 
on april   the securities and exchange commission issued a final rule on the effective dates for application of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of the company s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  presently  the company has elected to adopt this statement effective january  the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the method of adoption elected  the fair value and number of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
assuming the application of the black scholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows foreign currency risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in switzerland 
maxwell technologies sa has euro and local currency swiss franc revenue and local currency operating expenses and loans 
changes in these currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue  expenses and debt 
we do not hedge our currency exposures 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million or million swiss franc denominated debt  of which  is classified as long term debt 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturity dates of these instruments 
we also had million of long term debt for convertible debentures issued on december   of which million is classified as long term debt 
we do not anticipate significant interest rate swings in the near future  however  the exchange loss or gain may affect the consolidated balance sheet or the statement of operations 
an increase in interest rates from to on our debt would have a million effect on our related interest expense 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  high quality corporate issuers and money market accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our current policies do not allow the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   third parties manage approximately  of the investment portfolio under guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the balance of our cash is invested in money market accounts with banks 
a change in the interest rate on our marketable securities would not have a material effect on our interest income 
the company expects to invest more of the funds raised on december  in marketable securities and  therefore  a change in interest rate would have a material effect on our interest income in the future
