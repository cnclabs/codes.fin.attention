the following discussions and the section entitled risk factors cautionary factors that may affect future results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview in  we continued to focus on our primary goal of managing the business to achieve profitable operations  while developing and enhancing products to drive revenue and earnings growth 
our challenge continues to be operating in the uncertain economic environment  while positioning data i o to take advantage of an anticipated recovery in capital spending 
we began to see a recovery in the first quarter of which continued throughout the year 
we expect that demand for programming capacity should improve in  in part based on third party forecasted increased unit sales for the semiconductor industry  which should provide improved business opportunities for data i o 
we are continuing our efforts to balance increasing costs and strategic investments in our business with the level of demand in and mix of business we expect 
we are focusing our research and development efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore architecture and the proline roadrunner and ps families 
in  we obtained the rights to certain in system programming isp technology 
we have incorporated this isp technology into our imagewriter product  and will be required to pay a royalty on product revenues associated with such technology until march  we began shipments of the imagewriter in the second quarter of  and in september we introduced the imagewriter the related royalties were not a material amount in to better support our customers in their geographic areas and time zones  we have expanded device support operations in germany  india and china 
our customer focus has been on strategic high volume manufacturers and programming centers and supporting nand flash and microcontrollers on our newer products to gain new accounts and break into new markets  such as microcontrollers for the automotive market 
we continue to expand our china operations to take advantage of the growth of manufacturing in china 
we continue to focus on building a services business expanding from our existing service operation model in brazil 
we also increased our efforts to recapture the japanese market and have entered into a distribution agreement with toyo corporation in japan 
we continue our efforts to partner with the semiconductor manufacturers to better serve our mutual customers 
business restructuring progress during  we took restructuring related charges of  primarily related to severance and completing actions that had been started in the second half of this aligned management operations with the changes made in to control costs in north america and europe and the need to build staff serving china and eastern europe 
at december    remained as accrued but unpaid restructure charges  which will be paid in during  we took restructuring related charges of  primarily related to severance and a small office closure 
these actions were taken to lower production and operating costs to reduce the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point  particularly in view of our reduced margins in the second quarter of  the continued need to control costs in north america and europe  and the need to build staff serving china and eastern europe 
during  we completed the restructuring that began during  which included actions taken to reduce the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point and realign data i o with our market opportunities 
this restructuring included the following a reduction in our global workforce  discontinuance or reallocation of numerous projects and activities not essential to our long term goals  streamlining discretionary activities  consolidation of numerous functions across the organization to create a team  which was more productive and able to respond faster to global customer needs  and closure of a facility in germany and moving our operations to other locations within data i o 
we required this operational repositioning because of the impact of the economic slowdown and the decline in capital spending across a high number of customer groups on general demand for programming equipment over the past few years 
our level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point increased in  primarily due to cost increases resulting from the impact of the weaker dollar on foreign currency based costs and from personnel costs due to raises  incentive compensation and selective hiring of individuals with critical skills to help position us as the continuing technology leader in our market 
at december  all restructuring expenses associated with the activities detailed for and had been paid and the excess expense accrual of  was reversed during critical accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  data i o evaluates our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
data i o believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition sales of data i o s semiconductor programming equipment requiring installation by us that is other than perfunctory were previously recorded when installation was complete  or at the later of customer acceptance or installation  if an acceptance clause is specified in the sales terms 
beginning in the third quarter of  data i o began recognizing revenue for these products at the time of shipment 
we began recognizing revenue at the time of shipment after we determined that our automated products have reached a point of maturity and stability such that product acceptance can be assured by testing at the factory prior to shipment and that the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements pursuant to eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element according to sab  revenue recognition 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to the collectibility of the transaction or whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
these conditions could be subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome 
installation that is considered perfunctory includes any installation that can be performed by other parties  such as distributors  other vendors  or in most cases the customers themselves 
this takes into account the complexity  skill  and training needed as well as customer expectations regarding installation 
the revenue related to products requiring installation that is perfunctory is recognized at the time of shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from the sale of service and update contracts as deferred revenue and we recognize it on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
we establish a reserve for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns and estimates for new items 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we base the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be adversely affected 
inventory provision we base inventory purchases and commitments upon future demand forecasts and historic usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  data i o may be required to increase our inventory provision adjustments and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals data i o accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
tax valuation allowances given the uncertainty created by our loss history  data i o expects to continue to limit the recognition of net deferred tax assets and maintain the tax valuation allowances 
we expect  therefore  that reversals of the tax valuation allowance will take place for the next few years only as we are able to take advantage of the underlying tax loss or other attributes in carry forward 
the transfer pricing and expense or cost sharing arrangements are complex areas where judgments  such as the determination of arms length arrangements  can be subject to challenges by different tax jurisdictions 
results of operations net sales in thousands net sales by product line change change automated programming systems    non automated programming systems    totals    net sales by location united states    of total international    of total vs 
revenues increased approximately million or in compared to the increase in revenue reflects strong sales of our ps systems  flashpaks and related aftermarket products 
we benefited from the programming centers adding capacity during which represented the major customer group for our ps systems 
while we did experience some decline in roadrunner revenues as the demand for automation capacity in the wireless segment declined  the number of new roadrunner accounts  especially within the automotive target group  increased in as compared to flashpak sales were especially strong in asia where manual programming is most common 
international sales increased slightly in total with significant growth in china 
however  our overall asian sales decreased as we experienced declining sales in our japanese and korean markets 
the us dollar strengthened slightly during  which had an unfavorable effect on our currency translation for sales denominated in foreign currency  and in particular the euro  which accounted for  offset to our sales increase 
our us sales increased approximately  or  which we attribute to improved sales to programming centers and automotive electronics manufacturers 
in  we began to ship the ps flashcore automated programming system and the imagewriter  our isp solution 
we expect these products to increase our revenues  however  partially offsetting this expected increase is the continued trend of declining sales of our older non automated product lines 
vs 
revenues increased in over this increase resulted from our automated systems sales including growth in the proline roadrunner  the ps family including the ps new in and the related automated systems aftermarket 
data i o s non automated systems continued a trend of declining sales in older products  however flashpak  our newer flashcore based programmer  continued to show good growth with sales more than doubling in international sales grew  particularly in asia  while sales in the us market continued to decline 
the us dollar continued to weaken in  which we believe assisted our export sales  due to increased buying power of foreign currencies and the favorable effect of currency translation for sales denominated in foreign currency  and in particular the euro  which accounted for  of the sales growth 
we see a continuing trend in migration of customers moving manufacturing operations to low cost geographies  thereby increasing international sales opportunities 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
gross margins increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales for compared to the increase in gross margin dollars was due primarily to the additional margin from increased sales volume of approximately  especially for the ps family and flashcore 
the increase in the gross margin as a percentage of sales results from a favorable average selling price variance of  offset by unfavorable currency exchange effects of approximately  similar to  the manufacturing overhead application variance was  unfavorable due primarily to decreasing inventory levels and lowering our rate standards due to productivity 
vs 
gross margins increased in dollars but declined as a percentage of sales for compared to the increase in gross margin dollars was due primarily to the increase in revenue dollars 
the decline in the gross margin as a percentage of sales reflects product mix shifts to those with higher material costs  as well as unfavorable average selling price variance of  and unfavorable manufacturing overhead variance of  the manufacturing overhead application variance resulted largely from decreasing our inventory level 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development r d spending during increased by  or over  but remained relatively consistent as a percentage of sales at approximately 
the increase in spending relates primarily to new product initiatives  particularly new automation solutions  the imagewriter  our new in system programming solution  and the start of engineering operations in china 
we shipped the first ps in early and the imagewriter product during the third quarter of data i o s r d continues to focus on the flashcore architecture  expanding its capability to address newer technologies as well as microcontroller device support 
we expect r d spending to increase as we fill open positions 
our r d spending also fluctuates based on the number and the development stage of projects 
vs 
research and development r d spending for as compared to increased  however  as a percentage of sales  r d remained about 
the increase in spending relates primarily to new product initiatives 
in particular  the imagewriter  our new in system programming solution  and edss  a tool suite for device support  were launched in november of data i o s r d focused on the flashcore architecture  expanding its capability to address newer technologies like nand flash support for m systems diskonchip technology as well as microcontroller device support 
new products in the ps family of automated systems included the ps flashcore  and  introduced in early  the ps flashcore 
also  we released a proline roadrunner version for panasonic cm machines 
finally  we completed our initiative to create global device support factories with the creation of our engineering operation in shanghai  china  which joins our other locations in redmond  washington  germany  japan  and india 
we believe it is essential to invest in r d to significantly enhance our existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
we are focusing our r d efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore and programmer architecture  new automated handling solutions  and enhancing our imagewriter products 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  in compared to based primarily on our operations in china which include increased costs of approximately  in addition  we incurred an additional  associated with the new information system which we acquired in  as well as additional accounting and the hiring of key personnel costs of approximately  additional marketing personnel and launch costs of  unfavorable currency translation impact of  from european based operating costs  an unfavorable administrative overhead application allocation amount of  and finally  an increase in senior management incentive pay of  related to profitability  offset by lower sales channel commissions of  vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  in versus the prior year due primarily to our strategic investments in china totaling  and the hiring of additional key personnel of  as well as the unfavorable currency translation impact of  from european based operating costs 
in addition  we incurred higher commission costs of  based on the higher sales volume and a higher mix of representative sales than distributor sales and higher travel and entertainment costs of  partially offsetting this was a reduction in bonus incentive compensation of  related to the net loss 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs 
interest income for increased due primarily to higher yields 
vs 
interest income for decreased as compared to primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities 
income taxes in thousands income tax expense benefit vs 
and vs 
income tax expense or benefit in all years relates to foreign and state income taxes 
impacting the effective tax rate related to foreign income were offsetting losses requiring valuation allowances in other countries 
we had income in some foreign operations partially offset by losses in other countries 
for financial reporting purposes  data i o established tax valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty relating to the realization of such asset values 
we had valuation allowances of million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
given the uncertainty created by our loss history  we expect to continue to limit the recognition of net deferred tax assets and maintain the tax valuation allowances 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the transaction losses resulted primarily from sales by our german subsidiary to our main customers  which were invoiced in us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to our foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital    at december   data i o s principal sources of liquidity consisted of existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our working capital decreased by  and our current ratio decreased from in to in our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during primarily due to cash used to purchase property  plant and equipment  including software  totaling million 
major capital purchases included approximately  related to the brazilian programming service operation and approximately  related to the purchase and set up of our new worldwide information system 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded by existing and internally generated funds or lease financing 
we also used approximately  of cash for operations which primarily included a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a  decrease in inventory   of demonstration equipment transferred to cost of goods sold  as we continually need to update to the latest versions of our equipment 
items not requiring the use of cash in operations were million of depreciation and amortization 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from increased sales especially late in the quarter and the longer collection times we are experiencing with increased international sales  especially in china 
during  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily due to a  decrease in accounts receivable   decrease in inventory   of demonstration equipment transferred to cost of goods sold  offset by a  decrease in accrued expenses 
in addition  we used million of cash in investing activities during compared to million during the decrease was driven by the level of investment in marketable securities and the level of cash available from net income 
as a result of our significant product development  customer support  international expansion and selling and marketing efforts  we require substantial working capital to fund our operations 
over the last few years  we restructured our operations to lower our costs and operating expenditures in certain geographic regions and to lower the level of revenue required for our net income breakeven point  to preserve our cash position and to focus on profitable operations 
offsetting these actions are our investments in expanded operations in china and brazil  in new system and equipment and hiring new key personnel 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least december  any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and or seek additional financing 
aggregate contractual obligations and commitments data i o has purchase obligations for inventory and production costs as well as other obligations such as capital expenditures  service contracts  marketing  and development agreements 
arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty  and with short notice  typically less than days 
any amounts reflected on the balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table below 
data i o has no long term debt 
data i o has commitments under non cancelable operating leases and other agreements  primarily for factory and office space  with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as follows for the year ending december  in thousands year years years after years total operating leases   commitments to suppliers  other purchase commitments total    off balance sheet arrangements except as noted above in aggregate contractual obligations and commitments  data i o had no off balance sheet arrangements 
share repurchase program under a previously announced share repurchase program  data i o is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
we may execute these purchases through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  and we may commence or discontinue at any time 
as of december   data i o has repurchased  shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of approximately million 
data i o has not repurchased shares under this plan since the second quarter of  although it still has the authority to do so 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
in march  the sec issued sab  share based payments  which gives guidance on the application of fas r and extends the required adoption date to january  for data i o 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of data i o 
see note for the pro forma impact on net earnings loss and earnings loss per share from calculating stock related compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas no 
r and under sab may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas no 
such potential differences have not yet been quantified 
also  past usage of option plans and stock purchase plans may not reflect our practices in future periods
