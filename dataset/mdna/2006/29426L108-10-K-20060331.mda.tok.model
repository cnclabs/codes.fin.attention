item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements the company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  as well as its quarterly financial data for the year ended december  and through september   which we refer to as the restatement 
the decision to restate these consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and selected quarterly financial data was made by the company s audit committee on march   following management s recommendation and based on management s determination that the company had not properly applied certain accounting guidance contained in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
specifically  the company determined that it had improperly applied the residual method under sop and as a result had incorrectly allocated revenue between license fees and maintenance in multiple element arrangements 
the company believes such restatement is required as under relevant securities and exchange commission accounting interpretations a misstatement concerning a segment of the company s business that plays a significant role in the company s operations may require restatement despite the size of the misstatement 
as the company s misstatement resulted in a reallocation of revenues between the company s license fees and maintenance  and impacted the timing of the recognition of these revenues  the company believed such misstatement to be material 
the information included in this form k sets forth the effects of the restatement on the previously reported financial statements for the years ended december  and and the quarterly financial data for the year ended december  and through september  as discussed in note and note to the consolidated financial statements

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the company operates in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the us accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and income tax provisions 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
in addition  the company has made estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets 
the company recorded a benefit provision for income taxes of million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses that were previously subject to a valuation allowance and lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions for year ended december   and  for the year ended december   primarily due to an income tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance 
the company had provided a valuation allowance of million as of december  on of its net deferred tax assets as it had been determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
as previously disclosed  the company continually assesses its valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets 
during  the company released the valuation allowance related to substantially all us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
for the remaining deferred tax assets the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
although the company has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer required with respect to the us federal deferred tax asset  recovery is dependent on achieving our forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
as of december   the company would require approximately million in cumulative future operating income to be generated at various times over approximately the next seventeen years to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company will review the forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change the company s assessment regarding the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional tax expense and could have a significant impact on the company s earnings in future periods 
additionally  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related interpretations  future period reductions to the valuation allowance related to scala s deferred tax assets that existed as of the date of acquisition of scala are first credited against goodwill  then to the other identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of acquisition  and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited to the income tax provision 
the company is currently under examination in various locations including the netherlands  united kingdom  and hungary 
the company does not believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
going forward into  the company expects to report an effective tax rate closer to the statutory rate as a direct result of its aforementioned release of its valuation allowance 
the company does not expect to incur significant cash tax payments until all anticipated net operating loss carry forwards are utilized

new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides new guidelines for the evaluation and determination of whether a loss on certain investments is other than temporary and requires certain additional disclosures pertaining to unrealized investment losses in a company s financial statements 
the effective date of the evaluation and measurement criteria of issue no 
has been delayed pending issuance of additional implementation guidance by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
the additional disclosure requirements  however  remain effective for annual periods ending after december  management continues to monitor the fasb s progress and does not currently expect the adoption of the evaluation and measurement criteria  as currently drafted to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position

management must also make certain assumptions about employee exercise habits  forfeiture rates and select an appropriate amortization methodology for recognizing compensation expense 
the statement requires a modified prospective method of adoption or modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense will be recorded in the financial statements for i all awards granted after january  and the ii future vesting of awards outstanding as of january  companies may also elect to restate their previously issued financial statements to provide consistency across all periods presented under the modified retrospective method 
management believes the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has selected the modified prospective method for adoption 
the company is still evaluating the impact of sfas r  but based on current methodology  the company expects stock based compensation to be approximately million for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents

the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
deposits with its us issuers may exceed the amounts of federal deposit insurance provided on such deposits and deposits held outside the us are not afforded such protection 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company has not experienced any losses on deposits of cash or cash equivalents 
the company s interest expense associated with its credit facility will vary with market rates 
the company had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
