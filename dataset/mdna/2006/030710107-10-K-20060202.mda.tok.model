item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ameron international corporation ameron or the company is a multinational manufacturer of highly engineered products and materials for the chemical  industrial  energy  transportation and infrastructure markets 
ameron is a leading producer of water transmission lines  high performance coatings and finishes for the protection of metals and structures  fiberglass composite pipe for transporting oil  chemicals and corrosive fluids  and specialized materials and products used in infrastructure projects 
the company operates businesses in north america  south america  europe  australasia and asia 
the company has four reportable segments 
the performance coatings finishes group manufactures and markets high performance industrial and marine coatings 
the fiberglass composite pipe group manufactures and markets filament wound and molded composite fiberglass pipe  tubing  fittings and well screens 
the water transmission group manufactures and supplies concrete and steel pressure pipe  concrete non pressure pipe  protective linings for pipe  and fabricated steel products 
the infrastructure products group manufactures and sells ready mix concrete  sand and aggregates  concrete pipe and culverts  and concrete and steel lighting and traffic poles 
the markets served by the performance coatings finishes group and the fiberglass composite pipe group are worldwide in scope 
the water transmission group serves primarily the western us the infrastructure products group s quarry and ready mix business operates exclusively in hawaii  and poles are sold throughout the us ameron also participates in several joint venture companies  directly in the us and saudi arabia  and indirectly in egypt 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting periods 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under part ii  item in addition  management believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ameron international corporation and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
the functional currencies for the company s foreign operations are the applicable local currencies 
the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company advances funds to certain foreign subsidiaries that are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future 
translation adjustments arising from these advances are also included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the timing of repayments of intercompany advances could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
additionally  earnings of foreign subsidiaries are often reinvested outside the us unforeseen repatriation of such earnings could result in significant unrecognized us tax liability 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income  net 
revenue for the performance coatings finishes  fiberglass composite pipe and infrastructure products segments is recognized when risk of ownership and title pass  primarily at the time goods are shipped  provided that an agreement exists between the customer and the company  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in limited circumstances within the performance coatings finishes group  revenue recognition associated with shipment of coatings for marine dry dockings is delayed until product returns are processed 
revenue is recognized for the water transmission group primarily under the percentage of completion method  typically based on completed units of production  since products are manufactured under enforceable and binding construction contracts  are typically designed for specific applications  are not interchangeable between projects  and are not manufactured for stock 
in some cases  if products are manufactured for stock or are not related to specific construction contracts  revenue is recognized under the same criteria used by the other three segments 
revenue under the percentage of completion method is subject to a greater level of estimation  which affects the timing of revenue recognition  costs and profits 
estimates are reviewed on a consistent basis and are adjusted periodically to reflect current expectations 
the company expenses environmental clean up costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations on a site by site basis 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters  as well as other pending litigation and asserted claims arising in the ordinary course of business  require estimates of future costs and judgments based on the knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when the company s exposures can be reasonably estimated and are probable  liabilities and expenses are recorded 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined principally on the first in  first out fifo method 
certain steel inventories used by the water transmission group are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
significant changes in steel inventory levels or costs could materially impact the company s financial statements 
reserves are established for excess  obsolete and rework inventories based on age  estimates of salability and forecasted future demand 
management records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical experience and expected trends 
a significant reduction in demand or a significant worsening of customer credit quality could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures or affiliates joint ventures over which the company has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  whereby the investment is carried at the cost of acquisition  plus the company s equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
investments in joint ventures over which the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the company s investment in tamco  a steel mini mill in california  is accounted for under the equity method 
investments in ameron saudi arabia  ltd  bondstrand  ltd 
and oasis ameron  ltd 
are accounted for under the cost method due to management s current assessment of the company s influence over these joint ventures 
property  plant and equipment is stated on the basis of cost and is depreciated principally using a straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets  generally three to years 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future  undiscounted cash flows from the use of an asset are less than its carrying value  a write down is recorded to reduce the related assets to estimated fair value 
the company also reviews intangible assets for impairment at least annually  based on the estimated future  discounted cash flows associated with such assets 
actual cash flows may differ significantly from estimated cash flows 
additionally  current estimates of future cash flows may differ from subsequent estimates of future cash flows 
changes in estimated or actual cash flows could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is self insured for a portion of the losses and liabilities primarily associated with workers compensation claims and general  product and vehicle liability 
losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the estimate of self insurance liability includes an estimate of incurred but not reported claims  based on data compiled from historical experience 
actual experience could differ significantly from these estimates and could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company follows the guidance of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and  in certain cases  the performance of plan assets that are controlled and invested by third party fiduciaries 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
such delayed recognition provides a gradual recognition of benefit obligations and investment performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans  based on various assumptions 
assumed discount rates are used to calculate the present value of benefit payments which are projected to be made in the future  including projections of increases in employees annual compensation and health care costs 
management also projects the future return on invested assets based principally on prior performance and future expectations 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company records in the current period 
management consults with actuaries when determining these assumptions 
actual results could vary significantly from projected results  and such deviation could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
unforecasted program changes  including termination  freezing of benefits or acceleration of benefits  could result in an immediate recognition of unrecognized benefit obligations  and such recognition could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the company changed the assumed discount rate and projected rates of increase in compensation levels and health care costs 
the discount rate is based on market interest rates 
at november   the company decreased the discount rate from to as a result of the market interest rates on long term  fixed rate debt securities of highly rated corporations 
in estimating the expected return on assets  the company considers past performance and future expectations for various types of investments as well as the expected long term allocation of assets 
at november   the company maintained the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption at to reflect expectations for future returns from investments in the equity markets 
in projecting the rate of increase in compensation levels  the company considers movements in inflation rates as reflected by market interest rates 
at november   the company decreased the assumed annual rate of compensation increase from to 
in selecting the rate of increase in health care costs  the company considers past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at november   the company increased the rate of increase in health care costs from to  decreasing ratably until reaching in and beyond 
different assumptions would impact the company s projected benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs related to pensions  and the accrued other benefit obligations and benefit costs related to postretirement benefits 
the following reflects the impact associated with a change in certain assumptions in thousands increase decrease increase decrease in benefit obligations increase decrease in benefit costs increase decrease in benefit obligations increase decrease in benefit costs discount rate pensions other postretirement benefits expected rate of return on assets n a n a rate of increase in compensation levels rate of increase in health care costs additional information regarding pensions and other postretirement benefits may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under part ii  item management incentive compensation is accrued based on current estimates of the company s ability to achieve short term and long term performance targets 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
quarterly income taxes are estimated based on the mix of income by jurisdiction forecasted for the full fiscal year 
the company believes that it has adequately provided for tax related matters 
the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions 
matters raised upon audit may involve substantial amounts  and an adverse finding could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
