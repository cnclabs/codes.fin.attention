item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our management team  under the guidance of our board  is currently conducting an inquiry into the events surrounding the revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter of and the resignations from the lenovo asiainfo division

table of contents industry background we operate in china s telecom software and it security products and services industry 
as substantial proportions of our revenues have been  and are expected to continue to be  derived from customers in china s telecommunications industry  we believe that developments in china s telecommunications industry have significant implications for our business 
the following discussion addresses developments in the telecommunications market and the it security market in china 
telecommunications market approximately of our revenues were derived from the telecommunications sector in  and we expect a significant portion of our total revenues to be derived from the telecommunications sector in according to china s ministry of information industry  or mii  in the number of china s fixed line phone subscribers increased by to million and the number of wireless phone users increased by approximately to million 
growth in china s telecommunications sector continues to be influenced by the country s overall economy  in which gdp per capita reached rmb  in  according to the national statistical bureau of china 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to china s economic growth and the telecommunications industry in china as of the dates indicated as of december  compound annual growth rate china s gdp per capita rmb fixed line telephone access lines in service in millions penetration rate wireless telephone subscribers in millions penetration rate internet users in millions penetration rate pursuant to the rate of exchange quoted by china s central bank  as of december  the exchange rate between the renmibi and the us dollar decreased to us rmb  compared to a rate of us rmb as of december  determined by dividing the number of subscribers or users by the total population of china 
sources data in respect of china s population and gdp per capita are derived from information published by the national statistical bureau of china  data in respect of mobile subscribers are derived from information published by the mii  data in respect of internet users are derived from information published by china internet network information center 
we believe the growth of china s telecommunications market has great potential for our business 
according to the mii  china s telecommunications business will maintain a growth rate of over with an annual business volume reaching rmb trillion in the mii predicts that the total revenue of the telecom industry in will be rmb billion  representing year on year growth of 
the mii also predicts that the number of mobile phone users in china will reach million in while the number of internet users is expected to reach million 
the mii s predictions also include an increase in the number of fixed line telephone users of million  to million in  resulting in year on year growth of 
among users of fixed telephone lines  those using personal access phone systems will grow by million  to million  in the mii further estimates that by the end of  out of every one hundred chinese citizens  will have fixed telephone lines and will have mobile phones 

table of contents in light of the increasing number of telecommunication users  we believe telecommunication operators are preparing to upgrade their current systems both at the provincial and municipal levels 
in  we launched china s first two metadata management platforms for two different provinces  as well as the first municipal data mart platform application 
the metadata platform improves the quality of an operator s data management through unified processing of metadata across all sections of its business intelligence bi system  while the data mart platform is designed to support municipal branches in making various thematic analyses with higher flexibility 
we expect to see substantial growth in the market for these data management and bi resources in it security market through our lenovo asiainfo division  we provide it security products and services to small and medium enterprises in china 
we launched our lenovo asiainfo division at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  in connection with our acquisition of lenovo s it services business 
the idc predicts that the it security product and service markets will grow at a compound growth rate of and  respectively between and while  during the same period of time  the entire chinese it market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 
despite increasing competition in the it security product and security service sectors  profit margins have been maintained at relatively high levels 
sales distributors have become a critical success factor in these markets 
some local competitors have moved from a direct to end user sales distribution strategy to sales via distributors 
in addition to the increasing demand for it security products and services from the telecommunications and financial sectors  the educational market has also started to display a stronger appetite for these products and services

in  we signed several significant telecom contracts  each generating over us million and we achieved a breakthrough in the china telecom fixed network market  signing a contract with chongqing telecom for our bi software solution package 
in  a new telephone registration regulation  requiring all mobile users to register under their real names  was promulgated 
we expect to see significant demand for our services to help carriers comply with the new regulations 
in fact  we are already working with shanghai mobile and zhejiang mobile to help move many of their pre paid users onto our bss oss platform 
the restructurings of china telecom and china netcom and the development of value added services have resulted in new requirements for the installation of sophisticated functions on those networks 
in particular  the chinese telecom industry has seen significant controversy over third generation g networks 
communication equipment manufacturers and fixed network operators without mobile licenses are urging the government to issue g licenses 
according to idc  while the timing of issuance of g licenses is still difficult to predict  it is expected to boost market growth  especially for billing solutions

in addition to the headquarters in beijing  there are also direct sales personnel in regional offices including shanghai  guangzhou and hanzhou 
sales of our security products and services are mainly made via our large number of sales distributors of which we have over which cover the entire country 
marketing both asiainfo technologies and lenovo asiainfo have marketing and strategy departments  which focus on strategy planning  strategic alliance development  market analysis and software product development planning 
in addition  we have a market communications  or marcom  department  which engages in a number of activities aimed at increasing public awareness of our products and services 
these activities include managing and maintaining our website  producing corporate and product brochures and monthly customer newsletters  conducting seminars and media conferences  conducting ongoing public relations programs  and creating and placing advertisements 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in the telecommunications market and in the market for it security services and solutions 
in the telecommunications market  our competitors include multinational companies such as amdocs  digital china  huawei  linkage and neusoft 
in the security products and services market  our competitors are mainly local players such as topsec and netscreen and international players such as cisco 
we believe that we have competitive advantages in our product and service segments due to our combined international and china expertise  customer centric and cost effective project management capability  and established customer relationships 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than we have  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
government regulation regulation of the telecommunications industry the chinese telecommunications industry  in which most of our largest customers operate  is subject to extensive government regulation and control 
currently  all the major telecommunications and internet service providers in china are primarily state owned or state controlled and their business decisions and strategies are affected by the government s budgeting and spending plans 
in addition  they are required to comply with regulations and rules promulgated from time to time by the mii and other ministries and government departments 

table of contents in september  china published the regulations of the people s republic of china on telecommunications  also known as the telecommunications regulations 
the telecommunications regulations were the first comprehensive set of regulations governing the conduct of telecommunications businesses in china 
in particular  the telecommunications regulations set out in clear terms the framework for operational licensing  network interconnection  the setting of telecommunications charges and standards of telecommunications services in china 
in the same month  china s state council approved the administrative measures on internet information services  which provide for control and censoring of information on the internet 
under regulations introduced in december of  qualified foreign investors are permitted to invest in certain sectors of china s telecommunications industry through sino foreign joint ventures  although there have been few reported investments of this nature to date 
these regulations  known as the provisions on the administration of foreign invested telecommunications enterprises  were the result of china s accession to the world trade organization 
under these provisions  certain qualifying foreign investors are permitted to own up to of basic telecommunications businesses in china  and up to of value added telecommunications businesses which include internet service providers and internet content providers and wireless paging businesses 
in january  the mii promulgated the administrative measures for telecommunications business operating licenses 
this regulation provides for two types of telecommunication operating licenses for operators in the prc  namely licenses for basic services and licenses for value added services 
in april  the mii issued a new classification of basic and value added telecommunication services 
the revised classification maintains the general distinction between basic telecommunications services bts and value added telecommunications services vats and attempts to define the scope of each service 
in particular  the classification delineated the differences between type and type value added services 
type includes online data and transaction processing  domestic multi party communication services  domestic internet virtual private network services and internet data center services 
type covers storage and retransmission email  voice mail  facsimile  call centers  internet access and information services 
as prc regulations restrict direct foreign ownership of vats businesses in the prc  in order to comply with these regulations  we have entered into various contractual agreements with certain individuals to establish a domestic company  beijing star vats technologies  inc  or star vats  to conduct value added telecommunications services business in the prc 
star vats obtained a license for operating value added telecommunications services type  issued by the mii in november at present  our product and services offerings in the vats area are still under development 
we anticipate that in the future we will offer customers various type services 
we anticipate that if we successfully launch our vats products and services  all of our business related to such products and services will be conducted through star vats 
star vats will receive any revenue we generate in the vats business and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not have any equity interest in star vats  but instead have the right to enjoy economic benefits similar to equity ownership through our contractual arrangements with star vats and its shareholders 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law firm  the contractual arrangements among us  star vats and the shareholders of star vats are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our chinese legal counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with star vats do not comply with its restrictions on certain foreign invested companies from engaging in vats businesses  we could be subject to severe penalties 
for more information on the regulatory and other risks associated with our contractual arrangements related to star vats  please see the discussion below in item a  risk factors 

table of contents regulation of computer information security products and services the computer information security industry in china includes products and services designed to protect the security of computer information systems  such as international inter connection of computer information networks  commercial encryption  computer virus detection and prevention  and network hacker infringement prevention and treatment 
the state council of china  the ministry of public security and other relevant authorities have promulgated a series of regulations regarding these businesses 
the regulation of the people s republic of china on protection of computer information systems security  published in february  was the first law in this regard  and has formed a legal framework for the computer information security industry 
the discussion below provides a description of the other primary regulations applicable to our information security solutions businesses 
regulation of systems integration involving state secrets in  the state secrecy bureau of china promulgated a special rule  known as the administrative measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets  which expressly prohibits foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets 
the measures also provide that a company must obtain a qualification certificate for computer information system integration involving state secrets in order to carry on such business 
regulation of commercial encryption businesses the commercial encryption administrative regulation  issued in  is the principal regulation governing the commercial encryption business in china 
commercial encryption refers to encryption technologies and encryption products utilized for encryption protection or security authentication of information that is not related to state secrets 
the commercial encryption administrative regulation also provides that encryption technology itself is a state secret  therefore commercial encryption technology is also regulated by the provisions of the management measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets 
as a result  foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises are prohibited from engaging in any commercial encryption business 
in addition  research  production  sale and use of encryption products in china are controlled by the national encryption administration committee on behalf of the prc government 
in december of  the state secrecy bureau promulgated three new regulations  which provided additional administrative measures relating to the production and sale of commercial encryption products and scientific research of commercial encryption 
all of these measures became effective on january  according to these new measures  production and sale of commercial encryption products may only be undertaken by companies that are designated by the encryption administration committee 
a company producing or conducting research on commercial encryption products needs to apply for certification as a designated commercial encryption product production enterprise or research enterprise 
a company selling commercial encryption products must obtain a commercial encryption product sales permit for selling such products 
a company holding such sales permit shall not sell any commercial encryption products that are developed or produced outside of china 
foreign ownership restrictions and license requirements we and our prc operating subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws  and are therefore subject to foreign ownership restrictions in connection with our security related businesses 
in order to comply with these restrictions  we entered into a series of contractual arrangements in connection with our acquisition of lenovo s it services business 
those arrangements enable us to operate the part of that business that constitutes systems integration involving state secrets including commercial encryption through affiliated entities in which we do not hold a direct equity interest 

table of contents we currently operate the restricted businesses through lenovo computer  which is owned by certain subsidiaries of lenovo and has been operating the information security solutions business for more than four years 
we intend to operate the restricted business through lenovo security technologies beijing  inc  or lenovo security  upon the receipt by lenovo security of all requisite business licenses and qualifications 
lenovo security has obtained the computer information system integration concerning state secrets qualification certificate issued by the national administration for protection of state secrets 
lenovo computer conducts  and lenovo security is expected to conduct  substantially all of our operations in relation to the restricted businesses  will generate substantially all of our revenue relating to such businesses and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such businesses 
we do not currently have any equity interest in these operating companies  but instead enjoy the economic benefits of equity ownership in such companies through contractual arrangements among lenovo asiainfo technologies  our wholly owned subsidiary  and these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders 
further information on these arrangements is set forth in the section entitled certain relationships and related party transactions in our definitive proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders  filed with the sec on march  upon the closing of our acquisition of lenovo s it services division in  our chinese legal counsel  t c law office  and chinese legal counsel to lenovo  tian yuan law firm  each delivered legal opinions to the effect that the structure of lenovo computer and lenovo security  and the contractual arrangements among lenovo asiainfo technologies  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders  were in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our and lenovo s chinese legal counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security do not comply with its prohibition on foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration involving state secrets  we could be subject to severe penalties 
for more information on the regulatory and other risks associated with our contractual arrangements related to lenovo computer and lenovo security  please see the discussion below in item a  risk factors 
regulations of acquisitions of prc companies by foreign entities the prc state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  issued a public notice on january  concerning the application of foreign exchange regulations to mergers and acquisitions involving foreign investment in china 
among other things  the public notice provides that if an offshore company controlled by prc residents intends to acquire a prc company  such acquisition will be subject to strict examination by the relevant foreign exchange authorities 
on april   safe issued another public notice clarifying the january notice  and on october  safe issued a notice  known as circular  which replaced the first two notices and set forth a new regulatory framework for transactions involving offshore companies 
under circular  if an acquisition of a prc company by an offshore company controlled by prc residents occurred prior to the various safe notices  certain prc residents may be required to submit a registration form to the local safe branch to register their ownership interests in the offshore company before march  the prc resident must also amend such registration form if there is a material event affecting the offshore company  such as  among other things  a change to the company s share capital  a transfer of shares  or if the company is involved in a merger  an acquisition or a spin off transaction or uses its assets in china to guarantee offshore obligations 
in the past  we have acquired a number of prc companies assets or equity interests through issuances of shares of our common stock to individuals who may be deemed to be prc residents for purpose of the safe notices 
however  there is 
table of contents substantial uncertainty as to whether we would be considered an offshore company for purposes of circular  thus giving rise to a retroactive filing obligation 
moreover  it is uncertain whether safe would impose any obligations on us in the event it determined that these prc residents have an obligation to register under the notices 
as it is uncertain how the safe notices will be interpreted or implemented  we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our future acquisition strategy and business operations 
for example  if we decide to acquire additional prc companies  we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such companies will be able to complete the filings and registrations  if any  required by the safe notices 
this may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects 
regulation of software production the chinese government has issued a series of incentives and preferential treatments for chinese companies that are granted the status of a software enterprise by the mii 
as set forth below under the heading certifications and qualifications  certain of our subsidiaries in china have obtained the software enterprise certificate and the key software enterprise certificate  which entitle them to enjoy certain tax benefits 
a discussion of those tax benefits is set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  under the heading taxes 
certifications and qualifications our products  facilities and activities must satisfy a range of criteria and conditions set by various industry bodies and governmental authorities in order to become eligible to supply our products and services 
in addition  some certificates  such as the software enterprise certificate  are not mandatory for our business but provide us with certain tax benefits

we have filed thirteen trademark applications with the united states patent and trademark office  five of which have been passed on to registration and eight of which are currently pending 
our trademark application covering asiainfo s logo and design has been granted by the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china 
in addition  we have filed three trademark applications for asiainfo s logo with the hong kong trade marks registry  all of which have been passed to registration 
we have filed five patent applications  of which one has received a patent and the others are currently pending 
we also have acquired some existing patents in the prc for certain hardware products used or developed in our information security business 
over two hundred versions of our software products have been registered with the state copyright bureau in china 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and consultants  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
since the chinese legal system in general and the intellectual property regime in particular  is relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to 
table of contents reuse or provide these developments to projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
employees we have approximately  employees 
we devote significant resources to recruiting professionals with relevant industry experience 
most of our senior management and technical employees are western educated chinese professionals with substantial expertise in information technologies systems integration and application software development 
we believe that our success in attracting and retaining highly skilled technical employees and sales and marketing personnel is largely a product of our commitment to providing a motivating and interactive work environment that features continuous and extensive professional development opportunities  as well as frequent and open communication at all levels of the organization 
our code of ethics in we adopted a code of ethics  or code  which applies to all of our employees 
in  we conducted a thorough review and update of the code in connection with the implementation of rules relating to codes of ethics under the sarbanes oxley act of a copy of the code and a brief description of any amendments to or waivers from the code relating to any of our principal executive officers or senior financial officers is posted in the corporate governance section of our website  which can be accessed at www

item a 
risk factors certain risks that may affect our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government telecommunications infrastructure and budgetary policies  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry in china 
most of our large telecommunications customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the national development and reform commission of china 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications infrastructure 
insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of china s telecommunications industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
historically  china s telecommunications sector has been subject to a number of state mandated restructurings 
for example  in china telecom was split geographically into a northern division comprising ten provinces and a southern division comprising provinces 
under the restructuring  the northern division of china telecom merged with china netcom and was renamed china network communications group 
table of contents corporation  or china netcom group  while the southern division continued to use the china telecom name 
as a result of the restructuring  new orders for telecommunications infrastructure expansion and improvement projects decreased  adversely affecting our revenue 
any similar restructurings of this nature could cause our operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter in the future 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers in the telecommunications industry  such as china mobile  china unicom  china telecom and china netcom group 
china mobile accounted for of our revenues in the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
despite our business development in the security products and services market following the acquisition of lenovo asiainfo s it service business unit in  the revenue expected to be generated by our business outside the telecommunications industry is still limited compared to our overall revenues 
moreover  we cannot provide any assurance that a material proportion of our revenues will be derived from other industries in the future 
our acquisition of lenovo s it services business and any future acquisitions or investments may expose us to potential risks and have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
selective acquisitions  such as our acquisition of lenovo s non telecommunications it service division  form part of our strategy to further expand our business 
if we are presented with appropriate opportunities that we feel will enhance our revenue growth  operations and profitability  we may acquire additional businesses  services or products that are complementary to our core business 
such acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash and or dilutive issuances of our common stock 
such acquisitions involve other significant risks 
for example  our integration of such acquired entities and or operations into our business may not be successful and may not enable us to expand into new business platforms as well as we expect 
this would significantly affect the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
moreover  the integration of new businesses into our operations has required significant attention from our management 
future acquisitions will also likely present similar challenges 
the security products and services business unit we acquired from lenovo in faced strong challenges in the final months of it experienced significantly lower shipment volume than we anticipated and made only a nominal contribution to our revenue for the fourth quarter 
as a result  full year earnings for lenovo asiainfo were significantly below our expectations 
following the disappointing quarter  mr 
yu bing  formerly chief executive officer of the lenovo asiainfo division and member of our board  submitted his resignation 
we also received resignations from approximately other employees in our lenovo asiainfo division 
our management team  under the guidance of our board  is currently conducting an inquiry into the events surrounding the revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter of and the resignations from the lenovo asiainfo division 
based on the progress of that inquiry to date  we believe that the shortfall was  at least in part  the result of unexcused absences on the part of employees in our security division during the quarter 
our inquiry into this matter is ongoing  and we intend to seek appropriate remedies if we determine such action is warranted 
the acquisition of lenovo s non telecommunications it services division and possible future acquisitions may also expose us to other potential risks  including risks associated with unforeseen or hidden liabilities  the diversion of resources from our existing businesses and potential loss  or harm to  relationships with employees and clients as a result of our integration of new businesses 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to realize the benefits we anticipate from acquiring any companies  or that we will not incur costs  including those relating to intangible assets or goodwill  in excess of our projected costs for these transactions 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to manage our business  our financial condition and our results of operations 

table of contents the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers often operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
a large part of the contract amount of our projects often relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of services and software revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly gross revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be overly relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than any corresponding decline in our operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries could cause our working capital needs to increase significantly 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we had net income in  and  we sustained net losses in and there are no assurances that we can sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage of those expenses  particularly compensation expenses  will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
our high level of fixed costs  as well as increased competition in the software market  could result in reduced operating margins 
we maintain a relatively stable work force of software and network engineers engaged in all phases of planning and executing projects on behalf of our customers 
as a result  our operating costs are relatively fixed from quarter to quarter  regardless of fluctuations in our revenues 
future fluctuations in our revenues could result in decreases in our operating margins 
in addition  enhanced competition in the software market and other markets in which we operate could result in reduced prices  which  together with our relatively fixed operating costs  could also result in reduced operating margins 

table of contents prc laws and regulations currently prohibit foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  which is part of the it services business we acquired from lenovo in prc laws and regulations also restrict certain foreign invested companies from participating in the vats business  which we are exploring the possibility of entering 
substantial uncertainties exist with respect to our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer  lenovo security and star vats  due to uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations 
in  the state secrecy bureau of china promulgated the administrative measures for qualification of computer information systems integration involving state secrets  which expressly prohibits foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  also referred to as restricted businesses 
we and our prc operating subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws 
in addition to a number of other types of it services  one of the businesses operated by the it services division we acquired from lenovo in was a restricted business 
we currently operate the restricted business through lenovo computer 
we intend to operate the restricted business through lenovo security  upon the receipt by lenovo security of all requisite business licenses and qualifications 
lenovo security has obtained the computer information system integration concerning state secrets qualification certificate issued by the national administration for protection of state secrets 
lenovo computer is owned by certain subsidiaries of lenovo 
lenovo security is owned by legend holdings limited  the parent company and controlling shareholder of lenovo  and one of our employees and one of our directors who are prc citizens 
lenovo computer currently conducts substantially all of our operations in relation to the restricted business  generates substantially all of our revenue relating to such business  and makes use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not currently have any equity interest in lenovo computer or lenovo security and instead enjoy economic benefits substantially similar to equity ownership in such companies through contractual arrangements between lenovo asiainfo technologies  inc  or lenovo asiainfo  our wholly owned subsidiary  and these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders 
further information on these arrangements is set forth under the heading certain relationships and related transactions in the definitive proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders  to be filed with the sec on or about the date of this report 
at the closing of our acquisition of lenovo s it services business  our chinese legal counsel  t c law office  and chinese legal counsel to lenovo group  tian yuan law firm  each delivered legal opinions to the effect that our ownership structure of lenovo computer and lenovo security  and the contractual arrangements among us  lenovo asiainfo  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders  are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our and lenovo s chinese counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security do not comply with the prohibition on foreign invested companies from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets  we could be subject to severe penalties 
in june of we entered into similar contractual arrangements with star vats  a domestic company owned by certain of our employees who are prc citizens  which has been established to engage in the vats business in china 
star vats is in the process of developing vats products and services that we hope to offer in china 
we anticipate that if we successfully launch our vats products and services  all of our business related to such products and services will be conducted through star vats 
star vats will generate any revenue relating to such business and will make use of the licenses and approvals that are essential to such business 
we do not have any equity interest in star vats  but instead have the right to enjoy economic benefits similar to equity ownership through our contractual arrangements with star vats and its shareholders 
in the opinion of our chinese legal counsel  t c law firm  the contractual arrangements among us  star vats  and the shareholders 
table of contents of star vats are in compliance with all existing prc laws and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future prc laws and regulations  including regulations governing the validity and enforcement of such contractual arrangements 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that prc government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our chinese legal counsel 
if the prc government finds that our contractual arrangements with star vats do not comply with the restrictions on certain foreign invested companies from engaging in vats businesses  we could be subject to severe penalties 
our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer  lenovo security and star vats may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership of these affiliated entities and may be difficult to enforce 
although we have been advised by chinese legal counsel that our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer  lenovo security and star vats are valid  binding and enforceable under current prc laws  these arrangements may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership of these affiliated entities would be 
for example  these affiliated entities and their respective shareholders could fail to perform or make payments as required under such contractual arrangements 
in such event  we would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce these agreements 
any legal proceedings would be uncertain as to outcome and could result in the disruption of our business  damage to our reputation  diversion of our resources and the incurrence of substantial costs 
we may not be able to operate the systems integration businesses involving state secrets once we acquire all of the equity interest in lenovo computer and lenovo security 
prc laws and regulations currently prohibit foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises from engaging in systems integration businesses involving state secrets 
we and our subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign invested enterprises under prc laws 
unless such prohibition is lifted in the future  we will not be able to operate such business after we acquire all of the equity interest in lenovo computer and lenovo security pursuant to the terms of our contractual arrangements with lenovo computer and lenovo security and their respective shareholders 
the loss of this line of business may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent prc regulations relating to acquisitions of prc companies by foreign entities may limit our ability to acquire prc companies and adversely affect the implementation of our acquisition strategy  and the failure by our shareholders who are prc residents to make or obtain any required registrations pursuant to such regulations may subject us to legal sanctions 
the prc state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  issued a public notice on january  concerning the application of foreign exchange regulations to mergers and acquisitions involving foreign investment in china 
among other things  the public notice provides that if an offshore company controlled by prc residents intends to acquire a prc company  such acquisition will be subject to strict examination by the relevant foreign exchange authorities 
on april   safe issued another public notice clarifying the january notice  and on october  safe issued a third notice  known as circular  which replaced the first two notices and set forth a new regulatory framework for transactions involving offshore companies 
under circular  if an acquisition of a prc company by an offshore company controlled by prc residents occurred prior to the various safe notices  certain prc residents may be required to submit a registration form to the local safe branch to register their ownership interests in the offshore company before march  the prc resident must also amend such registration form if there is a material event affecting the offshore company  such as  among other things  a change in share capital  a transfer of shares  or if such company is involved in a merger  acquisition or a spin off transaction or uses its assets in china to guarantee offshore obligations 
in the past  we have acquired a number of assets from  or equity interests in  prc companies through issuances of our shares of common stock to 
table of contents individuals who may be deemed to be prc residents for the purpose of the safe notices 
however  there is substantial uncertainty as to whether we would be considered an offshore company for purposes of circular  thus giving rise to a retroactive filing obligation 
moreover  it is uncertain whether safe would impose any obligations on us in the event it determines that these prc residents have an obligation to register under the notices 
as it is uncertain how the safe notices will be interpreted or implemented  we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our future acquisition strategy and business operations 
for example  if we decide to acquire additional prc companies  we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such companies will be able to complete the filings and registrations  if any  required by the safe notices 
this may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects 
asset impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires us  among other things  to conduct annual reviews of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
in connection with our business acquisitions  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the related useful lives of those assets  we have to make assumptions regarding their fair value  our recoverability of those assets and our ability to successfully develop and ultimately commercialize acquired technology 
if those assumptions change in the future when we conduct our periodic reviews in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million as a result of an independent valuation during the fourth quarter of of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets mainly attributable to our acquisition of lenovo asiainfo s it service business unit in it is possible that future reviews will result in further write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
each of our executive officers is responsible for an important segment of our operations 
although we believe that we have significant depth at all levels of management  the loss of any of our executive officers services could be detrimental to our operations 
we do not have  and do not plan to obtain  key man life insurance on any of our officers 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
our failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
we extend warranties to our customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts often do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we typically cap the amounts our customers can recover for damages 
in addition  we 
table of contents do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
the failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  which in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis  which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell most of our services on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines of up to of the total contract value 
in large scale telecommunications infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liability for late completion fines 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products  or enhancements to our existing products  that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
our future operating results will depend  to a significant extent  upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to introduce new products and services to meet the requirements of our customers in a rapidly developing and evolving market 
if we do not enhance our existing products and services or introduce new successful products and services in a timely manner  our products and services may become obsolete  and our revenues and operating results may suffer 
moreover  unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
we cannot be sure that any of these products or services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor enforcement of intellectual property rights in china 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality arrangements and copyright  trademark  and patent registrations 
we have registered some marks and filed trademark applications for other marks with the united states patent and trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also registered copyrights with the state copyright bureau in china with respect to certain of our software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states 
we have filed some patent applications and have acquired some existing patents in the prc for certain hardware and software products used or developed in our business 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
because the chinese legal system in general and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a portion of our business involves the development and customization of software applications for customers 
we generally retain significant ownership or rights to use and market such software for other customer projects  where possible 
however  our customers sometimes retain co ownership and rights to use the applications  
table of contents processes  and intellectual property so developed 
in some cases  we may have no right or only limited rights to reuse or provide these developments to projects involving other customers 
to the extent that we are unable to negotiate contracts which permit us to reuse source codes and methodologies  or to the extent that we have conflicts with our customers regarding our ability to do so  we may be unable to provide similar solutions to our other customers 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future as we introduce services that require new technology 
there can be no assurance that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which could be substantial 
investors may not be able to enforce judgments entered by united states courts against certain of our officers and directors 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors and executive officers  and certain of our principal shareholders  live outside of the united states  principally in beijing and hong kong 
as a result  you may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the united states  or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund our growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between those two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between those currencies 
because of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
since we report our financial results in us dollars  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the software and services component of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
in july  the people s bank of china  or pboc  raised the value of the renminbi by against the us dollar 
moreover  according to the pboc  the renminbi will no longer be pegged to the us dollar  but instead it 
table of contents will float in a tight band against a basket of foreign currencies 
while we do not believe that this change will have a significant impact on the results of our operations  we cannot guarantee that future changes in exchange rate policy will not affect our business 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  both in the telecommunications market and in the market for it security services and solutions 
in the telecommunications market  our competitors include multinational companies such as amdocs  digital china  huawei  linkage and neusoft 
in the security products and services market  our competitors are mainly local players such as topsec and netscreen and international players such as cisco 
our competitors  many of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than we have  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the people s republic of china in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the mii  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
recently  the chinese government s increased measures to control economic growth have contributed and will continue to contribute to cautious spending by our telecommunications customers 
such measures may also result in the delay of certain large telecommunications related projects  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to investor perceptions of investments relating to china and asia  as well as developments in the telecommunications industry 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 

table of contents if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
in the past  periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  have often been followed by the institution of securities class action litigation against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past  and we are currently involved in this type of litigation as a result of allegedly improper allocation procedures relating to the sale of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in march of for more information on that litigation  please see the discussion under the heading item legal proceedings in part i of this report 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control and prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of our common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  such an issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board to be not less than three nor more than ten directors 
the terms of the office of the seven member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in this classification of the board may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to certain exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder  and an interested stockholder includes any person that owns or more of our outstanding voting stock or that is our affiliate or associate 
our change of control severance agreements with executive officers may discourage a change of control 
we have entered into change of control severance agreements with most of our executive officers 
these agreements provide  among other things  that the executive officers would be entitled to various benefits upon the occurrence of a covered termination as defined therein which occurs within one year after a change of control as defined therein  including payment of one year of base salary and bonus  immediate vesting of of any outstanding unvested stock options held by the executive officer and the provision of medical benefits and housing allowance 
if a change of control occurs  and regardless of whether a covered termination takes place  
table of contents the executive officers may be entitled to accelerated vesting of of any outstanding unvested stock options held by the executive officer 
the potential obligations to pay executive officers such severance amounts may discourage a potential acquiror from effecting a change of control 
we are subject to potential liabilities and anticipate significant increases in expenses in complying with the sarbanes oxley act 
in july  president george w 
bush signed the sarbanes oxley act of  or the act  into law 
among other things  the act imposes corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure requirements  introduces stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committees  and sets stiff penalties for securities fraud 
the act and the related rules and regulations have increased the scope  complexity and costs of our corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices  and may increase the risk of personal liability for our board members  chief executive officer  and chief financial officer 
any such liabilities may adversely affect our reputation  our business  or our ability to meet listing criteria 
section of the act requires our management and our independent auditors to assess our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis 
during the course of this evaluation  documentation and attestation  we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remedy in time to meet the deadline imposed by the act for compliance with the requirements of section if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls  on an ongoing basis  over financial reporting in accordance with the act 
moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
as a result  our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
furthermore  we anticipate that we will incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with section and other requirements of the act 
we are exposed to certain tax risks with respect to tax benefits enjoyed by certain of our subsidiaries 
one of our prc subsidiaries  which was certified as a high and new technology enterprises  has enjoyed a favorable enterprise income tax rate since recently  we have been unofficially notified by local tax authorities regarding the subsidiary s entitlement to this preferential tax rate 
these authorities have suggested that high and new technology enterprises might not qualify for a preferential tax treatment 
we believe that our tax return positions are justifiable  but tax authorities may formally challenge certain positions we have asserted 
the tax positions we have asserted may not be fully sustained and could expose us to litigation  administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities if the relevant tax authorities take a position contrary to ours  and could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if these tax benefits to our subsidiary are no longer available  certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to enterprise income tax as a foreign investment enterprise in china at rates of  which could cause a reduction in our after tax income 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we did not receive any material comments from the sec staff which were received more than days before the end of  regarding our periodic or current reports that remained unresolved at the date hereof 
we have responded to a comment letter from the sec dated december   which contained four questions 
we believe we have responded to the comments in a satisfactory manner but as of the filing of this form k  
table of contents we have neither received a follow up comment letter nor a letter indicating that the sec is satisfied with our responses 
item properties our principal development facilities and administrative offices currently occupy approximately  square meters in a building located in the beijing zhongguancun science park 
the current lease for this facility expires in november in addition  we have regional field support offices in various cities in china  namely shanghai  guangzhou  chengdu  hangzhou  nanjing  nanchang  shenyang and fuzhou  as well as a regional office in santa clara  california 
item legal proceedings on december   a securities class action case was filed in new york city against us  certain of our officers and directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering  or ipo 
the lawsuit alleged violations of the us federal securities laws and was docketed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york as hassan v 
asiainfo holdings  inc  et al 
the lawsuit alleged  among other things  that the underwriters of our ipo improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of their purchasing shares in our ipo 
the lawsuit further claimed that the alleged practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our ipo prospectus and registration statement 
the suit seeks rescission of the plaintiffs alleged purchases of our common stock as well as unspecified damages 
in addition to the case against us  various other plaintiffs have filed approximately  other  substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded companies and their ipo underwriters in new york city  which along with the case against us  have all been transferred to a single federal district judge for purposes of case management 
in june  based on a decision made by a special independent committee of our board  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
on september   after considering the underwriter defendants objections  the court issued an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement with the issuer defendants in all respects 
presently  the proposed settlement is subject to final approval by the court 
the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlement related expenses would come from participating issuers directors and officers liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves 
the proposed settlement also contemplates that we will assign any claims we may have against the underwriters of our ipo for excess commissions to the plaintiffs 
a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer s allocable share of the settlement costs 
we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 
consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon  among other things  negotiating  executing  and filing final settlement documents with the court  and receiving final approval from the court 
if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated  we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
moreover  if the proposed settlement is not consummated  we believe that the underwriters may have an obligation to indemnify us for the legal fees and other costs of defending this suit and that our directors and officers liability insurance policies would also cover the defense and potential exposure in the suit 
while we cannot guarantee the outcome of these proceedings  we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report to a vote of our security holders

any dividends we declare will be paid in us dollars 
as a holding company  our primary source of cash for the payment of dividends is distributions  if any  from our subsidiaries 
our principal operating subsidiaries were established in china and are able to make distributions of profits to us only if they satisfy certain conditions under chinese law  including the satisfaction of tax liabilities  recovery of losses from previous years and mandatory contributions to statutory reserves 
in addition  loan agreements and contractual arrangements we enter into in the future may further restrict our ability to pay dividends 
in november  the board approved a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock  par value us  during a six month period 
in the second quarter of  the board approved the repurchase of an additional  shares under the program  and an extension of the repurchase period to august  during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of high quality telecom software solutions and security products and services to some of china s largest enterprises as well as many small and medium sized companies in china 
an established leader in the chinese telecommunications industry  we became a leading provider of security products and services in china with the acquisition of lenovo s non telecom related it services business in in the telecommunications market  our software and services enable our customers to build  maintain  operate  manage and continuously improve their communications infrastructure 
our largest customers are the major telecommunications carriers in china and their provincial subsidiaries 
in addition to providing customized software solutions to china s telecom carriers  we also offer sophisticated security products and services to many small and medium sized companies in china 
we commenced our operations in the united states in and moved our major operations from the united states to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software revenues in we conduct the bulk of our business through our operating subsidiaries  most of which are chinese companies 
we have derived  and believe that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large telecommunications customers  such as china mobile  china unicom  china telecom and china netcom 
sales to china mobile and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china netcom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china unicom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to china telecom and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
the sum of our top five receivable balances represented and of our total receivable balances for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of our reliance on our key customers in the telecommunications industry  our operating results are influenced by governmental spending policies in that sector 
historically  a number of state mandated restructurings in china s telecommunications sector have led to cancellation or delays in telecommunications related capital expenditure  and have negatively impacted our operating results in certain periods 
ongoing uncertainty in the telecommunications industry  combined with the chinese government s measures to control the over heating of the chinese economy  has contributed and may continue to contribute to cautious spending by our telecommunications customers 
in addition  any future restructurings affecting our major telecommunications customers may result in delays or cancellation of telecommunications related spending  which would likely have an adverse impact on our business 

table of contents on july   we signed a definitive agreement with lenovo group limited to acquire its non telecommunications related information technology services business in a transaction valued at approximately million 
on october   we completed the closing of this acquisition and formed a new division  lenovo asiainfo  to operate the acquired assets  along with our other enterprise information solutions assets 
we also entered into a forward contract to deliver shares of our common stock having an aggregate market value of approximately million at any time during the twelve month period following the closing date of the acquisition 
on july   we settled the forward contract by delivering from treasury stock  shares of our common stock  with a fair market value of million  and paying cash of million to lenovo 
upon settlement of the forward contract  lenovo owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in  the lenovo asiainfo division generated approximately million in revenue  representing more than of our total revenues for the year 
in line with our strategy to focus on our core telecommunication software solutions and security products and services businesses  during  we sold our subsidiary  han management consulting china limited han to han s management team 
we also sold certain assets constituting our e government business unit to pansky technology group pansky  and certain assets constituting our human resources and business intelligence software businesses unit to hinge software co 
ltd 
hinge 
during the fourth quarter of  we strengthened our leading position in the telecom software solutions market through the strategic acquisition of the telecom operation support business group of zheda lande 
we have signed definitive documentation with respect to the acquisition of the telecom operation support business group of changjiang and expect this transaction to close in the first half of since our acquisition of the non telecom it services business of lenovo group limited in october  we have been organized as two business units  asiainfo technologies  encompassing our traditional telecommunications business  and lenovo asiainfo  providing it services  including security products and services to china s enterprise market 
each business unit is further organized into three operating segments by product types software products and solutions  service and third party hardware 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
as our current method of segment reporting only began after acquisition of lenovo  prior years comparative information cannot be reclassified into these two business units 
revenues we report our revenues on the basis of the three principal types of revenues derived from our business software products and solutions revenue  service revenue and third party hardware revenue 
software products and solutions revenue 
we typically sell our software as part of a total solution package for our customers  which includes proprietary software licenses  professional services related to the design and implementation of the solution such as consulting  training  technical support and maintenance and  in cases where the customer requests a turn key solution  related hardware 
software products and solutions revenue includes two types of revenues software license revenue and software services revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees received from customers for licenses or sublicenses to use our software products or third party software products in perpetuity  typically up to a specified maximum number of users 
in most cases where a customer is required to purchase additional licenses from us because the number of users exceeds the number of licensed users  we enter into an extension agreement with the customer to expand and upgrade the customer s system 
these extension contracts will usually include a license for the additional users  updated versions of our software and  if required  additional services and hardware for the customer s network 
our software license revenue also includes the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which reflect the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
software services revenue consists of revenue from software installation  customization  training and other services 
we also record reductions from revenue for our estimates of expected software sales returns from distributors based on current sales and historical return sales

service revenue consists of revenue from professional services  including it services  management consulting  and revenues for network planning  design  systems integration and training 
third party hardware revenue 
third party hardware revenue consists of hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors 
we procure for  and sell hardware to  our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we typically minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against letters of credit from our customers 
as the telecommunications related it services market in china develops  our customers are increasingly purchasing hardware directly from hardware vendors and hiring us for our software and professional services 
net revenue 
although we report our revenue on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  or net revenues  which is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers with high value it professional services and  where efficient  outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenue as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenue net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown on this basis and reconciles our net revenues to our total revenues years ended december  asiainfo technologies lenovo asiainfo total asiainfo technologies lenovo asiainfo total total total total amounts in thousands of us revenues net of hardware costs software products and solutions revenue service revenue third party hardware revenue net of hardware costs total revenues net of hardware costs total hardware costs total revenues we believe total revenues net of hardware costs in each of the segments of our business more accurately reflects our core business  which is the provision of software solutions and services  and provides transparency to our investors 
we believe this measure provides transparency to our investors because it is the measure used by our management to evaluate the competitiveness and development of our business in each of the segments 
in addition  third party hardware revenue tends to fluctuate from period to period depending on the requirements of our customers 
as a result  a presentation that excludes hardware costs allows investors to better evaluate the performance of our core business 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed financial information regarding segment reporting and a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure  total revenues 
we have evaluated the criteria outlined in eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate under us gaap to record the gross amount of revenues and related costs or the net amount earned after deducting hardware costs paid to the supplier 
we record the gross amounts billed to our customers because we are the primary obligor in these transactions  bear the inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices  are involved in the determination of the product specifications  bear credit risk and have the right to select suppliers 
cost of revenues software products and solutions costs 
software products and solutions costs consist primarily of three components packaging and written manual expenses for our proprietary software products and solutions  
table of contents compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in modifying  customizing or installing our software products and solutions and in providing consultation  training and support services  and software license fees paid to third party software providers for the right to sublicense their products to our customers as part of our solutions offerings 
the costs associated with designing and modifying our proprietary software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
service costs 
service costs consist primarily of compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in designing and implementing it services  management consulting and network solutions projects 
service costs also include hardware warranty costs 
we accrue hardware warranty costs upon final acceptance 
we typically obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
our estimates of warranty cost are based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
third party hardware costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in large projects we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and amortization expenses for intangible assets 
compensation expenses consistently comprise a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include compensation expenses for employees in our sales and marketing departments  third party advertising expenses  as well as sales commissions and sales agency fees 
research and development expenses relate to the development of new software and the modification of existing software 
we expense such costs as they are incurred 
taxes except for certain hardware procurement and resale transactions  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese subsidiaries  which are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
under the income tax laws of china  foreign invested enterprises  or fies  satisfying certain criteria can enjoy preferential tax treatment 
several of our operating subsidiaries are fies and enjoy certain preferential tax treatments in china 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for details of the preferential tax treatment for these subsidiaries 
the unified chinese corporate income tax laws for domestic enterprises and fies might take effect in we anticipate that these unified tax laws will eliminate various preferential tax provisions in china 
however  such unified tax laws should not affect the preferential tax treatments granted to fies in previous years 
sales of hardware procured in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our sales of hardware procured outside of china are made through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass value added taxes on hardware sales through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
companies that develop their own 
table of contents software and register the software with the relevant authorities in china are generally entitled to a value added tax refund 
if the net amount of the value added tax payable exceeds of software sales and software related services  the excess portion of the value added tax is refundable immediately 
this policy is effective until we are also subject to us income taxes on revenues generated in the united states  including revenues from our limited hardware procurement activities through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  and interest income earned in the united states 
foreign exchange a majority of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the software and service components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or other business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce our foreign exchange risks 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash from us dollars to renminbi in order to address concerns regarding a possible increase in the relative value of the renminbi 
we did not engage in any significant foreign exchange transactions in pursuant to the rate of exchange quoted by china s central bank  as of december  the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar decreased to us rmb  compared to the rate of us rmb as of december  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues and cost of revenues under customer contracts  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  goodwill and other intangible assets  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from customer orders requiring significant production  modifications  or customization of the software are recognized over the installation and customization period based on the percentage of completion method as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts sop 
labor costs and direct project expenses are used to determine the stage of completion  except for revenues associated with the procurement of hardware 
such hardware related revenues are recognized upon delivery 
estimates of hardware warranty costs are included in determining project costs 
on contracts that do not involve significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our product  license fees through both direct or reseller arrangements is recorded when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee that is probable of collection and when the related products are shipped and or installed as prescribed by sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
sop 
for consulting and other professional services sales  we recognize our service revenue as such services are performed or ratably over the contractual period and recognize the costs associated with these contracts as incurred 

table of contents we also record reductions from revenue for our estimates of expected software sales returns from distributors based on current sales and historical return sales 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to adjustments in current periods as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  revenue will be recognized upon completion 
for contracts with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
revenue is deferred for the fair value of any undelivered elements and recognized for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if the only undelivered element is post contract support pcs for which we have established vsoe  we recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for pcs as revenue upon delivery 
the pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
if the costs related to pcs are insignificant and for a period of up to one year  which include telephone support  we accrue the costs at the time the revenue is recorded 
revenue in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled receivables and amounts billed but not yet collected are recorded as billed receivables 
billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made in the period in which the anticipated losses become known 
actual costs and gross margins on such contracts could differ from management s estimates and those differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  our estimates for costs and gross margins have not differed significantly from actual costs and gross margins 
however  any material deviation of such costs and gross margins from our estimates would impact our future operating results 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill 
beginning in  with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment upon first adoption and annually thereafter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we use a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and recognize a goodwill impairment loss in the statement of operations when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we perform all goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
the latest goodwill impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarter of and an amount of million in impairment losses was recognized 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in  from million in software revenue was million  representing a increase from million in service revenue was million  representing a decrease from million in the decrease in our total revenues was primarily attributable to a reduction in hardware sales in favor of our higher margin software business 
the increase in software revenues was partially attributable to the organic growth of our telecom business division as well as our acquisition of lenovo s it services business in late the lenovo asiainfo business unit s full year results contributed of our total revenue in lenovo asiainfo made only a nominal contribution to our revenues for the fourth quarter due to the significantly lower shipment volume for our security products in the fourth quarter of the year 
during the fourth quarter  we 
table of contents also experienced a higher than expected volume of product returns in the security business  and made a special provision for product returns  which reduced revenues by approximately million 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues was million in  representing a decrease from million in  primarily due to decreased hardware orders  partially offset by the increased cost of software and services provided to meet increased demand 
at the end of  we recorded an approximately million specific provision in cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of certain it security inventory products to their estimated market values

gross profit increased in to million 
gross margins were versus last year s  as we continued to focus on our high margin software business and to reduce hardware passthrough 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased to million in  from million in our higher overall operating expenses in resulted primarily from the million charge we recognized in for impairment to goodwill and other acquired intangibles due to the disappointing performance of the lenovo asiainfo business unit during the fourth quarter of the impairment loss was determined based on its expected future operating results and cash flows 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to sales and marketing expenses of million from our lenovo asiainfo division as compared to million in general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in  partially as a result of an increase in the specific provisions for accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of the provision was primarily due to anticipated difficulties in the collection of receivables resulting from the unexpectedly high number of resignations from lenovo asiainfo s sales force which hampered communication with customers 
research and development expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in as we continued to enhance investment in our value added services business unit and core telecom software solutions 
impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of million  relating to our lenovo asiainfo business unit was recorded in the fourth quarter of a decrease in revenue in lenovo asiainfo s business unit in the fourth quarter significantly affected the carrying value of lenovo asiainfo 
the impairment charge was determined by our independent appraisers based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of lenovo asiainfo 
net income loss from continuing operations 
our net loss from continuing operations was million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  as compared to net income of million in  or earnings of per share on a fully diluted basis 
net loss from discontinued operations 
in line with our strategy of focusing on high margin core business lines  we discontinued certain non core businesses  including our han management consulting  enterprise information systems and e government businesses 
due to the disposal of these discontinued operations  we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations for the year of million  or per basic share 
this compares to a net loss from discontinued operations of million or per basic share in net income loss

gross profit 
gross profit increased in to million 
gross profit as a percentage of gross revenues  or gross margin  increased to in  as compared to in the increase in gross margin was attributable to the favorable shift out of hardware sales  the growth in software revenue  and the resulting increase in the contribution of software revenue to total revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  as compared to in operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in  from million in our relatively lower overall operating expenses in resulted primarily because of the million charge we recognized in for goodwill impairment

liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are primarily working capital requirements related to hardware sales and costs associated with the expansion of our business  such as research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
with respect to our billing cycle  we generally require our customers to pay to of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
however  we sometimes obtain less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
in addition to this careful management of our billing cycle  we have also historically financed working capital and other financing requirements through private placements of equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
our full year net operating cash flow in was million dollars driven by operating profit from our telecom business 
despite our positive operating cash flow  our cash position including cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments decreased to million as of december  as compared to million as of december  this was mainly due to the share repurchase program carried out during our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
in the fourth quarter of we made a special provision for accounts receivable in our lenovo asiainfo division 
our billed receivables are recorded based on agreed milestones included in customer contracts 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
as of december   our days sales outstanding were days  as compared to days at the end of the year our inventory position at the end of was approximately million  down as compared to the beginning of the year 
this decrease was in line with our strategy of focusing on high margin software products and services and downsizing our third party hardware sales 
in the fourth quarter of we made a special provision for inventory obsolescence in our lenovo asiainfo division 
as of december   we had total short term credit facilities for working capital purposes totaling million  expiring by december the facilities were secured by bank deposits of million as of december  at december   unused short term credit facilities were million and used facilities totaled million 
the used facilities were pledged as security for issuing standby letters of credit and notes payable to hardware suppliers and customers 
additional bank deposits of million were used for issuing standby letters of credit and bank acceptance drafts as of december  bank deposits pledged as security for these credit facilities totaled million as of december  and are presented as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we were committed under certain operating leases  requiring annual minimum rentals of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
we anticipate that we would raise additional funds  if necessary  through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 
in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our stockholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements with any individuals or entities

for information concerning certain risks that may affect our operating results and the value of our common stock  please see item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our cash  short term investments and short term bank loans 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes 

table of contents we are exposed to exchange rate risk in connection with the relative value of the us dollar and the renminbi 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service and software components of our business are denominated in renminbi 
as of december   the rate of exchange quoted by the people s bank of china was us rmb 
if the exchange rate were to increase by to us rmb  our net assets would potentially decrease by  if the exchange rate were to decrease by to us rmb  our net assets would potentially increase by  to reduce currency risk related to the renminbi  we maintain a significant portion of our cash deposits in us dollars  and we have used such deposits to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
the value of our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  an increase in the value of the renminbi may require us to exchange more us dollars into renminbi to meet the working capital requirements of our subsidiaries in china 
depreciation of the value of the us dollar will also reduce the value of the cash we hold in us dollars  which we may use for purposes of future acquisitions or business expansion 
we actively monitor our exposure to these risks and adjust our cash position in the renminbi and the us dollar when we believe such adjustments will reduce our foreign exchange risk 
for example  in february we exchanged approximately million cash in us dollars into renminbi 
we did not engage in any significant foreign exchange transactions in there have been no significant changes in our exposure to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  our exposure to interest rate changes is limited as we do not have any borrowings 
we are subject to variable interest rates on our bank deposits that are short term investments 
as there are no significant market price movements  such investments are held at cost 
as in any other business  we are subject to the risk of macroeconomic changes such as recessions and inflation
