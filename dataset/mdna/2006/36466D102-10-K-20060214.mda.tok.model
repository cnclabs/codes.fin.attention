item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item a  risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic player terminals and bingo systems 
we currently market portable systems that can be played anywhere within a bingo hall and fixed base systems with touchscreen activated monitors 
for our three most recent fiscal years ended october    and  our portable terminals generated approximately   and of our revenue  respectively  while  during those same years  our fixed base terminals generated the balance of our revenue 
as of october   we had systems in service in states and in five foreign countries 
we generate revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  and our ability to expand operations into new markets and our ability to increase our market share 
fixed base bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
for fiscal year and fiscal year  costs of  and  were capitalized respectively  and are amortized over the expected term of the contract 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over either a three or five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our expenses consist primarily of a cost of revenue  consisting of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  depreciation and amortization of bingo terminals  repair  refurbishment  and disposals of bingo terminals and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence allowance  b general and administrative  consisting of activities associated with management of our company and related support  which includes finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  and accounts receivable reserve  c sales and marketing  consisting primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products and an internal sales force with a focus upon generating new customers and upgrades for existing customers  and d research and development  consisting of company sponsored research and development activities to provide players with new or enhanced products on which to play electronic bingo 
fiscal highlights during fiscal  despite a million decrease in revenue  we returned to a position of profitability as a result of various factors  including the following our ability to decrease our cost of revenue as a percentage of sales to during from during  a million reduction in research and development expenses as a result of reduced and more focused project costs  million of loss contingencies and million impairment of goodwill  both of which were incurred during fiscal and immaterial comparable amounts were included in fiscal results  other reductions in general administrative expenses  which were offset by million of severance related expenses as a result of management changes and staff reductions during fiscal and elevated levels of legal expenses 

table of contents in addition  we have continued to incur expenses in aggressively defending or pursuing certain legal issues  including those disclosed under item  legal proceedings 
these costs were million for both fiscal year and fiscal year during fiscal  our capital expenditures decreased approximately  or million to million  from million during fiscal  primarily related to the purchase of bingo systems and related support equipment 
the decrease is primarily related to a change in our product shift from fixed base systems to our traveler terminals which have a lower cost per terminal to produce 
transactions resulting in stock compensation expense in december  the vesting period for  employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock was accelerated and became fully vested 
as a result of this stock option modification  we recorded compensation expense of  for the quarter ended january  the stock compensation expense was calculated using the intrinsic value method  which compares the common stock option exercise price to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of modification 
the stock compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
in january  the term for  options of a former employee to purchase shares of our common stock was extended for an additional six months and vesting was accelerated as the result of an executed consulting agreement 
as a result of this six month consulting agreement to assist us in various legal matters and resulting stock option modification  we recorded compensation expense of  for the quarter ended january  the stock options are subject to measurement under financial accounting standards fas and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf 
fas set forth the requirements with respect to accounting for transactions involving a company s stock that is issued in exchange for goods or services 
according to fas  these transactions should be measured at the fair value of the equity issued 
in accordance with eitf  compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the option at the date the performance commitment is reached 
we have determined that the performance commitment was reached upon the effective date of the consulting agreement that occurred january  the fair value of the stock options was measured at that date based on the black scholes model using a fas approach 
per eitf  a recognized expense should not be reversed even if the option expires unexercised 
the stock compensation expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
on august  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under its incentive stock plan 
as a result of this action  options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock became exercisable as of that date 
of these options  approximately  were out of the money at the time of the accelerated vesting 
the remaining  options resulted in stock compensation expense of  the stock compensation expense was calculated using the intrinsic value method  which compares the common stock option exercise price to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of modification 
this stock compensation expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in the future consolidated financial statements upon our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment beginning in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue 
table of contents recognition  bad debts  bingo terminal depreciation  goodwill impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for bingo terminals and bingo systems installed as a single element placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
our revenue recognition is a key component of our results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo terminals  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and therefore in our determination of whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
our reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo terminal demand for placement into halls 
our estimates of future bingo terminal demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete bingo terminals 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals and our reported operating results 
software development capitalization we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products that meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we are capitalizing qualified costs of software developed for new products or for significant enhancements to existing products 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
we amortize the costs on a straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release 
the achievement of technological feasibility and the estimate of a products economic life require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of our accounts receivable based on aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of our receivables  payment trends  
table of contents and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment review  and depending upon the results of that measurement  the recorded goodwill may be written down and charged to income from operations when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
the review for fiscal was completed as of july  the valuation date  and we determined there is no impairment of goodwill as of that date 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates reduced profitability associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
all of these assessments require management judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
internal control over accounting for taxes we have identified a significant deficiency in our accounting for income taxes as described herein 
in preparing our tax provision for fiscal  we identified certain adjustments to our tax liability accounts and related income tax provision 
this significant deficiency constitutes a material weakness in that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement could have occurred and would not be prevented or detected by our internal control on a timely basis 
all adjustments to correct this matter have been reflected in our financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended october  
table of contents we have taken corrective actions aimed at the timely calculation of the provision for income taxes 
our remediation efforts included engaging an independent public accounting firm to assist in the tax reconciliation and evaluation process  and we have increased the skill and experience level of senior management  including the establishment of an internal audit department 
in addition  we are developing definitive procedures for the detailed documentation and reconciliations supporting the income taxes payable  deferred income tax and tax provision balances and amounts  including the appropriate review and approval of related journal entries 
upon the complete implementation of the above measures  we will have significantly improved our previous internal control and reduced to a lesser likelihood the possibility of a misstatement that would not be prevented or detected 
we have therefore concluded that appropriate steps have been taken or are in process  to mitigate the above deficiency 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of operations data for our company expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended october  statements of operations data net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development loss contingency impairment of goodwill total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  to million compared to revenue of million in fiscal the decrease in revenue for fiscal is a result of several factors including the impact of the loss of certain customer accounts in the fourth quarter of  unfavorable legislative changes in the state of oklahoma that allowed more profitable slot machine style gaming over bingo  and decreased revenue in certain states 
these unfavorable changes were offset in part by increased expansion in canada and the united kingdom  increased revenue in texas  michigan  and other key states and the continued popularity and rollout of our traveler terminals 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was compared to for fiscal key components of our cost of revenue include  among other items  expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  
table of contents depreciation and amortization of bingo terminals  repair  refurbishment  and disposals of bingo terminals and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence allowance 
cost reductions were effected by reductions in service and operations personnel  increased efficiencies in our refurbishments  and reductions in travel related costs 
bingo equipment depreciation and amortization of related intangibles for fiscal decreased by approximately  below fiscal  primarily as the increased depreciation as a result of our investment in traveler terminals is offset by our older terminals becoming fully depreciated 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were compared to for fiscal fiscal and fiscal included elevated levels of legal expenses  including those related to litigation with a former distributor in texas  a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  litigation with a former distributor of igs in mississippi  and other legal proceedings 
in addition  fiscal included legal expenses associated with a notice of opportunity to show compliance in texas 
other increases in general and administrative expenses include a severance agreement with our former ceo  a settlement with the texas lottery commission  and increased accounting fees due to increased compliance reviews associated with the sarbanes oxley act of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were compared to for fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs for our internal sales force 
distributor commissions decreased million to million or of revenue for fiscal compared to of revenue for fiscal costs associated with our internal sales force grew by  as a result of an increase in severance costs and increases in marketing  and other business promotion costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were compared to for fiscal the cost reductions were accomplished with reductions in personnel and employee related costs  including employee severance costs  and reduced  but more focused  project costs 
during fiscal and fiscal we capitalized internally developed software costs of approximately  and  respectively  of payroll related costs  from our research and development and software quality assurance functions  that meets technological feasibility and recoverability tests in accordance with fasb statement no 
loss contingencies 
loss contingencies decreased million  or to  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal loss contingencies for consisted of an additional award of  for legal fees and expenses and costs and  for interest accrued on a legal judgement 
loss contingencies for consisted of million for a legal judgment and related legal fees and expenses and costs of  impairment of goodwill 
we recorded no expense for impairment of goodwill in compared to an expense of million recorded in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rate reflects certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting and the effect of state and federal income taxes and nondeductible expenses including goodwill impairment in fiscal on the pre tax income in fiscal versus pre tax loss in fiscal in addition  fiscal included a credit of  due to an adjustment in income tax liabilities 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue 
we generated revenue of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease of approximately  or  was a result of several factors  including fewer installed terminals and price erosion as a result of increased competition in the southern and western 
table of contents markets 
we believe the introduction of feature enhancements to existing products and the availability of new products will provide for future revenue growth 
however  it is difficult for us to predict the time required to move newly developed features and products through beta testing and regulatory approvals  where required 
our newest portable color terminal  the traveler  began with limited nationwide rollout in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal with favorable results 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was compared to for fiscal key components of our cost of revenue include  among other items  depreciation of bingo equipment and service and operations expenses 
bingo equipment depreciation and amortization of related intangibles increased by approximately million over fiscal  primarily due to our investment in traveler portable color terminals  ted c portable color terminals  and our fixed base terminals  and operations expense increased  principally due to employee severance costs and increased shipping costs 
additionally  costs associated with the obsolete bingo terminals  repair  refurbishment and disposal of bingo terminals and related support equipment increased  a increase  from the prior year  relating primarily to monitor disposals and the disposal of the first generation traveler terminals which were technologically obsolete 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a  decrease 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue for the current year were compared to for fiscal fiscal and fiscal included elevated levels of legal expenses  including those related to defense of litigation with a former distributor in texas  a patent infringement lawsuit in nevada  litigation with a former distributor of igs in mississippi  and other legal proceedings including our litigation against a former distributor in virginia and kentucky and a virginia sub distributor in late the improvement in general and administrative costs came as a result of a decrease of  in consulting fees and a decrease in non litigation outside legal fees of  partially offset with increases of  in severance expense and outside accounting fees of  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing increased approximately  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal sales and marketing includes distributor commissions and personnel  travel  promotional  and support costs for our internal sales force 
distributor commissions increased  to million due to an increased percentage of revenues generated by distributors 
costs associated with our internal sales force grew by  as a result of an increase in severance costs of  and increases in non payroll costs such as travel  marketing  and facilities 
research and development 
research and development costs increased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal research and development costs as a percentage of revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the engineering staff 
employee severance costs in october were  the traveler terminal  that began beta testing in december and commenced limited nationwide rollout in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal  is the positive results of our efforts 
the emphasis on new product development and feature enhancements for existing products continues as a major focus 
during fiscal we capitalized internally developed software 
we capitalized approximately  of payroll related costs  from our research and development and software quality assurance functions  connected with the internal development of software that meets technological feasibility and recoverability tests in accordance with fasb statement no 
we had no such capitalized costs in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately and for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
the change in effective tax rate reflects certain permanent differences between financial accounting and tax accounting and the effect of state and federal income taxes and nondeductible expenses including goodwill impairment on the pre tax loss in fiscal versus pre tax income in the prior year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the million consisted primarily of net income of million  adjusted positively by million for depreciation  amortization  obsolescence  and loss on disposal of bingo terminals and related equipment provisions  less a net use of funds of million from changes in other operating assets and liabilities including million used to purchase two restricted short term investments related to the trend litigation issue 
during fiscal  the million consisted primarily of net loss of million  adjusted positively by million for depreciation  amortization  and obsolescence provisions  provision for the trend loss contingency of million  impairment of goodwill of million  and a net change of  in deferred taxes and other operating assets and liabilities 
we used approximately million of cash in investing activities during fiscal compared to million of cash used during fiscal the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo terminals and associated support equipment  the purchase and development of software and other intangible assets for a total of  and a decrease in short term investments of million 
the decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to reduced purchases of bingo terminals and associated support equipment due to changes in our product shift from fixed base systems to our traveler terminals which have a lower cost per terminal to produce 
during fiscal  the million consisted of million of capital expenditures million of which was expended on bingo terminals and associated support equipment  the purchase and development of software and other intangible assets for a total of million  and an increase in short term investments of  financing activities used  during fiscal compared to the cash used of million during fiscal the  used during fiscal was for cash dividends of  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  during fiscal  the million used was primarily for cash dividends of million and payments of  on long term debt  offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of  as of october   we had cash  cash equivalents  and unrestricted short term investments of approximately million 
in addition to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  we have a million line of credit with wells fargo bank  na  which has an interest rate based on the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus  at our option  on which there was no outstanding balance at october  the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require that specified financial balances and ratios be maintained  requires profitability to be maintained on a quarterly basis  and restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness and payment of dividends 
in addition  our aggregate of cash and readily marketable securities must at all times exceed multiplied by the amount of the line of credit 
the revolving credit facility expires on april  no assurance can be made for renewal on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to support our operations  provide for budgeted capital expenditures  and meet liquidity requirements through the remainder of fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business  and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  strategic opportunities we may pursue could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital calls or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if it is available  it will be on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents information on contractual obligations held as of october  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase bingo terminals and support equipment at fixed prices and or guaranteed quantities 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into such an agreement with one of our vendors to provide approximately million in traveler terminals 
as of october    of the commitment was outstanding and all purchases are expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into two additional agreements with the same vendor to provide an additional million in traveler terminals 
all of this commitment was outstanding as of october  and all purchases are expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into two additional purchase commitments from the same vendor to provide approximately million in traveler terminals 
all purchases are expected to occur in fiscal inflation and general economic condition although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain an investment portfolio  of approximately  in available for sale debt securities of the us government and its agencies  and in investment grade corporate issues 
the values of these investments are subject to changes in interest rates 
however  because these investments are short term and are generally allowed to mature  we do not believe that any risk inherent in our portfolio is likely to have a material effect on expected cash flows 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
our revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require that specified financial balances and ratios be maintained  requires profitability to be maintained on a quarterly basis  and restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness and payment of dividends 
in addition  our aggregate of cash and readily marketable securities must at all times exceed multiplied by the amount of the line of credit 
the line of credit expires on april  no assurance can be made for renewal 
because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
we do not believe  however  that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on our interest expense or available cash 
we currently maintain a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 

table of contents sensitivity analysis market risks 
assuming we had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
we do not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow or our results of operations
