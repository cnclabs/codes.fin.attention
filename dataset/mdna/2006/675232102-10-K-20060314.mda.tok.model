all statements in this form k  other than statements of historical facts  including  without limitation  statements regarding our business strategy  plans for future operations and industry conditions  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the heading cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 

table of contents executive overview we generate over of our revenue from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  we increased revenue by  led by our rov up  subsea products up and subsea projects up segments 
the rov segment increase was primarily a result of increased utilization and rates  and a larger average work class fleet size 
our subsea products segment revenue increased from sales of specialty products  including clamps from our grayloc products division  which we acquired at the end of june our subsea projects vessel utilization increased to from in  and we also spot chartered three vessels and a barge from which we provided services 
the increased subsea projects demand was a result of services needed after hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita 
the million net income we earned in was the highest in our history 
the million increase in results was attributable to higher profit contributions from all of our oilfield operating segments and equity income from medusa spar llc 
in  we completed the following acquisitions and major capital investments acquisition of grayloc products  llc and subsidiary together  grayloc  and addition of work class rovs  including three acquired from mtq corporation limited  while retiring nine older rovs 
for  we expect improved results from all of our oilfield segments  with the exception of mobile offshore production systems  as  under the terms of the customer s renewal option  the dayrate for the ocean legend will decrease in may we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility operation and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs are usually used to provide drill support services 
therefore  utilization of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rig use and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs in use rov utilization we believe that growth in our subsea products segment will be driven by a rise in the use of subsea completions 
historically  there has been a strong correlation between the number of annual subsea tree orders and the follow on of orders for umbilicals 
the following table shows industry data and projections for worldwide subsea completion installations by decade 
number of subsea period completions s s s s s industry projection publicly available industry baseline estimates project the global market for subsea tree orders in to be over trees  up from trees in industry wide umbilical orders in are expected to increase to around  kilometers  up from approximately  kilometers in 
table of contents according to quest offshore resources  inc  the worldwide market for steel tube umbilicals is expected to grow by kilometers  or  led by growth in west africa 
demand in the gulf of mexico gom is forecast to continue at the record pace of approximately kilometers set in the gom outlook is for a larger number of orders  as about one third of the gom market in was associated with one project 
with the expected march start up of a steel tube manufacturing line in our panama city  fl umbilical plant  we should be well positioned to secure a significant part of this work 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize our billings under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products and advanced technologies segments  and occasionally in our subsea projects segment  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue as we deliver the goods and services and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets fair values  which are generally based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets  or fair market value of the assets  to the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment is recorded as the amount  if any  by which the carrying amounts exceed the fair values 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 

table of contents in  we recorded million of impairments as additional depreciation in our rov segment 
these provisions related to the retirement of four vehicles and obsolete rov components 
in  our owned cable lay and maintenance joint venture recorded an impairment of million related to some of its equipment 
we also recorded an additional impairment of million of our investment 
after taking into account a deferred gain of million we had generated upon formation of the venture  the two impairments reduced our equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates by million in we expense the costs of repair and maintenance as we incur them  except for drydocking costs associated with our larger vessels 
we estimate and accrue these drydocking costs over a period of time in advance of future drydockings 
these amounts are included in accrued liabilities on our balance sheets 
we recognize differences between the estimates and actual costs incurred in the income statement 
loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review each claim with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in  we recorded a million reduction of income tax expense resulting from the resolution of tax contingencies related to certain foreign tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
currently payable income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded

liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in january at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
we expect our operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service  for the foreseeable future 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisition of grayloc for million and additions to our rov fleet to replace older units we retired and to increase the number of units 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisitions of work class rovs from stolt offshore sa and work class rovs from fugro sa these two acquisitions totaled million 
our other capital expenditures in included million to upgrade our umbilical plants in the us and brazil  other additions to our rov fleet to replace older units we retired and a new diving vessel 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisitions of ois international inspection plc  nauticos corporation  reflange  inc and rotator as 
these acquisitions totaled million 
our other capital expenditures in included additions to our fleet of rovs to replace older units we retired  the start of costs to upgrade our umbilical plants in the us and brazil  and vessel upgrades 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a million aggregate purchase price limitation 
under this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock through the year ended december   at a total cost of million 
through december   we had reissued all of these shares as contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options under our incentive plans 
for a description of our incentive plans  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in december  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
at formation  medusa spar llc borrowed million  or approximately of its total capitalization  from a group of banks 
the balance of the bank loan at december  was million 
the bank loan is secured by minimum throughput guarantees by the other investors in medusa spar llc 
we expect the minimum throughput guarantees will generate sufficient revenue for medusa spar llc to repay the bank loan 
we are under no obligation to provide medusa spar llc or the banks with additional funds to repay the loan 
the majority of the cash flow generated by medusa spar llc will be used to repay the bank loan until the loan is retired 
after that  the cash flow from medusa spar llc will be available for distribution to the equity holders 
we received million and million of cash distributions from medusa spar llc and recognized million and million of equity in the earnings of medusa spar llc in and  respectively 
medusa spar llc is a variable interest entity under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r fin no 
r 
as we are not the primary beneficiary of medusa spar llc  we are accounting for our investment in medusa spar llc using the equity method of accounting 
at december   our investment in medusa spar llc was million 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income  adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock compensation under our restricted stock plan 
in and  we received million and million  respectively  in cash flow from financing activities as proceeds from the sale of our common stock  primarily pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
in  our million of cash provided from operating activities was net of million of increases in accounts receivable and million of increases in inventory and other current assets 
the increases in accounts receivable is due to an increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the increases in inventory and other current assets principally related to rov spare parts and raw materials 
the increase in rov parts inventory partially related to equipment waiting for assembly into rovs to be placed in service in the raw materials related to preparations for building items reflected in our subsea products backlog  which increased nearly over the level at december  in  our accounts receivable increased by million 
when we purchased the rovs and related business operations from stolt offshore sa and fugro nv in  we did not acquire any related accounts receivable 
therefore  as we accumulated revenue from our operations of the rovs  our associated accounts receivable increased 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million related to business acquisitions  primarily grayloc  and million to modernize and add additional units and equipment to our rov business 
in  we used million in our investing activities  attributable to the business acquisitions and capital expenditures mentioned above 
we used million in in investing activities  in large part attributable to business acquisitions and our investment in medusa spar llc 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries

these new 
table of contents vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths to  feet and in severe weather conditions 
we have added over of these rovs to our fleet since that time 
we added rovs in while retiring nine older units 
we plan to add at least more rovs in for  our rov revenue increased over from higher utilization percentage  a higher number of units available and higher dayrates 
margin percentages remained flat  as we incurred million of writeoffs associated with the retirement of four older rovs and obsolete rov components 
for  our rov revenue was higher than in gross margin increased 
these increases resulted primarily from the acquisition of work class rovs during in february and in september 
we anticipate rov utilization and margins to increase in as we are increasing our rov fleet size to service demand for the support of construction and production maintenance on the growing number of deepwater field developments and additional rovs providing drill support on floating drilling rigs 
our subsea products revenue in was higher than in  while gross margin and operating income percentages were relatively flat 
we achieved higher sales of our specialty hardware  particularly from sales of rov tooling  installation workover and control systems  valves and clamps 
the clamps are associated with our acquisition of grayloc at the end of june our subsea products revenue in was higher than in  while gross margin and operating income increased and  respectively 
we achieved greater profit contributions from our specialty products  particularly from sales of valves and rov related tooling and product rentals 
for  our subsea products revenue  margins and gross margin percentages were down due to lower activity at our umbilical plants in the uk and brazil 
in  our subsea products gross margin was favorably impacted by million due to the successful completion and resolution of issues related to several projects  including a related insurance claim  on a more favorable basis than we had previously anticipated 
in  margins were unfavorably impacted by our accrual of  of personnel severance costs associated with the move of our us umbilical plant to panama city  florida 
we anticipate improved results from our subsea products segment in  driven by a continuation of a high level of subsea completion activity  which we expect will result in an improvement in our umbilical sales  a general increase in our specialty hardware sales  including a full year of clamp sales from grayloc 
our subsea products backlog increased to million at december  from million at december  our mobile offshore production systems results were fairly consistent for the three periods presented as our three major units continued to work under the same contracts 
we anticipate our mobile offshore production systems operations in to decline from as a result of a lower dayrate going into effect in mid may for the use of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
in  our subsea projects segment had better results than due to a continuation of inspection and repair work necessitated by hurricane ivan and additional inspection and repair work necessitated by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during the year  our vessel utilization increased to over the we attained in in addition  we spot chartered three vessels and a barge from which we provided services 
our subsea projects results were slightly lower in as compared to on slightly higher revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  we had increased demand for our manned diving and vessel based project inspection and repair services due to hurricane ivan and subsea infrastructure needs 
margins in were favorably impacted by reduction in cost estimates of million due to the favorable completion of an installation project and the settlement of a personal injury claim 
in  we expect our subsea projects segment to have improved results over due to a continuation of inspection and repair work necessitated by the hurricanes into and a general escalation in deepwater infrastructure inspection  
table of contents repair and maintenance activities 
in  we will add a saturation diving system and transfer our vessel  the performer  from our advanced technologies segment 
for  our inspection revenue and margins increased over we were able to sell more value added services and raise our margin percentages in  after we incurred expenses in to close and relocate offices as part of our effort to increase operating efficiencies after our purchase of ois international inspection plc in for  our inspection revenue increased and gross margin was comparable to that achieved in however  operating income declined as we incurred the previously mentioned expenses to close and relocate offices 
we expect that our margin percentages in our inspection segment will improve in  as we continue to secure work with higher profit margins  rationalize less profitable operations and realize consolidation savings 
advanced technologies 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for this segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies revenue  gross margin and operating margin for decreased from  due to lower demand from the navy for waterfront facility work and general engineering services and a reduction of deepwater search and recovery projects 
we also incurred expenses in relocating our maryland office 
our advanced technologies revenue  gross margin and operating margin for increased over  largely due to an increase in space related work for nasa s return to flight of the space shuttle program 
this segment s results were adversely affected by a  charge as a result of settling a lawsuit against us for a higher amount than we had anticipated and previously accrued 
we anticipate our advanced technologies results will be slightly lower than due to the transfer of the performer to our subsea projects segment 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock

during and  additional wells were connected to the facility  thereby raising throughput over the level 
in  we expect an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from our investment in medusa spar llc as the production throughput was interrupted in for approximately three months due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
due to the condition of the telecommunications market  our cable lay and maintenance venture is currently inactive and the single vessel used in the venture has been marketed for oilfield and other uses since in  we recognized million of pre tax impairments related to the venture

due to the current shortage of these specialized materials caused by a general worldwide increase in demand for steel  the lead times between placing the order and delivery have become extended 
we have contracts to build umbilicals that will use over of the orders 
we also have other identified opportunities that could utilize these materials 
however  should we decide not to accept delivery of the steel tubes  we would incur cancellation charges of at least of the amount canceled 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts for the years ended december   and  respectively 
positive adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of various foreign currencies against the us dollar for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  negative adjustments reflect the effect of a strengthening dollar 
we recorded foreign currency income losses of million  million and million in our income statements in  and  respectively  related to our foreign operations 
in  the majority of our foreign currency losses related to our uk operations and  in  the majority of our foreign currency losses related to our brazil operations 
some of our uk subsidiary s revenue is from uk dollar denominated contracts 
if the us dollar weakens against the british pound sterling  we will incur currency losses for the period the related accounts receivable are outstanding 
our subsea products business in brazil conducts much of its operations in us dollars  which is its functional currency
