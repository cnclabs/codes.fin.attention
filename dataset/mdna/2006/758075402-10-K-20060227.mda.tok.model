item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary and outlook our primary source of revenue is interest income paid to us from the securities and loans we own  which in turn consists of the monthly loan payments made by homeowners and to a lesser degree  commercial property owners on their real estate loans 
our primary product focus is credit enhancing residential and commercial loans that are high quality 
high quality means real estate loans that typically have features such as low loan to value ratios  borrowers with strong credit histories  and other indications of quality relative to the range of loans within us real estate markets as a whole 
we currently sponsor the securitization through our sequoia program of all the residential real estate loans we acquire 
we also sponsor the re securitization through our acacia cdo program  of investment grade and  to a lesser degree  non investment grade real estate securities 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to provide high cash flow returns over a long period of time to help support our goal of maintaining steady dividends over time 
our reported gaap net income was million per share for in  gaap net income was million per share and was million per share in our results for were not as strong as the extraordinary results we achieved during  but are still at a level that we consider attractive 
our gaap return on equity was for compared to for and in better than expected credit results on the loans we credit enhance has been the primary driver of our continued strong earnings results 
for the residential real estate loans we credit enhance  delinquencies remain at historically low levels and annual credit losses continue to be less than one basis point of the current balance of these loans 
credit results for the commercial real estate loans we credit enhance have also been excellent

we permanently retained approximately of the ordinary real estate investment trust reit taxable income we earned during and we intend to declare and distribute the remainder of our reit taxable income as dividends by september in addition  we also retained the after tax profits earned in our non reit subsidiaries 
we anticipate following a similar pattern of retention and distribution in in the second half of we sold single b rated residential loan ces 
this portfolio adjustment was made to reduce overall residential credit risk levels and to raise cash for future investment opportunities 
we retained most of our first loss non rated ces while primarily selling second loss ces 
by changing our asset mix in this manner  we reduced our downside risk within our residential portfolio should credit losses increase  but retained most of the upside potential inherent in our portfolio that should be realized over time if residential credit losses continue to be low 

table of contents our net discount on all consolidated residential and commercial real estate loans and securities arm  fixed  and hybrid is million  or per share outstanding at december  the net discount at december  is million or per share on residential real estate assets and is million or per share on commercial real estate assets 
we will realize this million net discount as income over the next years to the extent it is not diminished by credit losses 
if faster residential prepayments continue  we will realize the residential portion of this income more quickly 
the health of the real estate industry is cyclical 
the tremendous growth in residential real estate prices appears to be slowing 
we believe it is probable that real estate fundamentals may deteriorate over the next two years  causing our credit losses to increase but also reducing acquisition prices for the assets we seek to buy 
as a result  our current plan  which is subject to change  is to invest our excess capital million at december  steadily over the next two to three years so that we maintain reduced risk levels while also capturing opportunities to acquire cheaper assets 
we will likely modify this plan as the market environment changes 
nevertheless  as a result of this general plan of action  it is likely that we will continue to have relatively high cash balances for some time 
our strong balance sheet and cash balances will be particularly helpful in the event unlikely  but possible  in our view that real estate credit fundamentals deteriorate significantly 
our mortgage conduit s residential loan securitization business is in transition 
in and prior years  we generated attractive levels of economic gains gain on sale through securitization by acquiring high quality one and six month libor adjustable rate residential loans from originators  selling the loans to sequoia securitization entities  and then sponsoring sequoia securitizations of these loans 
in today s flat to inverted yield curve environment however  libor indexed arms are not an attractive option for homeowners  causing origination volume of this product to decrease dramatically 
in addition  several wall street firms have recently entered the residential conduit business  increasing competition and reducing securitization gain on sale opportunities 
we are responding to these changes by broadening our residential conduit s product line both in terms of product type and loan quality characteristics and by expanding our mortgage originator customer base 
we are focusing on market areas and relationships where we believe we have  or can develop  a competitive advantage 
we expect our residential conduit business will break even economically this year while also not absorbing much capital 
even at break even levels  our residential conduit brings multiple benefits to our business as a whole and is an excellent source of assets for us to invest in 
in the longer term  we expect our residential conduit to develop in a manner that will once again generate attractive returns for our shareholders 
we continue to be large and active investors in the market for residential credit enhancement securities created by others  and we continue to allocate the greater part of our capital to these assets 
in the fourth quarter  we took advantage of some excellent acquisition opportunities 
acquisition pricing for some new assets improved  in part due to seasonal trends as a result of supply demand trends  the fourth quarter is usually a good time to buy assets and also due to concerns about the housing markets 
we are continuing to build our business of credit enhancing securitized commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate properties as a whole continue to improve their cash flows and valuations 
due to the level of competition in commercial credit enhancement  and due to weakening commercial loan origination standards  the prospective returns from commercial credit enhancement securities at the moment are acceptable  but not overwhelming 
we will continue to develop this business as part of our long term growth and diversification strategy  and are pleased with our accomplishments to date in this area 
the market for sponsoring cdo securitizations continues to be attractive  although it is has become more volatile 
we expect to continue sponsoring acacia cdo transactions during after we complete each securitization  we expect to acquire and invest in all or a portion of the cdo equity securities created in these transactions 
we expect that these will be attractive investments over time 
we believe that the cdo business is a fertile area for innovation 
in  we completed our first predominately commercial real estate cdo 
we may also incorporated 
table of contents synthetic assets in acacia s asset pools 
over the next few years  we expect our cdo sponsorship business to grow and evolve in interesting new ways and to continue to generate attractive new investments and asset management fees 
we seek to maintain a structured balance sheet that we believe should allow us to weather potential general economic downturns and liquidity crises 
we generally seek to put ourselves in a position where changes in interest rates would not be likely to materially harm our ability to meet our long term goals or maintain our regular dividend rate 
we use debt to finance loans and securities that we are accumulating as inventory for sale to securitization entities sponsored by us 
in our view  the long term outlook for our business is good 
housing price increases over the past several years have reduced our risk of credit loss in the future for our existing residential assets 
for most of our risk assets  the underlying loans were originated in and commercial property values and cash flows are increasing in many areas 
our portfolio of assets as a whole has the ability to generate attractive earnings  cash flows  and dividends in the future  assuming real estate credit losses do not increase materially 
in general  we expect per share earnings and the special dividend in will be lower than as a result of much higher cash balances  a newer portfolio on average the higher yielding seasoned assets have largely been sold or called  few gains from sales as we are not planning significant amount of sales at this time and calls as we have few callable assets  continued high premium amortization expenses on the residential loans consolidated from sequoia trusts as these loans continue to prepay rapidly  and for other reasons 
if we reduce our excess cash balances over the next few years  invest wisely  and start to realize some of the upside potential inherent in our existing assets  earnings and special dividends in and could increase from levels 
over the long term we believe it is reasonably likely that we will be able to continue to find attractive investment opportunities  because we are an efficient competitor and because our market segments are growing as the amount of real estate loans outstanding increases and the percentage of these loans that are securitized increases 
results of operations as compared to acquisitions  securitizations  sales  and calls during  we acquired million residential loan ces 
this was similar to the million we acquired in the loans underlying the ces we acquired during were generally of above average quality as compared to securitized residential loans as a whole 
in  we had calls of our residential loan ces of million principal value for gaap gains of million 
this was a decrease from the calls realized in of million principal value that generated gaap gains of million 
we had fewer of these assets become callable during at the end of  we had residential loan ces securities with principal value totaling million that were callable 
during  we sold million residential loan ces generating gaap gains of million 
during  sales of residential loan ces totaled million generated gaap gains of million 
sales in where higher due to our portfolio restructuring activities 
we acquired million commercial real estate loans during  a decrease from the million acquired during we sold million commercial real estate loans during and million during our commercial real estate loan activity provides additional collateral to the acacia cdo securitizations we sponsor 

table of contents during  we acquired million commercial loan ces  a significant increase from the million acquired in this increase reflects our ongoing efforts to increase our ability to analyze  source  and manage commercial real estate loan ces 
no commercial loan ces were sold during these periods 
in  our residential real estate loan acquisitions totaled billion 
we sold billion of these loans to sequoia entities and also sold million loans as whole loans to others  leaving us with an inventory of loans of million at december  sequoia entities issued billion asset backed securities abs during this level of residential loan securitization activity was a significant decrease from when sequoia entities acquired loans of billion and issued a like amount of abs 
typically we acquire london inter bank offer rate libor adjustable rate mortgage arm residential loans for the sequoia securitization program we sponsor  the flatter yield curve reduced the amount of libor arm residential loans originated in we acquired million of other residential and commercial real estate securities during as inventory for sale to our acacia cdo securitization program 
this was an increase from the million of these acquisitions we made for acacia during we sold securities to acacia entities totaling million during and million during at december   we had securities of million for sale to future acacias entities 
in both and  acacia entities issued million cdo abs 
net income our reported gaap net income was million per share for  a decrease from the million per share earned in our gaap return on equity was for compared to for the reduction in our net income of million from to resulted from a decrease in net interest income of million  an increase in operating expenses of million  an increase in provisions for income taxes of million  partially offset by an increase in net gains on sales and calls net of market valuation adjustments of million 
net interest income net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the reduction in net interest income of million resulted from increased arm prepayments rates on residential loans consolidated from sequoia securitization entities and lower yields on our portfolio of residential ces as our older higher yielding securities were called or sold  and from higher levels of unvested cash 
in addition  net interest income was higher in due to the effect of a cumulative correcting adjustment of an error on previously reported earnings of million which is further discussed below on page 
net interest income in benefited from a reduction in credit provision expenses of million as a result of excellent loan credit performance and reduced loan balances as prepayments for loans owned by sequoia accelerated while sequoia securitization volume dropped 
prepayment rates cpr for residential arm loans owned by sequoia entities increased from an average of in to in faster prepayments on arms have been caused primarily by the flatter yield curve higher than average short term interest rates relative to long term interest rates and the increase in popularity of negative amortization loans 
borrowers are more inclined to refinance out of arms and into hybrid or fixed rate loans when the effective interest rates on arms are not significantly lower than the fixed rate alternatives 
additionally  new forms of adjustable rate mortgages negative amortization  option arms  and moving treasury average arms represent an increased share of the arm market and have increased arm to arm refinancing 
these faster prepayment rates for consolidated arm loans had a negative impact on our net interest income in however  in the long term we believe we will likely benefit from faster

since a majority of the assets on our consolidated balance sheets are adjustable rate residential real estate loans  yields on these loans increase as short term interest rates rise 
as a result  total interest income was higher  even though the residential real estate loans consolidated balances decreased slightly from the prior year s level 
in addition to the impact of higher short term interest rates  the contribution from the other portfolios increased in  also leading to higher interest income

almost all these loans have coupon rates that adjust monthly or every six 
table of contents months based on the one or six month libor interest rate 
yields on these residential real estate loans increased as short term interest rates rose 
the average balance decreased as loan prepayments exceeded new acquisitions 
higher premium amortization expenses as a percentage of current loan balances in were caused primarily by increasing prepayment speeds on these loans 
table residential loan credit enhancement securities interest income and yield dollars in thousands interest income net discount amortization total interest income average residential loan credit enhancement securities yield as a result of interest income net discount amortization yield interest income recognized from residential loan ces increased primarily due to growth in our portfolio over the past year  partially offset by lower yields 
portfolio growth reflected our ability to find new assets at a pace in excess of our sales  calls  and principal prepayments 
yields decreased as many of our more seasoned  higher yielding assets higher yielding as a result of several years of strong credit performance and favorable prepayments were called or sold over the last few years 
the more recently acquired residential loan ces generally are being carried at lower effective yields because we do not expect the same strong credit performance or favorable prepayment patterns as we have had in the past  and because on average we acquired these assets at higher prices than in the past 
the yields we currently recognize on recently acquired residential loan ces may be less than the yields we will actually realize over the lives of these residential loan ces 
to determine yields on residential loan ces  we make assumptions regarding loan losses and prepayments 
since the market generally has a wide range for these assumptions and not a specific estimate  we apply assumptions within a range that generally results in yields on these assets in early periods of ownership that are lower than what we might realize over the life of the assets if future performance turns out to be better than the low range of our expectations 
specifically  the initial yield we book on certain residential loan ces may be lower than the market mid range expectation of performance and below our hurdle rate of pre tax and pre overhead internal rate of return 
we review the actual performance of each residential loan ces and the market s and our renewed range of expectations every quarter 
we adjust the yield of the assets as a result of supportable changes in market conditions and anticipated performance 
in addition  to the extent we credit enhance loans with special credit risk eg  negative amortization loans  we may not recognize interest income that is not paid 
we make ongoing determinations of the likelihood that any deferred interest payments will be collectible in recognizing current period yields

this increase was partially offset by lower yields on newer commercial loan ces 
the yield on commercial loan ces is based on our projected cash flows over time 
although we acquire commercial loan ces at a discount  we designate the amount of credit protection based on the anticipated losses in the underlying pool of loans 
since these commercial loan ces are the first loss pieces  the amount of credit protection so designated results in a premium balance to be amortized over the remaining lives of the assets 
over time  if the loans underlying these commercial loan ces perform better than we expect  we would re designate a portion of the credit protection to accretable discount  thereby reducing the unamortized premium balance and increasing the yield recognized on these assets

abs issuance premiums are created when interest only securities and other abs are issued at prices greater than principal value 
total consolidated interest expense increased as a result of a higher cost of funds due to an increase in short term interest rates as most of our debt and consolidated abs issued is indexed to one  three  or six month libor

operating expenses total operating expenses increased by from to due to investments in systems and infrastructure  increases in the scale of our operations  increased excise taxes  and increased accounting  consulting fees  and internal control costs 
generally  the scale of our business over the last few years has increased more rapidly than our operating expenses 
our operating costs continue to increase in part because of increased personnel needs resulting from both prior and anticipated growth 
the reconciliation of gaap operating expense to 
table of contents operating expense before excise tax and variable stock option income or expense is provided in the table below

management excludes excise tax and variable option expense or income vsoe vsoi in determining the efficiency ratio 
by excluding these items  management believes that we are providing a performance measure comparable to measures commonly used by other companies in our industry because these two types of excluded expenses do not reflect ongoing costs of day to day operations of our company 
stock option grant expenses under fas  however  are an on going expense and are included in operating expense before excise tax and vsoe vsoi 
excise tax is a function of the timing of dividend distributions 
in years when we delay distributing dividends on a portion of our reit taxable income  under the reit tax rules  we may pay excise taxes on a portion of this delayed distribution 
excise tax is included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
vsoe vsoi is a non cash expense or income item that varies as a function of redwood s stock price 
if our stock price increases during a quarter and the stock price is above the exercise price of certain variable options  we record a gaap expense in that period equal to the increase in the stock price times the number of in the money variable options that remain outstanding 
if our stock price decreases during a quarter  we record income in that period equal to the decrease in the stock price times the number of in the money variable options that remain outstanding 
with the adoption of financial accounting statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  effective january   we will not have vsoe vsoi  in future periods 
fixed compensation expenses include employee salaries and related employee benefits 
other operating expenses include office costs  systems  legal and accounting fees  and other business expenses 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in expanding our staff and developing our business processes and information technologies in order to meet the operating needs we will face as we grow in the long term 
as a result  we expect these fixed and other operating expenses will continue to increase 
incentive stock income expense represents the cost of equity compensation as determined under fas for options and option equity awards granted to employees and directors after december  beginning january   with the adoption of fas r  all remaining unvested incentive awards and all future awards will be accounted for under this principle 
beginning january   there will no longer be dividend equivalent right der expenses for gaap purposes as all remaining stock awards will be accounted for under fas r and the value of additional ders on an award is already included in the value at the time of grant and is expensed over the requisite service period of the award 

table of contents variable compensation includes employee bonuses which are based on individual employee performance and the adjusted return on equity earned by redwood and der expenses on certain options still outstanding and granted prior to december  the primary drivers of this expense are the profitability return on equity of redwood  taxable income at the reit which determines total dividend distribution requirements  the number of employees  and the number of incentive stock awards outstanding that receive der payments that are expensed options granted prior to january  
we currently anticipate that our fixed costs will increase in relative to  as we continue to add additional staff and systems for meeting our future growth 
however  we also expect that expenses for variable compensation will decline as our performance is not anticipated to be as strong 
thus  we anticipate total operating expenses will be at a similar level in as in the adoption of fas r will change the nature of our expenses but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our overall costs 
net recognized gains losses and valuation adjustments for  our net recognized gains and valuation adjustments totaled million as compared to million for realized gains due to calls were significantly less in at million than in at million as we had fewer securities that had reached their call factor 
gains in sales we initiated as part of our portfolio restructuring were greater in at million than in at million 
accounting rules fas  eitf  and sab m require us to review the projected discounted cash flows on certain of our assets based on credit  prepayment  and other assumptions  and to mark to market through our income statement those assets that have experienced any deterioration in discounted projected cash flows as compared to the previous projection that could indicate permanent impairment as defined by gaap 
assets with reduced discounted projected cash flows are written down in value through a non cash income statement charge if the current market value for that asset is below our current basis 
if the market value is above our basis  our basis remains unchanged and there is no gain recognized in income 
it is difficult to predict the timing or magnitude of these adjustments  the quarterly adjustment could be substantial 
under the accounting rules fas  eitf  and sab m  we recognized other than temporary impairments of million for and million for some of our interest rate agreements are accounted for as trading instruments and in we de designated one agreement as part of our call of an acacia securitization 
as a result  we recognized gains of million in and losses of million in on these interest rate agreements 
provisions for income taxes as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year 
therefore  we generally pass through substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on this income and the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
taxable income calculations differ from gaap income calculations 
we provide for income taxes for gaap purposes based on our estimates of our taxable income  the amount of taxable income we permanently retain  and the taxable income we estimate was earned at our taxable subsidiaries 
our income tax provision in was million  an increase from the million income tax provision taken in in  our income tax provision under gaap benefited slightly from state net operating losses 
in  we were able to use state and federal net operating losses to reduce our tax liability 
in addition  in  we recognized a reversal of previously existing valuation allowances related to net operating losses nols  thus recognizing the future value of remaining net operating losses at that time 

table of contents furthermore  in we generated taxable gains on sales from our securitization activities at the taxable subsidiaries 
gains on these activities were much lower in due to decreased volumes and a significant decrease in the gains generated by each securitization 
since these securitizations were treated as financings under gaap  deferred tax assets were created 
the deferred tax assets are amortized through the deferred tax provision as the related gaap income is recognized 
taxable income and dividends total taxable income is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
it is the pre tax income calculated for tax purposes 
estimated total taxable income is an important measure as it is the basis of our dividend distributions to shareholders 
taxable income calculations differ significantly from gaap income calculations 
reit taxable income is that portion of our taxable income that we earn in our parent company and reit subsidiaries 
it does not include taxable income earned in taxable non reit subsidiaries 
we must distribute at least of reit taxable income as dividends to shareholders over time 
as a reit we are not subject to corporate income taxes on the reit taxable income we distribute 
the remainder of our taxable income is income we earn in taxable subsidiaries 
we pay income tax on this income as we generally retain the after tax income at the subsidiary level 
we also pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain we can retain up to of the total

annual total taxable income per share and annual reit taxable income per share are  respectively  the sum of the four quarterly total taxable income per share and reit taxable income per share calculations 
total taxable income and total taxable income per share decreased in from the primary reason for this was decreased levels of capital invested in assets not only ces but also io and other securities  and fewer gains on sales on securitizations at the taxable subsidiaries as a result of lower volume of securitizations and less gain per transaction 
in addition  the current yield we report for tax purposes on our new assets is much higher than the yield we report for gaap purposes 
this is true for those assets that have concentrated credit risk as  for tax purposes  credit losses are not anticipated but rather are only expensed as incurred 
it is also true for other assets as  due to fast prepayments  some premium amortization expense for tax purposes has been delayed because we cannot recognize a negative yield for tax purposes on interest only securities  this delayed premium amortization expense will likely impact the taxable gain or loss on sale or call in a future period 

table of contents dividends to stockholders during totaled million  approximately million of which represented the distribution of the balance of reit taxable income earned in based on our estimates of reit taxable income  we will enter with million of undistributed reit taxable income which we will pay as dividends to our stockholders during we currently project that most of the first three regular quarterly dividends we pay in will consist of reit taxable income earned in our estimates of total taxable income and reit taxable income are subject to change due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations 
during  a portion of taxable income was in the form of net capital gains resulting from the sales and calls of some of our residential loan ces 
our income from this activity was long term capital gain income for tax purposes 
thus  during  of our dividends distributed was characterized as a distribution of long term capital gain income and the remaining was characterized as a distribution of ordinary income 
our tax paying stockholders may benefit to the degree they can take advantage of the lower tax rate on capital gains versus ordinary income 
as of december   we had met all of the dividend distribution requirements of a reit 
we generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit level that would be likely to generate distributions of unrelated business taxable income ubti or excess inclusion income to our stockholders  or that would cause prohibited transaction taxes on the reit  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
as compared to acquisitions  securitizations  sales  and calls for the year ended  residential real estate loan acquisitions totaled billion  sales to sequoia entities totaled billion  and sequoia entities issued billion abs 
this activity was a slight decrease from the volume of residential loan acquisitions billion  sales to sequoia billion  and abs issued billion in during  we acquired million residential loan ces

we acquired million commercial real estate loans during  an increase from the million acquired during we sold million commercial real estate loans during and million during during  we acquired million commercial loan ces  we did not acquire any such securities in no commercial loan ces were sold during these periods 
we acquired million of other residential and commercial real estate securities during for our acacia cdo securitization program 
this was similar to the level of such acquisitions million during during  we sold million of securities to acacia entities and during  we sold million to acacia entities 
in  acacia entities issued million of cdo abs  compared to million in net income our reported gaap net income was million per share for  an increase from the million per share earned in our gaap return on equity was for compared to for 
table of contents our results were driven by the quality of our existing real estate loan backed investments  a favorable operating environment  excellent credit results  favorable prepayment patterns  increased book value per share giving us a greater amount of equity per share with which to generate earnings  increased capital efficiencies  increased operating efficiencies  and income generated from residential ces that we owned at a discount to face value that were called during at full face value 
a significant portion of our income in and has come from gains from calls and sales of residential ces securities 
returns from these sources are highly variable and not readily predictable

table of contents during the course of reviewing the application of sfas for the third quarter of  we realized that there were several provisions of that standard that we had been applying inappropriately 
the impact of this error was that  on a cumulative basis  we had accelerated loan acquisition premium amortization by million 
under the provisions of apb reporting accounting changes and sab materiality  we analyzed the impact of the error on each period affected 
after carefully assessing the effect of this error on previously reported earnings and the effect of recording a cumulative correcting adjustment of million in the third quarter  we determined that the error was not material to previously issued financial statements or to the financial statements for the nine months ended september  and the year ended december  accordingly  a cumulative correcting adjustment of million was recorded and resulted in a decrease in loan acquisition premium amortization and an increase in net income on our consolidated statements of income and an increase in the residential real estate loan balance on our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources impact of hurricanes in during the third quarter of  hurricanes katrina and rita hit the gulf coast states  including parts of louisiana  mississippi  and texas 
we own both residential and commercial securities that have first loss risk on loans in the affected areas 
based on available information and our analysis  we continue to believe our hurricane related losses as measured for tax will be between million to million on the residential and commercial loans we credit enhance 
we do not anticipate an impact to our future gaap earnings as a result of these hurricanes as these losses are included in our credit reserves 
we regularly update our estimates and will adjust our credit reserves accordingly 
there can be no assurance that actual losses will fall within this range as there are many factors yet to be determined such as insurance claims  the state of the local economy  and the strength or weakness of the real estate markets in the affected areas 
assets each of our product lines and portfolios is a component of our single business of investing in  credit enhancing  and securitizing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our consolidated earning assets  as presented for gaap purposes  consist of five portfolios residential real estate loans  residential loan ces  commercial real estate loans  commercial loan ces  and securities portfolio 
a discussion of the activities in each of these portfolios appears below 
residential real estate loans residential loans shown on our consolidated balance sheets include loans owned by securitization entities we have sponsored plus loans we own typically on a temporary basis prior to sale to a securitization entity 
loans underlying residential credit enhancement securities we have acquired from securitizations that were not sponsored from us do not appear on our consolidated balance sheets 
the consolidated balance of residential real estate loans at december  of billion was lower than the billion we reported at december  prepayments on loans consolidated for gaap purposes were greater than acquisitions of new loans 
this was the result of both an increase in prepayment speeds and a decrease in the volume of acquisitions and sponsored securitizations 
prepayment speeds increased in arms as a result of a flattening of the yield curve an increase in short term interest rates relative to long term interest rates 
this change in the yield curve also served to reduce the new production of adjustable rate loans indexed to libor in the marketplace  reducing our acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we face increased competition to purchase these loans 
at december   redwood owned million residential real estate loans accumulated for future securitizations 
none of these loans were pledged to support redwood debt 
abs securitization entities consolidated on redwood s balance sheet owned billion of residential real estate loans on december  charge offs credit losses recorded in this portfolio totaled million during  million in  and million in credit losses remained at an annualized rate of less than basis point during these periods 
serious delinquencies increased from million at december  to million at december  serious delinquencies include loans delinquent more than days  in bankruptcy  in foreclosure  and real estate owned 
as a percentage of this loan portfolio  serious delinquencies remained at low levels relative to the us residential real estate loans as a whole  and were of our current loan balances in this portfolio at december   an increase from at december  the reserve for credit losses on residential real estate loans is included as a component of residential real estate loans on our consolidated balance sheets 
the residential real estate loan credit reserve balance of million was of the current balance of this portfolio at 
table of contents december   compared to million or at december  the total amount of credit reserves did not decrease over the year even though the balance of loans decreased  this decline in loan balance was offset by increased delinquencies and a worsening credit outlook 
residential loan credit enhancement securities for gaap purposes  this portfolio includes residential real estate loan ces acquired from securitizations sponsored by others 
it does not include ces we acquired from our sequoia entities 
we mark residential loan ces to their current estimated market value on our consolidated balance sheets but not generally through our consolidated statements of income unless we determine there is other than temporary impairment 
at december   our reported ownership of these residential loan ces totaled million 
this was an increase from the million market value we reported on december  our acquisitions plus net positive market value adjustments exceeded calls  sales  and principal pay downs for as a result of the concentrated credit risk associated with residential loan ces  we are generally able to acquire these securities at a discount to their face principal value 
the difference between the principal value billion and adjusted cost basis million of these residential loan ces at december  was million  of which million was designated as internal credit protection reflecting our estimate of likely credit losses on the underlying loans over the life of these securities  while the remaining million represented a purchase discount we will accrue into income over time

at december   we had million of external credit enhancement and million of internally designated credit protection for this portfolio 
the combined balance of external and internally designated credit protection represented basis points of the billion of 
table of contents loans underlying our credit enhancement portfolio 
the amount of credit protection and the related risks are specific to each credit enhancement interest 
there were million credit losses for the underlying loans during  million credit losses during  and million in the annualized rate of credit loss was less than basis point of the current balance of underlying loans

the level of delinquencies on these loans is below national levels 
in  we recognized million losses due to other than temporary impairment on our residential loan ces 
we recognized million of other than temporary impairments for and million during these losses are included in net recognized gains and valuation adjustments in our consolidated statements of income 
commercial real estate loans we have been investing in commercial real estate loans since our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased during to million at december  from million at december  due to the acquisition of million loans  offset by sales  principal pay downs  and amortization 
we plan to continue to make additional investments in commercial real estate loans  including mezzanine loans  subordinated junior or second lien loans  and b notes b notes represent a structured commercial real estate loan that retains a higher portion of the credit risk and generates a higher yield than the initial loan 
factors particular to each of our other commercial loans eg  lease activity  market rents  and local economic conditions could cause credit concerns for our commercial loans 
if this occurs  we may need to provide for future losses by establishing a credit reserve 
we continually monitor and determine the level of appropriate reserves for our commercial loans 
at december   we had an million reserve on a loan  which is the same reserve we had established at acquisition of this loan 
we acquired this loan at a discount to par and designated a credit reserve based on our expected cash flows at that time 
we have no other credit reserves for any of our other commercial real estate loans 
commercial loan credit enhancement securities we acquire unrated first loss interests in cmbs and fund them with equity 
we define these non rated cmbs as commercial loan ces 
at december   we owned million principal value of these securities with a market value of million 
this was an increase from the million principal value and million market value we owned at december   as we increased acquisitions of these securities 
some of the commercial loan ces we own represent an interest in a commercial cmbs re remic consisting primarily of first and second loss interests in several other cmbs 
at december   we credit enhanced billion commercial real estate loans through ownership of first loss cmbs excluding the re remic interests an increase from the billion commercial real estate loans we credit enhanced at december  serious delinquencies ie  plus days  in bankruptcy  in foreclosure  or reo were million  or  of the loan balances at december   there were no delinquencies on these loans at december  we incurred no credit losses on these underlying loans in or we did not own first loss cmbs securities in

also included in this portfolio are non investment grade interests in commercial real estate securities excluding commercial loan ces  manufactured housing securities  corporate bonds issued by reits  and equity in cdos sponsored by others 
we have sold most of our securities in this consolidated portfolio as reported for gaap purposes to acacia bankruptcy remote securitization entities 
acacia issues cdo abs to fund its acquisition of these assets 
we consolidate these acacia s assets as securities portfolio assets however  bb rated residential loan ces are consolidated within our residential loan ces 
we reflect acacia s issuance of cdo abs as abs issued obligations on our consolidated balance sheets

these accumulated assets are pledged to secure the associated debt 
additional collateral in the form of additional qualifying assets or cash may be required to meet changes in market values from time to time under these agreements 
these borrowings have maturities of less than one year and interest rates that generally change monthly based upon a margin over the one month libor interest rate 
our debt levels vary based on the timing of our asset accumulation and securitization activities 
during  as measured daily  our maximum debt level was million  our minimum debt level was million  and our average debt level was million 
redwood s debt was secured by mostly investment grade securities accumulated as inventory for sale to acacia securitization entities 
we also have an unsecured line of credit available that was not drawn upon as of december  covenants associated with a portion of our short term debt generally relate to our tangible net worth  liquidity reserves  and leverage requirements 
we have not had  nor do we currently anticipate having  any problems in meeting these covenants 
however  many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our ability to meet these covenants and may affect our liquidity in the future 
in march  we formed madrona residential funding  llc madrona  a special purpose entity and wholly owned subsidiary of rwt holdings 
madrona gives us the flexibility to access the capital markets and issue short term debt instruments to finance the accumulation of loans prior to sale to sponsored securitization entities 
madrona is designed to fund residential loans accumulated for eventual sale to our sequoia securitization program by issuing a p rated commercial paper 
madrona was established to accumulate up to billion of loans with a current authorization for million and can warehouse each loan up to days 
there are specific eligibility requirements for financing loans in this facility that are similar to our existing financing facilities with several banks and large investment banking firms 
there is a credit reserve account for approximately basis points that will serve as credit enhancement to the commercial paper investors 
in addition  we issued million of a bbb rated madrona abs to provide further credit support to the holders of commercial paper 
this facility has a three year term 
as of december   there was no commercial paper issuance outstanding 
asset backed securities issued redwood consolidates on its balance sheets the abs that are obligations of those securitization entities that are sponsored by redwood 
these abs issued are not obligations of redwood 

table of contents sequoia had billion abs outstanding on december  compared to billion on december  pay downs of existing abs issued by sequoia exceeded new issuance 
acacia entities issued abs of a type known as cdos to fund their acquisitions of real estate securities from redwood 
acacia cdo issuance outstanding was billion on december  and billion on december  we issued billion of acacia abs in for  there were million of acacia abs pay downs  which includes million related to the redemption of acacia cdo stockholders equity our reported stockholders equity increased by during  from million at december  to million at december  as a result of million earnings  million dividends declared  million stock issuance  million proceeds from stock option exercises  million non cash equity adjustments  and a million net decrease in the unrealized gains of assets and interest rate agreements that are marked to market through our consolidated balance sheets 
we may seek to issue additional shares even during a period when we are maintaining uninvested cash balances 
this would allow us to accommodate additional portfolio growth while also using cash balances to reduce overall risk and insure funding for future opportunities 
as always  we issue equity only when we believe such issuance would enhance long term earnings and dividends per share  compared to what they would have been otherwise 
certain assets are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income  these adjustments affect our book value but not our net income 
as of december   we reported a net accumulated other comprehensive income of million and at december  we reported net accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
changes in this account reflect increases in the fair value of our earning assets positive million and interest rate agreements positive million  and also reflect changes due to calls  sales  and other than temporary impairments of a portion of our securities million 
our reported book value at december  was per share 
cash requirements  sources of cash  and liquidity we use cash to fund our operating and securitization activities  invest in earning assets  service and repay redwood debt  fund working capital  and fund our dividend distributions 
one primary source of cash is principal and interest payments received on a monthly basis from real estate loans and securities 
this includes payments received from abs that we acquired as investment assets from abs securitizations we sponsor 
other sources of cash include proceeds from sales of assets to securitizations entities  proceeds from sales of other assets  borrowings  and issuance of common stock 
we currently use borrowings solely to finance the accumulation of assets for future sale to securitization entities 
sources of borrowings include repurchase agreements  bank borrowings  and forms of collateralized short term borrowings  and non secured lines of credit 
we may also issue commercial paper 
our borrowings are typically repaid using proceeds received from the sale of assets to securitization entities 
for residential loans  our typical inventory holding period is one to twelve weeks 
for securities held for sale to acacia cdo securitization entities  our typical holding period is one to six months 
our consolidated statements of cash flows includes cash flows generated and used by the abs securitization entities that are consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets 
cash flows generated within these entities are not available to redwood  except to the degree that a portion of these cash flows may be due to redwood as an owner of one or more of the abs issued by the entity 
cash flow obligations of and uses of cash by these abs entities are not part of redwood s operations and are not obligations of redwood  although a decrease in net cash flow or an increase in credit losses generated by an abs entity could defer or reduce or 
table of contents potentially eliminate interest and or principal payments otherwise due to redwood as an owner of certain more risky abs issued by the entities 
in connection with our internal year end preparation and review of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we determined that the consolidated statement of cash flows for the quarter ended september  reflected an error as it included misclassified amounts 
specifically  redwood did not follow the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
statement of cash flows exemption of certain enterprises and classification of cash flows from certain securities acquired for resale an amendment of fasb statement no 
 that requires cash receipts resulting from sales of loans that were not specifically acquired for resale to be classified as cash flows from investing activities 
in the third quarter of  redwood sold million in loans  million of which we had acquired in earlier periods 
when acquiring these earlier loans  our intention was to keep these on our consolidated balance sheets through the sequoia program  and  in prior periods  the consolidated statement of cash flows had correctly reflected the purchase of these loans within cash flows from investing activities 
however  upon the sale of these loans in the third quarter  we classified the receipts as cash flows from operating activity 
management believes this error is immaterial as it does not have any impact on earnings  the balance sheet  total cash flow  taxable income  or dividends 
as a result of this discovery  we have corrected the classifications of these cash flows and have included in this annual report on form k a correct consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we have concluded that the misclassification of cash flows in the third quarter of was the result of a significant deficiency in the design or operation of our internal controls regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles and the review process of the implementation of accounting guidance 
we have discussed the significant deficiency described above with the audit committee 
our management is working to identify and implement corrective actions where required to improve the effectiveness of our internal controls  including the enhancement of our systems and procedures 
at december   we had million unrestricted cash and unpledged liquid assets of our short term debt balances available to meet potential liquidity needs 
increases or decreases in this ratio at different balance sheet dates primarily are the result of the timing of sale of assets to securitization entities 
while we anticipate maintaining a strong liquidity position  our ratio of liquid assets to short term debt will fluctuate as we continue to fund our real estate loans and other securities with short term borrowings prior to securitization 
at this time  we see no indications or materially negative trends that we believe would be likely to cause us a liquidity shortage 
net liquidity at december  was million 
net liquidity is the amount of unrestricted cash we would have had on hand if we had sold all the loans and securities we are accumulating for future sale at their estimated market value million on december  and used the proceeds to pay off redwood s debt million on december  
net liquidity is available for cash needs such as dividend distributions  acquiring new permanent assets  and supporting our securitization efforts 
under our internal risk adjusted capital guidelines  million of this net liquidity at december  was excess liquidity available to support growth in our business 
the remainder of the net liquidity balance was required under our risk adjusted capital guidelines to support our current assets and other operating needs and liquidity risks such as the risk of requiring cash to post as margin for interest rate agreements if interest rates move adversely for these agreements 
we are not going to be in a hurry to invest our excess capital 
while we remain optimistic about the performance of the housing markets  we are starting to see numerous signs of weakness in the housing markets today 
we believe that a weakening of the housing market  if it continues  likely bring excellent asset acquisition opportunities over the next few years 
in order to take advantage of future opportunities  our goal is to maintain cash balances that are available to 
table of contents make new investments 
our current plan  which is subject to change  is to invest our excess cash steadily over the next two to three years 
off balance sheet commitments at december   in the ordinary course of business  we had commitments to purchase million of real estate loans that settled in these purchase commitments represent derivative instruments under fas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the value of these commitments was negligible as of december  contractual obligations and commitments the table below presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   as well as the consolidated obligations of the securitization entities that we sponsored and are consolidated on our balance sheets

market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and market value risk in a prudent manner designed to insure redwood s longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor  to the best of our ability  to provide our stockholders with both a steady regular dividend and an attractive long term return 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do take 
credit risk our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans 
we assume credit risk with respect to residential and commercial real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial loan ces and similarly structured securities acquired from securitizations sponsored by others and from sequoia securitizations sponsored 
table of contents by us 
these securities have below investment grade credit ratings due to their high degree of credit risk with respect to the residential real estate loans within the securitization entities that issued these securities 
credit losses from any of the loans in the securitized loan pools reduce the principal value of and economic returns from residential loan ces 
we assume credit risk with respect to commercial real estate loan through the ownership of commercial loan ces acquired from securitizations sponsored by others 
we are highly leveraged in an economic sense due to the structured leverage within the securities we own  as the amount of residential and commercial real estate loans on which we take first loss risk is high relative to our equity capital base 
however  we do not use debt to fund these assets and our maximum credit loss from these assets excluding loans and securities held temporarily as inventory for securitization is limited and is less than our equity capital base 
the majority of our credit risk comes from high quality residential real estate loans 
this includes residential real estate loans consolidated from abs securitizations from which we have acquired a credit sensitive abs security  and loans we effectively guarantee or insure through the acquisitions of residential loan ces from securitizations sponsored by others 
we are also exposed to credit risks in our commercial real estate loan portfolio  the first loss commercial real estate securities we own  our other residential and commercial real estate securities  and with counter parties with whom we do business 
credit losses on residential real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens  our credit losses could be increased beyond levels that we have anticipated 
the interest rate is adjustable for most of the loans securitized by securitization trusts sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan ces we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners will rise under the terms of these arms  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
in addition  a portion of the loans we credit enhance are interest only and negative amortization loans  which may have special credit risks 
in the fourth quarter  we continued to acquire credit enhancement securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to high quality residential borrowers 
even though most of these loans are made to high quality borrowers who make substantial down payments and do not need a negative amortization feature in order to afford their home  we still expect significantly higher delinquencies and losses from these loans compared to regular amortization loans 
nevertheless  we believe we have a good chance of generating attractive risk adjusted returns on these investments as a result of the way the securitizations of these riskier loan types are structured and because of attractive acquisition pricing of these credit enhancement securities 
although seemingly attractive  there is substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
as a result  we will limit our overall investment in these credit enhancement securities 
credit losses on commercial real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of the property  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the property  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices 
in addition  if the us economy weakens  our credit losses could be increased beyond levels that we have anticipated 
the large majority of the commercial loans we credit enhance are fixed rate loans with required amortization 
a small number of loans are interest only loans for the entire term or a portion thereof  which may have special credit risks 
in addition to residential and commercial loan ces  the acacia entities we also sponsor own investment grade and other securities typically rated aaa through b  and in a second loss position or better  or otherwise effectively more senior in the credit structure as compared to a 
table of contents residential loan ces or commercial loan ces or equivalent held by us issued by residential securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
generally  we do not control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation efforts with respect to these assets 
some of the securities acacia owns are backed by sub prime residential loans that have substantially higher risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
these lower quality residential loans can be expected to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and losses to acacia and thus redwood interest in could occur 
most of acacia s securities are reported as part of our consolidated securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets 
acacia has also acquired investment grade bb rated  and b rated residential loan securities from the sequoia securitization entities we have sponsored 
the probability of incurring a credit loss on these securities is less than the probability of loss from first loss residential loan ces and commercial loan ces  as cumulative credit losses within a pool of securitized loans would have to exceed the principal value of the subordinated ces and exhaust any other credit protections before losses would be allocated to the acacia securities 
if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  however  these acacia securities could have their credit ratings down graded  could suffer losses in market value  or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely reduce our returns from the acacia cdo equity securities we have acquired and may reduce our ability to sponsor acacia transactions in the future 
interest rate risk our strategy is to maintain an asset liability posture on a consolidated basis that is effectively match funded so that the achievement of our long term goals is unlikely to be affected by changes in interest rates 
this includes assets owned and the abs issued by consolidated securitization entities  to the extent that any mismatches within the entities could affect our cash flows 
we use interest rate agreements so that the interest rate characteristics of the abs issued by consolidated securitization entities  as adjusted for outstanding interest rate agreements  closely matches the interest rate characteristics of the assets owned by those entities 
overall  we believe we maintain a close match between the interest rate characteristics of redwood debt and the pledged assets 
for most of our debt funded assets assets acquired for future sale to sponsored securitization entities or to other financial institutions as whole loans  the floating rate nature of our debt closely matches the adjustable rate interest income earning characteristics of the accumulated assets 
not all of the accumulated assets we acquire are adjustable rate 
we also acquire fixed rate and hybrid rate securities for re securitization through our acacia cdo program  and we may acquire hybrid rate residential real estate loans in the future for our sequoia securitization program 
we typically use interest rate agreements to hedge associated interest rate mismatches when the assets we accumulate for future securitizations do not match the interest rate characteristics of our debt 
at december   we consolidated billion adjustable rate abs collateralized by adjustable rate assets and billion fixed hybrid rate abs collateralized by consolidated fixed hybrid rate assets 
we owned the io security  cdo equity  or similar security that economically benefits from the spread between the assets and the liabilities of the issuing securitization entity on a portion billion of these consolidated entities 
these assets and liabilities are closely matched economically and to the degree there is a mismatch we attempt to reduce this mismatch through the use of interest rate agreements 
for the remainder of the consolidated abs entities billion  we do not own the security that benefits from the asset liability spread 
thus  spread changes between the yield of these assets and the cost of these liabilities do not affect our economic profits or cash flow 
thus  we do not utilize interest rate agreements with respect to interest rate mismatches that may exist between these assets and liabilities on these other consolidated abs entities 
the remainder of our consolidated assets at december  million six month adjustable rate assets  million short term fixed rate assets  million hybrid and fixed rate assets  and million non earning assets were funded  for interest rate matching purposes  effectively with equity 

table of contents prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount 
amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in short term interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and thus change effective yield calculations on certain loans may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization taken to income on liabilities even when the underlying assets are the same ie  the prepayments are identical 
we believe there is a relatively low likelihood of prepayment risk events occurring within our securitization inventory assets  as we typically sell these loans within a few months of acquiring them 
however  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market prices for abs especially io securities sold by these securitization entities  and thus could affect the gain on sale for economic and tax purposes not for gaap purposes since these are accounted for as financings that we seek to earn from sponsoring these securitizations 
there are prepayment risks in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities such as ces benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans and premium securities such as io securities benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
our largest current potential exposure to increases in prepayment rates is from short term residential arm loans 
however  as of december   our premium balances on io securities backed by arm loans were less than our discount balances on residential loan ces backed by arm loans 
as a result  we believe that as of december   we are biased in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of arm prepayments 
however  in the short term  for gaap  changes in arm prepayment rates could cause gaap earnings volatility 
arm prepayment rates are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
prepayment rates on the arms underlying the redwood sponsored sequoia securitizations increased from near to nearly over the last year as the yield curve flattened 
through our ownership of discount residential loan ces backed by fixed rate and hybrid residential loans  we generally benefit from faster prepayments on fixed and hybrid loans 
prepayment rates for these loans typically accelerate as medium and long term interest rates decline 
prepayments can also affect our credit results and risks 
credit risks for the ces we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
market value risk at december   we reported on a consolidated basis billion assets that were marked to market through our balance sheet ie  available for sale securities but not through our income statement 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons  had hybrid coupon rates  and the remaining had fixed coupon rates 
many of these assets are credit sensitive 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the balance of our stockholders equity base 
market value fluctuations for our securities can affect not only our earnings and 
table of contents book value  but also our liquidity  especially to the extent these assets may be funded with short term debt prior to securitization 
most of our consolidated real estate assets are loans accounted for as held for investment and reported at cost 
although these loans have generally been sold to sequoia entities at securitization and  thus  changes in the market value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity in the long term  changes in market value during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with debt may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we use interest rate agreements to manage certain interest rate risks 
our interest rate agreements are reported at market value  with any periodic changes reported through either our income statement or in our balance sheet 
adverse changes in the market values of our interest rate agreements which would generally be caused by falling interest rates may require us to devote additional amounts of cash to margin calls 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and  as a reit  our dividends must equal at least of our net reit taxable income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and how changes in estimates might affect our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in recent weeks we have become aware of a potential technical interpretation of gaap that differs from our current accounting presentations 
we have not changed our accounting treatment for this potential issue 
however  if we were to change our current accounting presentations based on this interpretation we do not believe there would be a material impact on our net income or balance sheets 
this issue relates to the accounting for transactions where assets are purchased from a counterparty and simultaneously financed through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty and whether these transactions create derivatives instead of the acquisition of assets with related financing which is how we currently present these transactions 
this potential technical interpretation of gaap does not affect the economics of the transactions but may affect how the transactions would be reported in our financial statements 
our cash flows  our liquidity  and our ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and we do not believe our taxable income would be affected 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on consolidated earning assets  we employ the interest method and determine an effective yield to account for purchase premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees or costs associated with purchasing and financing real estate loans and securities 
for consolidated real estate loans  the interest method is applied as prescribed under fas for loans acquired prior to july   the interest method or effective yield is determined using interest rates as they change over time and future anticipated principal prepayments 
for loans acquired subsequent to that date  the initial interest rate of the loans and future anticipated principal prepayments are used in determining the effective yield 
for our 
table of contents consolidated securities  the interest method to determine an effective yield is applied as prescribed under fas or eitf using anticipated principal prepayments 
the use of these methods requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each asset 
these projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  when certain tests will be met that may allow for changes in payments made under the structure of securities  estimates regarding the likelihood and timing of calls of securities at par  and other factors 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis and monitor these projections based on input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we constantly review our assumptions and make adjustments to the cash flows as deemed necessary 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
under the interest method  decreases in our credit loss assumptions embedded in our cash flow forecasts could result in increasing yields being recognized from residential loan ces 
in addition  faster than anticipated prepayment rates would also tend to increase realized yields over the remaining life of an asset 
in contrast  increases in our credit loss assumptions and or slower than anticipated prepayment rates could result in lower yields being recognized under the interest method and may represent an other than temporary impairment under gaap  in which case the asset may be written down to its fair value through our consolidated statements of income 
redwood applies apb and apb in determining its periodic amortization for the premium on its debt  including the issuance of io securities and deferred bond issuance cost dbic 
we arrive at a periodic interest cost that represents a level effective rate on the sum of the face amount of the abs issued and plus or minus the unamortized premium or discount at the beginning of each period 
the difference between the periodic interest cost so calculated and the nominal interest on the outstanding amount of the abs issued is the amount of periodic amortization 
prepayment assumptions used in modeling the underlying assets to determine accretion or amortization of discount or premium are used in developing the liability cash flows that are used to determine abs issued premium amortization and dbic expenses 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations valuation adjustments to real estate loans held for sale are reported as net recognized losses and valuation adjustments on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
adjustments to the fair value of securities available for sale are reported through our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity within the cumulative unrealized gains and losses classified as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the exception to this treatment of securities available for sale is when a specific impairment is identified or a decrease in fair value results from a decline in estimated cash flows that is considered other than temporary 
in such cases  the resulting decrease in fair value is recorded in net recognized gains losses and valuation adjustments on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
we estimate fair value of assets and interest rate agreements using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
we believe estimates we use reflect market values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell assets 
our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment in interpreting relevant market and other data 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to  interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  and other market factors 
we apply these factors to each of our assets  as appropriate  in order to determine market values 
residential real estate loans held for sale are generally valued on a pool basis while commercial real estate loans held for sale and securities available for sale are valued on an asset specific basis 
we review our fair value calculations on an ongoing basis 
we monitor the critical performance factors for each loan and security 
our expectations of future performance are shaped by input 
table of contents and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we review our existing assumptions relative to our and the market s expectations of future events and make adjustments to the assumptions that may change our market values 
changes in perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the value of our assets 
should such changes or other factors result in significant changes in the market values  our net income and book value could be adversely affected 
in addition to our valuation processes  we are active acquirers and occasional sellers of assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
thus  we believe that we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the marketplace and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets 
in addition  we use third party sources to validate our valuation estimates 
there are certain other valuation estimates we make that have an impact on current period income and expense 
one such area is the valuation of certain equity grants 
for equity awards granted prior to january   we use the principles provided by apb  interest on receivables and payables 
for all subsequent awards  fas applies 
furthermore  fas r will become the appropriate principle january  credit reserves for consolidated residential and commercial real estate loans held for investment  we establish and maintain credit reserves that we believe represent probable credit losses that will result from inherent losses existing in our consolidated residential and commercial real estate loans held for investment as of the date of the financial statements 
the reserves for credit losses are adjusted by taking provisions for credit losses recorded as a reduction in interest income on residential and commercial real estate loans on our consolidated statements of income 
the reserves consist of estimates of specific loan impairment and estimates of collective losses on pools of loans with similar characteristics 
to calculate the credit reserve for credit losses for residential real estate loans and helocs  we determine inherent losses by applying loss factors default  the timing of defaults  and the loss severity upon default that can be specifically applied to each pool of loans 
the following factors are considered and applied in such determination on going analysis of the pool of loans  including  but not limited to  the age of the loans  underwriting standards  business climate  economic conditions  geographic considerations  and other observable data  historical loss rates and past performance of similar loans  relevant environmental factors  relevant market research and publicly available third party reference loss rates  trends in delinquencies and charge offs  effects and changes in credit concentrations  prepayment assumptions 
once we determine the applicable default rate  the timing of defaults  and the severity of loss upon the default  we estimate the expected losses of each pool of loans over their expected lives 
we then estimate the timing of these losses and the losses probable to occur over an effective loss confirmation period 
this period is defined as the range of time between the probable occurrence of a credit loss such as the initial deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and the confirmation of that loss the actual charge off of the loan 
the losses expected to occur within the effective loss confirmation period are the basis of our credit reserves because we believe those losses exist as of the reported date of the financial statements 
we re evaluate the level of our credit reserves on at least a quarterly basis and record provision  charge offs  and recoveries monthly 
the credit reserve for credit losses for the commercial real estate loans includes a detailed analysis of each loan and underlying property 
the following factors are considered and applied in such determination 

table of contents on going analysis of each individual loan  including  but not limited to  the age of the loans  underwriting standards  business climate  economic conditions  geographic considerations  and other observable data  on going evaluation of fair values of collateral using current appraisals and other valuations  discounted cash flow analysis  borrower s ability to meet obligations 
if residential loan becomes reo or a commercial loan becomes impaired  or loans are reclassified as held for sale  specific valuations are primarily based on analyses of the underlying collateral 
residential and commercial loan ces are the securities issued by an abs securitization entity that bear most of the initial credit risk of the underlying pool of loans that was securitized 
as a result of the relatively high credit risks of these investments  we are able to purchase residential and commercial loan ces at a discount to principal par value 
a portion of the purchase discount is subsequently accreted as interest income under the interest method while the remaining portion of the purchase discount is considered as a form of credit protection 
the amount of credit protection is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our assets  including economic conditions  characteristics of the underlying loans  delinquency status  past performance of similar loans  and external credit protection 
we use a variety of internal and external credit risk analyses  cash flow modeling  and portfolio analytical tools to assist us in our assessments 
if cumulative credit losses in the underlying pool of loans exceed the principal value of the first loss piece  we may never receive a principal payment from that security 
the maximum loss for the owner of these securities  however  is limited to the investment made in purchasing the ces 
in addition to the amount of losses  the timing of future credit losses is also important 
in general  the longer credit losses are delayed  the better our economic returns  as we continue to earn coupon interest on the face value of our security 
accounting for derivative instruments interest rate agreements we use derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as market value risk and interest rate risk 
currently  the majority of our interest rate agreements are used to match the duration of liabilities to assets 
the derivative instruments we employ include  but are not limited to  interest rate swaps  interest rate options  options on swaps  futures contracts  options on futures contracts  options on forward purchases  and other similar derivatives 
we collectively refer to these derivative instruments as interest rate agreements 
on the date an interest rate agreement is entered into  we designate each interest rate agreement under gaap as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge  or held for trading trading instrument 
we currently elect to account for most of our interest rate agreements as cash flow hedges  the remainder are accounted for as trading instruments 
we record these derivatives at their estimated fair market values  and record changes in their fair values in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
these amounts are reclassified to our consolidated statements of income over the effective hedge period as the hedged item affects earnings 
any ineffective portions of these cash flow hedges are included in our consolidated statements of income  and any changes in the market value on our hedges designated as trading instruments 
we may discontinue gaap hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
a discontinued hedge may result in recognition of certain gains or losses immediately through our consolidated statements of income  or such gains or losses may be accreted from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings over the original hedging period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide a discussion about market risks in item of this annual report on form k 
to supplement these discussions  the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our consolidated balance sheets 
this table presents just one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  based on certain underlying assumptions 
there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the existing characteristics of our portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with this interest rate scenario 
actual prepayment speeds will likely vary significantly from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
however  in determining the fair market values of many of these assets  potential credit losses are included 
as discussed throughout this annual report on form k  our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the information provided in this table is based on our existing portfolio at december  under one set of assumptions 
the composition of our balance sheet and the set of assumptions used at december   differs slightly from those used at december   and  as a result  the presentation of the tabular information presented this year differs from a year ago 
the balance of residential loans is lower and we now also consolidate hybrid loans and the balance of securities is greater 
the assumptions we use reflect the market conditions at the date of the financial statements  so the future interest rates assumed and corresponding prepayment speeds used to project the cash flows differ from those used a year ago 
however  the overall results are similar in that our future results still depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans although the tabular information assumes no credit losses  future interest rates as many of our assets are adjustable rate  and prepayment behavior on residential mortgages
