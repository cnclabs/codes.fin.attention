the company has five reportable business segments local  wireless  hardware and managed services  other  and broadband 
the broadband segment no longer has any substantive  on going operations 
in  the company continued to make progress on its primary objectives  which were to reduce indebtedness  defend its core franchise against increasing competition  and add to the company s growth businesses 
reduce indebtedness the company reduced total indebtedness by  from  million at december  to  million at december   primarily with operating cash flows 
this reduction is net of an million increase to debt from the million repayment premium on the senior subordinated discount notes due the notes and the million write off of debt discounts on those notes 
the repayment of the notes was funded with the proceeds from a million term loan issued under the new corporate credit facility and borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
because of the lower interest rates on the company s corporate credit facility as compared to the notes  the company s cash payment for interest expense will be reduced by approximately million to million annually  and its interest expense will be reduced by million to million annually 
defend the core franchise against increasing competition the company defended its core franchise through bundling  adding  net subscribers to its custom connections sm super bundle which offers local  long distance  wireless  dsl  and the company s value added service package  custom connections  on a single bill at a price lower than the amount the customer would pay for all of the services individually 
the company finished the year with  super bundle subscribers  more than at the end of total access lines declined by versus  in line with company expectations given wireless substitution and other competitive factors 
the company believes that its super bundle customers are less likely to disconnect existing services and change services to a competitor 
add to growth businesses the company increased data revenues in the local segment by million primarily as a result of an addition of  digital subscriber line dsl subscribers 
the company finished the year with  dsl subscribers  an increase of over penetration of its dsl product increased to of addressable access lines 
the company increased wireless subscribers from  at december  to  at december  the company experienced particularly strong subscriber growth in its fourth quarter in  increasing its subscribers by  in this quarter 
the increase was the company s largest increase in wireless subscribers in any quarter since the fourth quarter of  which the company believes is a result of continued improvements to its wireless network s service quality and the introduction of more attractive rate plans 
the company s postpaid subscriber churn improved from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the company opened a new data center facility in  increasing the company s managed service and hardware revenues 
sales of information technology it and computer related hardware totaled million during  which was a increase over hardware sales 
results of operations consolidated overview the financial results for   and referred to in this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to consolidated revenue totaled  million in  an increase of million  compared to the increase was primarily due to the following million lower revenues in the local segment due to losses of access lines  partially offset by increased data and dsl revenues  million lower revenues in the wireless segment due to lower service revenue  million increased revenues in the hms segment primarily due to increased it and computer related  telephony and other equipment sales  and million lower revenues in the other segment  as million of increased long distance revenues partially offset million of decreases from businesses which the company has exited 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease was primarily due to the following million decrease in local operating income primarily as a result of lower revenue discussed above  million increased pension  postretirement benefits and medical expenses  and an increase of million in network and other related expenses from the out of territory expansion  partially offset by lower operating taxes of million  lower depreciation of million  and lower restructuring charges of million  million decrease in wireless operating income primarily due to decreased revenue discussed above and increased impairment charges of million associated with tdma assets  partially offset by decreases in roaming expense of million and million of decreased depreciation and amortization  primarily associated with the accelerated amortization in of certain intangibles  million increase in hms operating income primarily due to the margin on increased hardware revenues  and million increase in the other segment primarily related to an increase at cbad in long distance revenue  and lower long distance costs resulting from the installation of a long distance switch in june the minority interest caption relates to the minority interest of cingular in the net income of cincinnati bell wireless llc 
the tdma asset impairment charges discussed above gave rise to cbw losses in  and the minority interest income add back of million in represents cingular s portion of the cbw losses 
as a result of the company s purchase of cingular s interest in cbw on february   the company will recognize minority interest expense or income through this date of purchase  but no further minority interest expense or income will be recorded after this date as cbw will be wholly owned 
interest expense decreased to million for compared to million in this decrease is primarily a result of the net decrease of million from the extinguishment of the notes in august  partially offset by interest on the corporate credit facility  which funded the repayment of the notes 
the loss on extinguishment of debt of million for was comprised of a million loss related to the repurchase of the notes and million associated with the repayment of previously existing credit facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
income tax expense was million for although the company had pre tax losses for the year  income tax expense results from legislation that the state of ohio passed on june  instituting a gross receipts tax and phasing out ohio s corporate franchise and income tax over a year period 
as a result of this legislation  the company no longer expects to realize state income tax benefits associated with million of deferred tax assets previously recorded 
therefore  the company reduced deferred tax assets and increased income tax expense by million in additionally  the company had non deductible expenses including interest on securities originally issued to acquire its broadband business the broadband securities or securities that the company has subsequently issued to refinance the broadband securities 
as a result of these items  the company recorded income tax expense of million even though it had a loss before income taxes of million 
for the future  the company expects its effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates primarily due to the non deductible expenses associated with the broadband securities 
the company used federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to substantially defray payment of federal and state tax liabilities in as a result  the company had net federal and state cash tax payments of million during the year 
in february  the kentucky revenue cabinet issued state tax regulation  which may limit the company s ability to use its state net operating loss carryforwards against future state taxable income 
the company expects this will result in a one time income tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of compared to consolidated revenue totaled  million in  which was million  or  less than foregone revenue associated with disposed broadband assets is the primary reason that revenue has declined 
revenue of the broadband segment  which no longer generates any revenue  decreased million or million net of intercompany eliminations in compared to related to the sale of its assets  which were located outside of the company s local telephone or wireless operating territories  the company estimates that revenue in its hms segment decreased approximately million in also  revenue in the local segment declined million during as data revenue growth from dsl transport and dial up internet access only partially offset declines in voice revenue 
operating income for was million 
operating income in was million  which includes a gain on the sale of broadband assets of million 
the decrease in operating income from to was primarily due to the following million decrease in the broadband segment due to the gain on sale of broadband assets of million in  million decrease in local operating income as a result of decreased revenues discussed above and million of increased restructuring charges  partially offset by decreases in operating taxes of million due to changes in state tax laws and depreciation expense of million  million decrease in wireless operating income primarily as a result of increased costs of million for handset sales  subsidies and advertising related to new gross customer additions  increased depreciation and amortization of million primarily related to accelerated depreciation on tdma assets and accelerated amortization on roaming and trade name intangibles  and asset impairments of million on assets removed from service  million decrease in hms operating income primarily as a result of reduced revenue from customer attrition and price decreases  million increase in other operating income primarily due to decreased access charges in the long distance business associated with installation of long distance switching equipment in june and renegotiation of wholesale long distance minute costs  and million decrease in corporate costs primarily due to termination benefits incurred in in accordance with certain senior executives employment agreements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest income of million in relates to the minority interest of cingular in the net income of cbw 
this compares to minority interest expense of million in as a result of a million decline resulting from the exchange of the junior exchangeable preferred stock of brcom the preferreds for common stock of the company in september and a decline in the net income of cbw 
interest expense of million in decreased million compared to this was primarily the result of an million reduction in amortization of note issuance costs related to the prepayment of the company s credit facilities in  and million of lower interest expense primarily due to the net of approximately million reduced average debt outstanding offset partially by the issuance of the million notes in july and the issuance of the notes 
the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in the loss is comprised of million from retirement of the remaining million of brcom notes and related accrued interest of million in exchange for approximately million shares of common stock of the company  which had a fair value of million at the exchange date 
additionally  the company wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment and amendments of the company s credit facilities 
these losses were offset by a non cash gain of million from the company purchasing all of its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due  which bore interest at a rate of  at a discounted price equal to of their accreted value 
the company had income tax expense of million in compared to a benefit of million in the increase in expense is primarily the result of the fourth quarter reversal of the company s deferred income tax valuation allowance as a result of the substantial resolution of uncertainties related to brcom s liquidity 
the effective income tax rate in is  which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of certain non deductible interest expense amounts  benefits from the reduction of certain state deferred tax valuation allowances and recurring state income tax expenses 
the company used million of federal and state operating loss tax carryforwards in to defray payment of the majority of its federal and state tax liabilities 
the company paid million in federal and state tax liabilities during effective january   the company recorded a benefit of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of taxes  related to the adoption of sfas the benefit principally related to the estimated telephone plant removal costs previously included in accumulated depreciation  which were reversed 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of sfas discussion of operating segment results the company realigned its business segments in cbts  a data equipment and managed services subsidiary  was previously reported in the broadband segment and is now reported in the hardware and managed services segment 
additionally  the sale of telephony equipment of cbt and its associated installation and maintenance business  previously reported in the local segment  is now included in the hms segment 
accordingly  the historical results of operations of the local  hms  and broadband segments have been recast to reflect the current segment reporting 
local the local segment provides local voice telephone service  including enhanced custom calling features  and data services  which include dedicated network access  gigabit ethernet and asynchronous transfer mode based data transport  and dsl and dial up internet access  to customers in southwestern ohio  northern kentucky  and southeastern indiana 
these services are provided primarily by cbt  which operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec in its operating territory of an approximate mile radius of cincinnati  ohio 
cbt s network has full digital switching capability and can provide data transmission services to approximately of its addressable access lines via dsl 
outside of its ilec territory  the local segment provides these services through cincinnati bell extended territories llc cbet  which operates as a competitive local exchange carrier clec both in the communities north of cbt s operating territory and in the greater dayton market 
cbet provides voice services for residential as well as voice and data services for business customers on its own network and by purchasing une l s or une platform from the ilec 
cbet provides service through une l to its customer base in the dayton  ohio market 
the local segment links its cincinnati and dayton geographies through its fiber networks  which provides route diversity via two separate paths

access lines within the segment s ilec territory decreased by  or  from  at december  to  at december   which the company believes results from several factors including customers electing to use wireless communication wireless substitution in lieu of the traditional local service  company initiated disconnections of customers with credit problems  and customers electing to use service from other providers 
the company has partially offset its access line loss in its ilec by targeting voice services to residential and small business customers in dayton  ohio 
the company had  total access lines outside its ilec service territory at december   a increase from the prior year 
data revenue consists of data transport  high speed internet access including dsl  dial up internet access  digital trunking  and local area network lan interconnection services 
the increase in data revenue of million for as compared to is due to higher dsl revenue and data transport revenue 
an increase in average dsl subscribers of  partially offset by a slightly lower average rate per subscriber  produced an additional million in revenue for as compared to also  data transport revenues were million higher in as compared to these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in dial up internet revenues  attributable to both a decrease in rate and average subscribers  as dial up customers migrate to dsl 
as of december   the company s dsl penetration of addressable access lines was approximately  up from at december  the company believes its rate of access line loss would have been greater and its increase in dsl subscribers would have been less without the success of its custom connections sm super bundle 
the company added  super bundle subscribers during  bringing total subscribership to  of which  were consumer ilec subscribers  a penetration of access lines 
the company s super bundle offers local  long distance  wireless  dsl  and the company s value added service package  custom connections  on a single bill at a price lower than the amount the customer would pay for all of the services individually 
an aggressive marketing campaign and the favorable bundled pricing associated with custom connections sm super bundle has increased the demand for the company s zoomtown dsl offering  which added  subscribers in  growing compared to december   to  subscribers 
as a result of this growth  total lines to the customer defined as access lines plus dsl subscribers as of december  decreased only slightly compared to december   and revenue per household increased to

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million compared to higher costs of million for pension  postretirement and employee medical expenses were more than offset by lower advertising costs of million  lower labor and other employee costs  and lower consulting fees 
depreciation expense decreased million in compared to the decreases were primarily due to changes in depreciation rates in the fourth quarter of used as a result of updated estimates of the depreciable assets useful lives 
in  the company initiated a restructuring to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating expenses resulting in a charge of million 
the company incurred a million charge in related to the outsourcing of its directory assistance services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
compared to local service revenue of million during decreased  or million  compared to revenue declines related to access line losses were partially offset by dsl revenue growth 
voice revenue of million in decreased  or million  compared to local service revenue declined million as a result of both fewer access lines in service  which declined from  at december  to  at december   and a lower average revenue per line 
the lower average revenue per line is the result of selected price discounts to enterprise customers and certain rate plans related to the service launch in dayton  ohio 
access lines within the segment s ilec territory decreased  or  from  to  the majority of this decrease is a  decrease in residential access lines  which the company believes is primarily due to customers electing to use wireless communication wireless substitution in lieu of the traditional local service 
in march  the company expanded its product suite in dayton  ohio and began to mass market voice services to residential and small business customers 
this helped to increase clec access lines by  lines during  bringing total access lines outside its ilec service territory to  which is of its total access lines at december  voice revenues also declined million as a result of decreases in trunking revenue and million as a result of decreases in value added services revenue due to price decreases to consumers and small businesses provided within the company s custom connections sm super bundle 
data revenue in was million  representing a million  or  increase compared to internet based revenue  high speed dsl and dial up access increased million in primarily driven by a  increase in dsl subscribers  which were  at december  as of december   of cbt s access lines in its incumbent local exchange operating territory were loop enabled for dsl transport with a penetration of approximately of total access lines  up from at december  other high speed high capacity data services such as transport  digital trunking  lan  and customized services revenue decreased million in as a result of both competitive pressures and regulatory mandated price decreases for wholesale services sold to other telecommunications providers 
the company believes that its rate of access line loss would have been greater and its increase in dsl subscribers would have been less without the success of its custom connections sm super bundle 
the company added  new  super bundle subscribers in  to reach a total of  a increase compared to december  at december   of cbt s primary residential  ilec access lines were in a super bundle 
also  as a result of its success  the local segment in territory revenue per consumer household local revenue divided by average primary access lines increased by  or  to in compared to in other services revenue of million during decreased million compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in wiring revenue 
costs and expenses cost of services and products decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decline in operating taxes of approximately million  of which million relates to a change in ohio law 
cbt was no longer subject to franchise taxes based on gross receipts  but instead was subject to state and local income tax and included in the combined ohio state income tax return with other cincinnati bell operating companies 
see accounting for taxes in the critical accounting policies and estimates section for discussion of ohio tax legislation passed in june that will impact future state income tax expense and operating tax expense 
additionally  cost of goods sold and material costs declined million during related to lower material costs associated with the decrease in wiring revenue compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in this increase was due to an additional million of advertising and promotional expense related to a increase in dsl gross additions and  gross additions in dayton local customers 
total labor and related expense decreased million  or  as compared to primarily as a result of a million curtailment charge in related to the sale of substantially all of the broadband assets 
a reduction in cbt s headcount also helped to keep labor costs otherwise relatively flat 
depreciation expense of million decreased million  or  in compared to  due to a decrease in depreciable assets and reduced capital spending

wireless the wireless segment provides advanced digital  voice and data communications services through the operation of a regional wireless network in a licensed service territory  which surrounds cincinnati and dayton  ohio and includes areas of northern kentucky and southeastern indiana 
the segment offers service outside of its regional operating territory through wholesale and re sale arrangements roaming agreements with other wireless operators 
the segment also sells related telecommunications equipment  wireless handset devices and related accessories to support its service business 
the wireless segment consists of cbw  which was historically a joint venture with cingular wireless corporation pcs  llc cingular  in which the company owned of cbw while cingular owned the remaining 
on february   the company purchased cingular s interest such that cbw is now a wholly owned subsidiary 
since october  cbw has deployed service on both tdma and gsm networks 
as of december   cbw had transitioned more than of its subscribers to gsm technology  which provides voice communication  short message service sms or text messaging  and enhanced data communication services  such as mobile web browsing  internet access  email  and picture messaging 
in the first quarter of  the company completed its upgrade to enhanced data rates for gsm evolution edge  which required only software upgrades to deliver higher speeds of data transmission and capacity

arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  excluding roaming revenue  by the average subscriber base for the period 
compared to revenue service revenue decreased by million in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributed to the following million decrease in postpaid subscriber service revenue due to lower arpu 
the company s postpaid arpu decreased by compared to due to lower priced gsm rate plans and bundling plans  slightly offset by an increase in data revenues 
the increase in subscribers from  at december  to  at december  is the result of the company s efforts to recover subscribers that were lost as a result of network quality problems encountered in at the early stages of the company s network migration from tdma to gsm 
the company has resolved the difficulties encountered in  and fourth quarter net activations gross activations less deactivations of  in compared favorably to a loss of net subscribers of  in the same period of average churn for the year was approximately 
however  churn declined over the course of the year from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of this was due to the resolution of the aforementioned network problems and the introduction of more attractive rate plans  million increase in prepaid service revenues primarily due to an increase in average subscribers 
as of december   prepaid subscribers totaled approximately  compared to  at december  prepaid arpu was flat compared to  as higher data arpu offset lower voice arpu 
average monthly prepaid customer churn increased from in to in primarily as a result of increased competition  and million decrease in roaming revenue due to a decrease in minutes of use as a result of the merger between cingular and at t wireless services inc cbw has lost substantial roaming revenue as cingular customers are now using cingular s network versus cbw s network 
as part of cbw s agreement with cingular  a substantial portion of this lost roaming revenue is offset by a rate reduction on the cost of roaming minutes purchased from cingular 
for  roaming expense decreased million compared to total wireless subscribers at december  were approximately  which represents approximately of the population in cbw s licensed operating territory 
equipment revenue increased by million as the company sold  more handsets during as compared to as  more tdma customers migrated to the company s gsm network 
costs and expenses cost of services and products consists largely of network operation costs  roaming expense whereby cbw incurs costs associated with its subscribers using their handsets while in the territories of other wireless service providers  interconnection expenses  and cost of handsets and accessories sold 
the decrease in costs of services of million compared to was due to lower roaming expense of million resulting from the renegotiation of rates with cingular noted above  partially offset by million of higher handset and accessory costs related to the equipment revenue increase and million of higher operating taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses include certain customer acquisition expenses  such as advertising  distribution and promotional expenses 
these expenses were flat as compared to increases in advertising and promotional expenses of million were offset by decreased fees for outsourced services as a result of better negotiated rates and lower legal claim costs for the roaming litigation that was incurred in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company further revised its estimate of the remaining useful lives of certain of the tdma assets  resulting in additional depreciation 
the depreciation increase for versus results from the accelerated depreciation on tdma assets as well as on certain gsm assets that were replaced in late as part of the company s continued initiative to improve gsm network quality 
the company incurred charges of million in to write down the recorded value of its tdma network assets 
a portion of the tdma assets were taken out of service in in order to optimize the remaining spectrum associated with tdma assets 
this resulted in a charge of million 
additionally  an asset impairment charge of million was incurred to write down to fair value the remaining tdma assets in use 
due to the rapid migration of tdma subscribers to the company s gsm network and lower arpu associated with the remaining tdma customers  the remaining future cash flows associated with the tdma assets could no longer support the recorded value of the tdma assets  resulting in the impairment charge 
after the charges  the book value of tdma network assets was less than million at december  the company expects to discontinue its tdma network in asset impairment charges in were recorded to write down certain tdma assets taken out of service and certain intangible assets 
amortization expense in was a result of accelerated amortization related to the change in estimated economic useful life of certain roaming and trade name agreements as a result of the merger between cingular and at t wireless services on october  compared to revenue wireless segment revenue increased million  or  to million during compared to equipment revenue increased million in primarily due to a increase in new service activations and of cbw s existing tdma customers purchasing new handsets to switch their service to the company s new gsm service 
this increase in equipment revenue offset a million decrease in roaming revenue and a million decrease in cbw subscriber service revenue 
cbw s roaming revenue declined primarily as a result of a decrease in average revenue per roaming minute as a greater amount of awe roaming traffic used lower priced gsm minutes than in total roaming revenue equaled million in subscriber service revenue declined million as a result of a million postpaid service revenue decrease more than offsetting a million increase in prepaid service revenue 
postpaid revenue decreased as a result of a  decrease in subscribers  driven primarily by an average monthly customer churn which increased to in compared to in  and a decrease in postpaid arpu  excluding roaming revenue  from in to  which is in part the result of customer migrations to lower priced gsm rate plans 
the company believes that the increase in postpaid churn during the year is the result of a combination of factors  most notably network quality issues created by cbw s network migration 
at december  cbw had  postpaid subscribers 
prepaid service revenue increases were largely the result of increased subscribers 
as of december   prepaid subscribers totaled approximately  a  increase over december  likely a result of both the aforementioned network quality issues as well as unmeasured tdma customer migrations to the new gsm network  average monthly prepaid customer churn increased to in compared to in total wireless subscribers at december  were approximately  or approximately of the population in cbw s licensed operating territory

wlnp did not have any significant impact in costs and expenses cost of services and products increased million  or  to million in compared to the prior year 
the increase was due largely to an million increase of costs associated with increased handset subsidies  which supported both a increase in new gross customer additions as well as the migration of of the company s legacy tdma customers to its new gsm network 
in the fourth quarter of  cbw recorded a million adjustment related to prior periods to account for certain rent escalations associated with its tower site leases on a straight line basis 
these rent escalations are associated with lease renewal options that were deemed to be reasonably assured of renewal  thereby extending the initial term of the leases 
the adjustment was not considered material to the current year or to any prior years earnings  earnings trends  or individual financial statement line items 
additionally  customer service expense increased million as a result of increased customer contacts  driven by the gsm migration and quality issues  which was offset by a decrease in incollect expense of million 
lower incollect expense was the result of a decrease in the average cost per roaming minute of which a greater percentage was on the lower priced gsm network 
selling  general  and administrative expenses of million increased by million  or  in  primarily as a result of a million increase in advertising and promotional expense to support the increase in new customer gross additions 
depreciation expense of million increased million in compared to the increase was a result of million in additional depreciation related to the change in estimated economic useful life of the tdma network to december  amortization expense of million increased million in compared to the increase was a result of million in accelerated amortization related to the shortened  estimated economic useful lives of certain awe roaming and trade name agreements  as a result of the merger between cingular wireless and awe  consummated on october  asset impairment charges of million in were comprised of million recorded to write down certain tdma assets  which cbw removed from service  and a million asset impairment charge related to certain intangible assets

the cbts business model links the capability to sell a wide range of equipment from various manufacturers along with the company s technical and infrastructure capability to offer complete technology solutions for the small  medium  and large business customer 
in march  cbts sold certain out of territory operations  which negatively impacted hardware revenue by million 
this decrease was more than offset by increased hardware sales from core cbts operations 
this increase in core cbts hardware sales was due to a million increase in it and computer related hardware revenue  resulting primarily from increased hardware revenue from data center customers 
cbts expanded its data center business with the purchase of its mason  ohio data center in late and the opening of its florence  kentucky data center in june the increased hardware sales were for equipment used in cbts data centers as well as for equipment to be used at customer facilities 
higher revenue for the sale of telephony and other equipment accounted for the remaining increase in the newly operational data centers and increased hardware sales directly contributed to an increase of million in managed and data center services revenue in  partially offset by decreased revenues of million related to the sale of out of territory offices and lower professional services revenue of million 
data center service revenue increased in as a result of the florence facility opening in and the mason facility being operational for a full year  in addition to increased revenue generated from services provided to cbts data center customers outside of cbts facilities

operational costs of the new data center facilities increased million in as both facilities were running during  and managed services costs increased million related to higher revenue 
these increases in were partially offset by lower professional services costs and lower operating costs due to the sale of out of territory operations 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to  is attributed to increased employee benefits expenses  sales commissions  and other performance based compensation as a result of the revenue and earnings increases over  offset by decreases as a result of the sale of out of territory assets in the increase in depreciation expense in over is due to capital expenditures associated with providing data center collocation services 
although revenue increased during  operating margins decreased from the margin decrease is primarily due to an increased proportion of equipment sales  which have lower operating margins than service revenue

subsequent to july  and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  cbw ceased deferral of revenue and cost related to customer connections and activations 
as cbw s activation costs exceed activation revenues  both the activation revenue and associated costs are recorded upon the sale of the wireless handset 
this change did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company follows the guidance in eitf to determine whether more than one unit of accounting exists in an arrangement 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  total consideration is allocated to the individual units of accounting based on their relative fair value  determined by the price of each deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting as delivered or as service is performed depending on the nature of the deliverable comprising the unit of accounting 
the company recognizes equipment revenue generally upon the performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
the company is a reseller of it and telephony equipment and considers the criteria of eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  when recording revenue  such as title transfer  risk of product loss  and collection risk 
based on this guidance  these equipment revenues and associated costs have generally been recorded on a gross basis  rather than recording the revenues net of the associated costs 
prior to the sale of the broadband assets in  broadband transport services were billed monthly  in advance  while revenue was recognized as the services were provided 
in addition  the company had entered into indefeasible right of use iru agreements  which represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber  recording unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically paid cash or other consideration upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue was recognized over the life of the agreement as services were provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
in the event the buyer of an iru terminated a contract prior to the contract expiration and released the company from the obligation to provide future services  the remaining unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in the period in which the contract was terminated 
the company generated million in non cash iru revenue in concurrent with the broadband asset sale in  substantially all of the remaining iru obligations were assumed by the buyer of the broadband assets 
pricing of local services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in adjustments to revenue in future periods 
the company monitors these proceedings closely and adjusts revenue accordingly 
accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company established the allowances for uncollectible accounts using percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on these methods 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations or if general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
substantially all of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances are with entities located within its geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for the remainder of the company s accounts receivable balances 
no one entity or collection of legally affiliated entities represents or more of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets pursuant to statement of financial account standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
substantially all of the company s goodwill relates to its wireless segment 
the company estimated the fair value of cbw based on expected future cash flows generated by cbw discounted at 
the estimated fair value of cbw was higher than its carrying value  and  as such  there was no indication of impairment at december  indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of federal communications commission fcc licenses for spectrum of the wireless segment 
the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
the fair value of the licenses was appraised by an outside party using the greenfield method 
the appraised value of the licenses was higher than its carrying value  and  as such  there was no indication of impairment at december  reviewing the carrying values of property  plant  and equipment the company s provision for depreciation of its telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the group depreciation method 
provision for depreciation of other property  other than leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is probable or reasonably assured 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the company estimates the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of the local segment plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives change 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing impairments  the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company shortened the estimated remaining economic useful life of its legacy tdma wireless network to december  due to the expected migration of its tdma customer base to its gsm network 
in  the change in estimate reduced operating income and net income by million and million  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per share were decreased by and  respectively  as a result of this change in estimate 
as part of the process of redeploying spectrum from the company s legacy tdma wireless network to its gsm network to meet unexpected increasing demand for its gsm services  the company made the decision in the first quarter of to retire certain tdma assets in order to optimize its tdma network performance 
as a result of this early retirement of assets  in the first quarter of the company recorded a charge of million under the caption asset impairments and other charges 
in the second quarter of  the useful life of certain of the remaining tdma assets was shortened from the december  date being used  and depreciation was accelerated 
the change in depreciation expense due to the change in estimate in the second quarter decreased operating income and net income by million and million  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per share were decreased by per share as a result of this change in estimate 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the rapid migration of tdma customers to the company s gsm network and decreased revenue per remaining tdma subscriber  the company determined that the carrying value of the tdma assets was not recoverable from the estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
therefore  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of to record the tdma assets at fair value 
the company calculated the fair value of the assets based on the appraised amount at which the assets could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption asset impairments and other charges 
after the impairment charges  the carrying value of the tdma assets was less than million at december  if technological change were to occur more rapidly than expected  it may have the effect of shortening the estimated depreciable life of other network and operating assets that the company employs 
this could have a substantial impact on the consolidated depreciation expense and net income of the company 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect the company s ability to generate cash flow from its network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of the company s tangible or intangible assets 
this could have a substantial impact on the operating results of the consolidated company 
prior to the beginning of  the company estimated net removal costs for outside plant assets of cbt and to the extent these costs exceeded gross salvage values  the company increased its periodic depreciation expense to capture the difference between estimated net removal costs and gross salvage values in accumulated depreciation 
when the company retired these assets and expended the net removal costs  the company recognized net removal costs as a reduction to accumulated depreciation 
in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  effective january   the company removed the then existing accrued costs for the removal of outside telephone plant from the accumulated depreciation accounts 
these accrued costs totaled million  net of taxes  which the company recognized as income 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the company had previously accrued for net removal costs in excess of salvage value in depreciation expense  depreciation expense for cbt was million lower in than it would have otherwise been absent this accounting change 
cbt expensed million of cost of products and services in related to net removal costs in excess of salvage value 
accounting for taxes income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
the company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires 
the company s federal income tax audit periods through have been closed 
the company establishes liabilities for tax exposures it believes are probable of payment and believes adequate provision has been made for all open tax years 
however  the ultimate resolution of these issues may differ from the amounts currently estimated  in which case an adjustment would be made to the tax provisions in that period 
on june   legislation was passed in the state of ohio instituting a gross receipts tax and phasing out ohio s corporate franchise and income tax over a five year period 
as a result of this legislation  the company does not expect it will be able to realize income tax benefits associated with million of deferred tax assets previously recorded  of which approximately million relates to ohio net operating losses 
the remaining amount of approximately million relates to the revaluation of other ohio deferred tax assets to estimates of future realizable value 
therefore  the company recognized additional income tax expense of approximately million in this additional income tax expense is based upon projections of taxable income  timing of reversing temporary differences  and the company s current business structure 
as of december   the company had million in net deferred tax assets  which includes billion in federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  with a deferred tax asset value of million 
the tax loss carryforwards are available to the company to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the company utilized approximately million of gross federal tax net operating loss carryforwards during the remaining tax loss carryforwards will generally expire between and and are not currently limited under us tax laws 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  the company expects to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
in addition to the federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of million and deferred tax temporary differences and other tax attributes of million 
a valuation allowance of million is provided at december  against certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period 
the company determines its effective tax rate by dividing its income tax expense by its income before taxes as reported in its consolidated statement of operations 
for reporting periods prior to the end of the company s fiscal year  the company records income tax expense based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
this rate is computed using the statutory tax rate and an estimate of annual net income adjusted for an estimate of non deductible expenses 
the company s effective tax rate in was adversely affected by the million income tax expense associated with the change in ohio tax law noted above  as well as by the non deductible interest expense related to securities originally issued to acquire its broadband business the broadband securities or securities which the company has subsequently issued to refinance the broadband securities 
as a result of these items  the company recorded income tax expense of million even though it had a loss before income taxes of million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s income taxes 
operating taxes the company incurs certain operating taxes that are reported as expenses in operating income  such as property  sales  use  and gross receipts taxes 
these taxes are not included in income tax expense because the amounts to be paid are not dependent on the level of income generated by the company 
the company also records expense against operating income for the establishment of liabilities related to certain operating tax audit exposures 
these liabilities are established based on the company s assessment of the probability of payment 
upon resolution of audit  any remaining liability not paid is released and increases operating income 
the company recognized million of income in upon resolution of certain operating tax audits  net of new liabilities established  of which million was associated with the broadband segment 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company recognized million and million of income in and  respectively  upon resolution of operating tax audits  net of new liabilities established 
accounting for pension and postretirement expenses the company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans one for eligible management employees  one for non management employees and one supplemental  nonqualified  unfunded plan for certain senior executives 
the company also provides health care and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees 
the key assumptions used to account for the plans are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate a discount rate is selected annually to measure the present value of the benefit obligations 
in determining the selection of a discount rate  the company estimates the timing and amounts of expected future benefit payments and applies a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high quality bonds 
based on the analysis  the discount rate was set at for all of the plans as of december  at december   the discount rates were set at and for the pension plans and postretirement plans  respectively 
expected rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the following the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and  the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
to the extent the company changed its estimate of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  there would be an impact on pension expense or income and the associated net liability or asset 
the company uses an assumed long term rate of return of for the company s pension and postretirement trusts 
actual asset returns for the pension trusts  which represent nearly of invested assets  were approximately in and in in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
health care cost trend the company s health care cost trend rate is developed on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the health care cost trend rate used to measure the postretirement health benefit obligation at december   was and is assumed to decrease gradually to by the year the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans point change pension benefits postretirement and other benefits dollars in millions increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense discount rate expected return on assets health care cost trend rate n a n a the assumption for cost sharing with retirees is also important to determining the postretirement and other benefits expense 
the company s collectively bargained for labor contracts have historically had limits on the company funded portion of retiree medical costs referred to as caps 
however  the company had waived the premiums in excess of the caps for bargained for retirees who retired during the contract period 
similar benefits have been provided to non bargained retirees 
prior to december   the company s actuarial calculation of retiree medical costs included the assumption that the caps were in place in accordance with the terms of the collectively bargained for agreement 
effective december   based on its past practice of waiving the retiree medical cost caps  the company began accounting for its retiree medical benefit obligation as if there were no caps 
the accounting using this assumption remained in effect through may in may  the company reached an agreement with the union for bargained for employees as to the terms of a new labor contract 
employees retiring under the new agreement are provided company sponsored healthcare through the use of individual health reimbursement accounts hras  which provides for company contributions of a fixed amount per retiree that the retiree can use to purchase their healthcare from among the various plans offered 
the company agreed to increase the hra amount annually over the life of the labor agreement 
the retiree pays for healthcare premiums and other costs in excess of the hra amount 
contrary to past practice  no agreement was made to waive the implementation of this cost sharing feature 
based on this new agreement  effective june   the company modified its assumptions for the actuarial calculation of retiree medical costs  including assumptions regarding cost sharing by retirees 
postretirement medical and other expense was million for the five month period from january to may and including the effect of these assumption changes  million for the seven month period from june to december the assumption change for cost sharing with retirees is the primary cause for the million increase in postretirement and other benefits expense in compared to the unrecognized prior service cost for the postretirement and other benefit plans of million is primarily due to changes in the company s substantive commitments with respect to retiree cost sharing for the company s medical plans 
at december   the company had unrecognized net losses of million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement and other benefits plan 
the unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by changes in previous years related to discount rates  asset return differences and actual health care costs 
because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa  the company is not required to recognize these gains and losses in the period that they occur 
instead  if the gains and losses exceed a corridor defined in the accounting literature  the company amortizes the excess over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan 
changes in actual asset returns experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
actual asset returns experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum pension liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset recorded as an intangible asset  to the extent the company has unrecognized prior service costs  with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  net of tax 
an additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in for the three pension plans as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for each of those plans as of the measurement date 
the company s aml before the effect of income taxes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
since  federal regulators have considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at fulfilling the goals of the act and this process is continuing through numerous proceedings currently before the federal communications commission fcc and the federal courts 
although the act called for a deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while opening up opportunities for new competitive entrants and services with minimal regulation such as cable modem broadband providers and voice over internet protocol voip providers 
while cincinnati bell has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband service  internet access and out of territory competitive local exchange services  the majority of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local exchange services 
the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition in our market and the timing and outcome of the fcc s decisions and any appeals from those decisions 
intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
the fcc has opened a proceeding to consider various plans that have been proposed for revising the disparate intercarrier compensation system into a unified regime that treats all traffic in a uniform manner 
the outcome of this proceeding could have significant impacts on all carriers and will probably be phased in over a five to ten year period 
this proceeding impacts the switched access and end user components of cbt s revenue 
reciprocal compensation although the topic of reciprocal compensation will ultimately be addressed within the broader intercarrier compensation proceeding mentioned above  the fcc adopted an order which in the short term directly impacted the rules for the termination of isp bound dial up traffic 
the previous rules capped the total number of minutes that could be compensated growth cap and limited compensation to markets in which the carriers previously exchanged traffic new markets rule 
the fcc s new order eliminated the growth cap and the new markets rule 
this decision could increase the amount that cbt must pay to clecs with which it exchanges such traffic 
however  several carriers have sought reconsideration of the decision by the fcc and other carriers have filed appeals with the federal court 
voip during the fcc declared that voip services are interstate services and purported to preempt state regulation 
in addition  the fcc has considered several petitions asking it to rule on whether and under what circumstances voice services utilizing internet protocol ip are subject to access charges 
it has ruled that peer to peer internet voice services that do not use the public switched telephone network pstn are not subject to access charges 
separately  it has ruled that services that originate and terminate on the pstn but employ ip in the middle are subject to access charges 
the fcc is still considering other voip petitions  including one that seeks to exempt from access charges calls that originate using voip  but terminate on the pstn 
in addition  the fcc is considering a broader rulemaking proceeding to determine the regulatory status of ip enabled services generally 
special access in early the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  cbt s special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
the new proceeding is examining the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 
universal service the federal universal service fund is currently funded via an assessment on all telecommunications carriers interstate end user revenue 
the fcc is currently considering alternatives to this method of funding 
some of the alternatives being considered include expanding the base to include intrastate revenue or switching to an assessment based on connections and telephone numbers 
any such alteration could result in a change in the manner in which carriers recover their contributions from end users 
unbundled network elements in early  the fcc rewrote its unbundled network element rules in response to the federal court s remand of the previous rules 
the latest rules have no significant impact on cbt 
however  the elimination of unbundled circuit switching  and thus the une platform une p  required cbet to migrate its une p lines to alternative arrangements by march  and or to negotiate with the underlying ilec for continued provision of une p  which cbet did pursuant to a commercial agreement 
this is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on cbet since cbet had already planned to migrate the majority of its customers to its own switching facilities 
broadband internet access in an order adopted in the third quarter of  the fcc provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband internet access as a non regulated information service comparable treatment to cable modem internet access or as a regulated telecommunications service 
each option has associated costs and benefits that must be weighed in light of a carrier s current mix of existing services and new services the carrier may be contemplating offering in the future 
fcc inquiry regarding safeguards to protect customer proprietary network information cpni by letter dated march   the enforcement bureau of the fcc directed the company to provide information and documents necessary for the bureau to determine whether the company has implemented adequate safeguards and or taken appropriate security measures pursuant to section of the communications act of  as amended  to protect cpni 
the company is cooperating with the inquiry and plans to submit its response within the time period specified in the letter 
the company believes that the fcc has requested similar information from other telecommunications providers 
state because cbt generates the majority of its revenue from the operation of its public switched telephone network  its financial results follow no particular seasonal pattern 
cbt does derive a significant portion of its revenue from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory overview and approval 
in both ohio and kentucky  cbt operates under alternative regulation plans in which cbt cannot increase the price of basic local services and is subject to restrictions on its ability to increase the price of other related services 
in return  cbt is not subject to an earnings cap or recapture in ohio  as it would if regulated under a traditional regulatory plan based upon a targeted rate of return 
cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans since during which price increases and enhanced flexibility for a limited number of services have partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
in june  cbt adopted a new alternative regulation plan in ohio  which although similar to its previous plan  gives cbt the option to remain in the alternative regulation plan indefinitely 
also  cbt s new plan requires the local segment to operate as a clec in service areas outside of cbt s traditional ilec franchise area 
for approximately the past six years  cbt has offered local services  primarily on its own facilities based network  to ohio communities contiguous to its ilec territory 
in dayton  the local segment has provided its voice services offering using the port loop transport combination une p as well as the une l regulatory format 
on february   the fcc released its unbundled network elements order on remand which will effectively abolish une p as a regulated service and has left each carrier to negotiate new pricing arrangements under commercial agreements 
the local segment has entered into such an agreement  however  it does not expect the profitability of its dayton local operations to change substantially because the segment had planned to migrate the provisioning of service to une l  which is a more economic service delivery model as the segment has gained customers 
statutory changes enacted by the ohio general assembly in august give the public utilities commission of ohio the puco the authority to provide ilecs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives house bill 
during  the puco will adopt rules in accordance with the new law to establish more detailed requirements for ohio ilecs to apply for this additional pricing flexibility 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r which is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb this statement eliminates the intrinsic value method as an allowed method for valuing stock options granted to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense was generally not recognized for the issuance of stock options 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
commencing january  the company will recognize compensation expense for new options granted based on their fair value  and compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to be material in as all of the previously issued stock options are fully vested as of december   and the company does not expect to grant a material amount of stock option awards during in april  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows  and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities  while maintaining low overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations over time  the company uses both fixed and variable rate debt and utilizes derivative financial instruments 
because the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from its credit facility and changes in current rates compared to that of its fixed rate debt  the company sometimes employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these fluctuations and its total interest expense over time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements  a particular type of derivative financial instrument  involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between the company and its counterparties in the transactions and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the net result of the fixed and variable rate percentages to be charged on the swap s notional amount 
in june  the company entered into a series of fixed to variable interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million that qualify for fair value hedge accounting 
in february and march  in conjunction with the company s refinancing plan  an additional million in fixed to variable interest rate swaps were executed which were also designated as fair value hedges
