there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those stated above in item a 
under the headings risk factors cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors  as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing  and we assume no obligation to update such statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
overview costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available  have the largest research department in the industry  provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors 
we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information 
our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease  comparable sales information  tenant information  information about properties for sale  information for clients web sites  information about industry professionals and their business relationships  analytic information  data integration  property marketing and industry news 
we completed our initial public offering in july and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used those net proceeds to fund the geographic and service expansion of our business  including three strategic acquisitions  and to expand our sales and marketing organization 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the acquisitions of comps 
com  inc comps and property intelligence plc property intelligence 
in november  we completed an additional follow on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from these public offerings for development and distribution of new services  expansion of existing services across our current markets  geographic expansion in the us and international markets  strategic acquisitions  working capital and general corporate purposes 
from through the beginning of  we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc in san francisco in in august  we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january  we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  inc and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison research  inc in february  we acquired comps  a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information 
in november  we acquired first image technologies  inc first image 
in september  we expanded further into portland  oregon through the acquisition of certain assets of napier realty advisors d b a real net real net 
in january  we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of london based property intelligence 
in may  we expanded into tennessee through the acquisition of peer market research  inc peermark  and in june  we extended our coverage of the united kingdom through the acquisition of scottish property network spn 
in september  we strengthened our position in denver  colorado through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of realcomp  inc  a local comparable sales information provider 
in january  we acquired national research bureau nrb  a leading provider of us shopping center information 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 
since our inception  the growth of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of our services and the establishment of operating regions throughout the united states  which resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis until throughout and  we experienced a rapid expansion in the number of services that we offered and the number of regions in which we operated 
by the beginning of  we had substantially established a national platform of service offerings in us metropolitan markets 
from through  we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs  in order to reduce operating losses and become profitable in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our net income increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net income in included a one time income tax benefit of million  which was the result of the release of a substantial portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we increased ebitda net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization by million from million in to million in our use of non gaap financial measures is discussed later in this section 
prior to  our calculations of weighted average outstanding shares for basic and diluted net loss per share were identical because stock options that would have had an anti dilutive effect on the calculation were properly excluded from the calculation 
we achieved net income for the years ended december    and and as a result our calculation of weighted average outstanding shares for diluted net income per share included the effect of any dilutive stock options  which are any outstanding stock options that have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for the period presented 
we expect that our diluted net income per share will be lower than our basic net income per share for any future periods in which we report net income  due to the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options 
our current expansion plan began in and included entering new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expanding the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us and us markets during and as of february  our expansion into the new markets is complete 
in addition  in january  we acquired nrb and announced the launch of a major expansion effort into real estate information for retail properties 
our current retail expansion plan has caused and will continue to cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of the revenues that we expect to generate from these new markets and services  reducing our earnings growth 
we expect revenue to grow over revenue as a result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform  as well as successful cross selling of our services to our existing customer base  and continued geographic expansion 
we expect ebitda for our existing core platform to continue to grow principally due to growth in revenue and we expect overall ebitda to increase from ebitda including stock option compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the ebitda did not include stock option compensation expense 
in addition to our current planned retail expansion  we may continue further geographic expansion in the united states  we may seek additional international geographic expansion or we may seek to expand our services 
any future significant expansion could reduce our profitability and significantly increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings in existing markets to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business  it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional and focus services  currently generate approximately of our total revenues 
our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  our contract renewal rate was over 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually on october st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future 
the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
this included an income tax benefit of approximately million that was recognized in our results from operations 
we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately million as additional paid in capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately  for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  from the year through the year our decision to release the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset was based on our expectation that we will recognize taxable income from operations in the future  which will enable us to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe our expectation that we will recognize taxable income in the future is supported by our increase in net earnings over the last three years  our revenue growth  our renewal rates with our existing customers  and our business model  which permits some control over future costs 
we will continue to evaluate our expectation of future taxable income during each quarter 
if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets  then we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately to 
for the next several years  however  we expect the majority of our taxable income to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 
accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we currently account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date 
we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
had been applied 
effective for the fiscal quarters beginning after december   pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment  the company will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r in  however  the company currently expects to incur approximately to million for stock option compensation expense in in  we issued restricted stock  instead of stock options  to our senior officers and employees  as a result of which we recorded additional compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
we plan to continue the use of alternative stock based compensation for our senior officers  directors and employees  which may include among other things  restricted stock grants  which typically will require us to record additional compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations and reduce our net income 
the company currently expects to incur approximately million for restricted stock compensation expense in non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired tradenames 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by only using a non gaap measure to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

accounting treatment 
all of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for using purchase accounting 
the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated primarily to acquired database technology  customer base and goodwill 
the acquired database technology for each acquisition is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the customer base for each acquisition  which consists of one distinct intangible asset composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over years 
goodwill will not be amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of peermark  spn  realcomp and nrb have been consolidated with our results since the respective dates of acquisition 
the operating results of each of peermark  spn realcomp  and nrb are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements  and accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of the acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  from december  to december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million  principally as a result of ebitda of million  interest income  and proceeds of million from exercise of stock options  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and other assets of approximately million  cash used for the purchase of nrb  and changes in working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts partially offset by an increase in income before income taxes as a result of revenue growth  resulting growth in gross margin and income from operations and interest income 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the increase in net purchases and sales of short term investments and increased cash used in acquisitions offset by decreased purchases of property and equipment and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the higher net cash produced by financing activities in over is due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands and total thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations amounts do not include current purchase obligations that may be renewed on the same or different terms or terminated by us or a third party 
on february   the company entered into an operating lease agreement  pursuant to which the company has agreed to lease approximately  square feet of office space located in columbia  maryland 
the lease has an initial term of months and an initial base rent of per rentable square foot per year 
additionally  the company has a conditional option both to terminate the lease approximately five years after commencement of the initial term  and to renew the lease for an additional five year period after expiration of the initial term 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million  including expenditures of approximately million related to building photography costs and the purchase of field research vehicles and equipment in connection with our market expansion  and the remaining million related to costs of supporting our existing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures in totaling approximately to million in connection with investments in assets required to support our existing operations and our geographic and retail expansion  including building photography  initial databases and communications  and measuring  photographic and computer equipment 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate taxable income from operations and be able to realize tax benefits arising from use of our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax we will owe on this taxable income 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with these future tax benefits because we were not certain we would generate taxable income in the future 
the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
this included an income tax benefit of approximately million that was recognized in our results from operations 
we also recognized a tax benefit of approximately million as additional paid in capital for our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions for stock options 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately  for certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  million  which expire  if unused  from the year through the year for the foreseeable future  we expect to record income tax expense on our results from operations at an effective rate of approximately to 
for the next several years  however  we expect the majority of our taxable income to be absorbed by our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we expect our cash payments for taxes to be limited primarily to federal alternative minimum taxes and to state income taxes in certain states 
inflation may affect the way we operate in the u 
s and the uk in general  we believe that over time we are able to increase the prices of our services to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs

we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
