item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
factors affecting comparability during and  we owned several properties through foreclosure  classified as real estate owned held and used  subject to sales contracts and held for sale 
as a result of certain circumstances during  we reclassified some of these assets from held for sale to held and used 
although prior period results have been reclassified as held and used  we have recorded greater depreciation expense and recognized property level mortgage interest in the current year see real estate owned below 
during march  we issued million of floating rate preferred securities through a subsidiary 
due to the mandatory redemption feature of these securities  the payments or accruals of dividends and other amounts to be paid to the holders of these securities are reported as interest costs 
as a result  these interest costs are classified as interest distributions to preferred shareholders of subsidiary subject to mandatory repurchase 
there were no such interest costs in prior periods 
during september  the gnma certificate and mezzanine loan investments relating to one property were paid off prior to the maturity date 
this pay off resulted in significantly higher levels of fees earned and gain on redemption 
investment activity during the years ended december  we made the following investments in thousands weighted weighted weighted average average average interest interest interest amount rate amount rate amount rate debt securities    mezzanine loans    bridge loans   first mortgage loans   total    during and  the composition of our investment portfolio shifted to include a larger proportion of debt securities and  especially in  a larger number of variable rate mezzanine loans particularly related to condo conversion properties 
the increase in our debt security investments allows us to increase our ability to obtain leverage on those assets to allow further investment and the timing of cash flows related to the liquidation of other assets in our portfolio 
the change in our investment strategy to expand into asset classes beyond traditional multifamily housing has increased our variable rate asset base and increased the weighted average yield on our portfolio 
results of operations the following is a summary of our operations in thousands change change vs vs total revenues    total expenses    total other income    net income    the substantial growth in our annual revenues and other income in both and resulted primarily from increases in investment activity  as well as fees received as a result of an early paydown of one gnma certificate and mezzanine loan 
expenses also increased for these periods due to the increase in property operations  interest expenses and depreciation costs for real estate owned  financing costs particularly due to higher interest rates  and advisory fees due to higher profits and an increased asset base 
revenues changes in components of our revenues were as follows change of total of total of total change vs 
vs revenues revenues revenues interest income debt securities mortgage loans notes receivable revenue bonds temporary investments fees related to the prepayment of assets  other revenues subtotal rental income total revenues at december  we had the following investments exclusive of real estate owned weighted weighted weighted average average average carrying interest carrying interest carrying interest amount of total rate amount of total rate amount of total rate debt securities    mortgage loans    notes receivable    revenue bonds    total    interest income from debt securities increased during both and  primarily due to the continued advances on an existing gnma certificate and the purchase of eight new fnma certificates during the fourth quarter of and eleven new fnma certificates during  partially offset by the repayment of one gnma certificate in and two in the decrease in the weighted average interest rate on debt securities during these periods was primarily due to the rising interest rates on mortgage loans  as mortgage interest rates rise  interest rates on debt securities tend to decrease 
interest income from mortgage loans decreased in  primarily due to the reduction of interest received from certain foreclosed properties due to the reclassification of these assets to real estate owned 
the balance increased significantly in primarily due to funding of three mezzanine loans during the second half of and the funding of seven mezzanine loans during  many of which related to condominium conversions 
the increase in the weighted average interest rates on mortgage loans during these periods was primarily due to the increase in market interest rates 
interest income from notes receivable decreased during both and  primarily due to the payoff of several notes during these periods  partially offset by the funding of one new note receivable 
the balance also decreased during due to the default of required debt service payments from foreclosed properties 
fees related to prepayment of assets increased during primarily due to the recognition of fees relating to an early payoff of a gnma certificate and a mezzanine loan during the third quarter of other revenues increased for  primarily due to the recognition of a commitment fee and a non refundable due diligence fee during no such fees were recorded in rental income increased during primarily due to the purchase of the first mortgage on one property in the real estate owned portfolio in february subsequent to the purchase  we recorded income from property operations 
there was no income from operations during rental income increased during primarily due to the foreclosure of the concord properties during the later half of during  there was a full year of income recorded for operations of these properties 
expenses changes in components of our expenses in  and were as follows of total of total of total change change vs revenues vs revenues revenues interest distributions to preferred shareholders general and administrative fees to advisor amortization and other subtotal property operations depreciation mortgage interest for real estate owned  held and used total expenses at december   excluding mortgages on real estate owned  we had total debt of approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of per year  including the effect of our swap agreement 
at december   we had a comparable balance of approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of per year 
the increase in the weighted average interest rate is due to steady increases in market interest rates during and interest expense increased for both and  primarily due to the increased borrowings on the repurchase facilities stemming from an increased investment base and the increase in interest rates during and distributions to preferred shareholders were recorded following the issuance of the securities in march there were no such securities outstanding during or general and administrative expenses increased for both and  primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to foreclosed properties  an increase in accounting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and an increase in excise taxes due to undistributed taxable income 
fees to advisor increased for both and  due to higher overhead costs and asset management fees because of expansion of our business and an increased asset base during and in addition  during  we incurred incentive management fees based on the increase in earnings  which resulted primarily from fees related to the early payoff of a gnma certificate and mezzanine loan 
property operations represent all non interest costs at the property level on all of our real estate owned held and used properties 
mortgage interest for real estate owned held and used increased during  due to debt service costs associated with a million mortgage on the concord portfolio see real estate owned below 
depreciation expense increased during both and  due to a higher base of depreciable real estate owned in both and in  we began depreciating the concord portfolio and in  we began depreciating autumn creek 
in both years  the initial amount of depreciation included retroactive amounts to capture depreciation from the respective foreclosure dates 
real estate owned during  we reclassified some of our investments in foreclosed properties as real estate owned held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and recognized income from the operations of these properties 
as a result of these circumstances  we have reclassified certain prior year amounts relating to the income recognition of our real estate owned portfolio to conform to current year presentation 
during  we had three properties classified as real estate owned subject to sales contracts  as the sale of these properties did not constitute a sale in accordance with gaap 
after the properties were refinanced during december  we reclassified these properties on our consolidated balance sheets as real estate owned held and used  we recorded depreciation on the properties in  as well as retroactively for the period since foreclosure 
we recognize income associated with a million mezzanine loan our remaining economic interest in the properties as rental income  property operations and mortgage interest on real estate owned held and used on our consolidated statements of income 
during  we had one property classified as real estate owned held for sale 
as a sale for this property could not be accomplished before december  we also reclassified the property as held and used  we recorded depreciation on the property in  as well as retroactively for the period since foreclosure 
we recognize income from the property as rental income and property operations on real estate owned held and used on our consolidated statements of income 
during  we sold the plaza at san jacinto property to an unaffiliated third party for approximately its carrying value 
impact of hurricanes during the year ended december  during  three major hurricanes struck the southern united states 
six of our investments  secured by properties in texas  were affected by hurricane rita 
the damage to these properties was minor and therefore it is expected that we have no financial exposure in this matter 
there were no properties affected by hurricane katrina or by hurricane wilma 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  represents net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  excluding depreciation and amortization related to real property and including funds from operations for unconsolidated joint ventures calculated on the same basis 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our management considers ffo a supplemental measure of operating performance  and  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities  and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures  and to fund other cash needs 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo for the years ended december   and in thousands net income    add back depreciation of real property   ffo    cash flows from operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding basic    diluted    there was no depreciation recorded on real estate owned in since not all companies calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we expect that cash generated from our investments  as well as our borrowing capacity  will meet our needs for short term liquidity and will be sufficient to pay all expenses and distributions to our shareholders in amounts sufficient to retain our reit status in the foreseeable future 
in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  as amended  we must  among other things  distribute at least of our taxable income 
we believe that we are in compliance with the reit related provisions of the code 
we finance our investing activity primarily through borrowing from various facilities at short term rates 
at december   we had approximately million available to borrow  contractually  under our debt facilities without exceeding limits imposed by debt covenants and our declaration of trust 
from time to time  we may also issue common shares or other equity to fund investing activity 
during  our subsidiary issued million of variable rate preferred securities 
the proceeds received were used to purchase fnma certificates 
we have capacity to raise approximately million of additional funds by issuing either common or preferred shares pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
if market conditions warrant  we may seek to raise additional funds for investment through further offerings  although the timing and amount of such offerings cannot be determined at this time 
we are currently exploring funding the further expansion of our investment platform through the use of collateralized debt obligations cdos 
a real estate cdo is a capital markets transaction in which the holder of various forms of real estate debt instruments finances those assets by selling bonds backed by the assets 
the assets can be floating or fixed rate  and may include first mortgages  subordinate participations in first mortgages  bridge loans  mezzanine loans  cmbs  and trust preferred stock 
the assets would be aggregated on our consolidated balance sheets and would later be securitized 
the cdo execution would enable us to lower our cost of capital significantly  which in turn would make us more competitive in the lending marketplace 
it is anticipated that our origination activity would begin to increase during the first quarter of and we would access the securitization market in the second quarter of  although there are no assurances that we will proceed with such a program or that such a program will be successful 
in order to finance this increased volume in investments before securitization occurs  we expect to enter into a warehouse facility with a major financial institution 
the proposed terms of this facility contemplate a credit limit of up to million  priced at a spread to libor 
this facility will mature when the cdo is entered into  after which  new facilities will be negotiated to finance any investments to be placed in additional cdos 
as with our proposed investment strategy changes  there is no assurance that this facility will close in summary of cash flows during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million 
operating cash flows improved by approximately million primarily due to higher earnings 
an increase in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and an increase in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to an increase in proceeds received from repurchase and warehouse facilities used for purchases of mortgage loans and debt securities 
during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the net change in cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million 
operating cash flows improved by million primarily due to higher cash earnings and favorable variances in timing of receivables collected 
a decrease in net cash used in investing activities approximately million and a corresponding decrease in net cash provided by financing activities approximately million were due to a higher level of investing activity in debt securities  mortgage loans  and mezzanine and bridge loans during the period 
the lower level of investing in corresponded to the decrease in net borrowings 
liquidity requirements after december  during february  dividends of approximately million per share  which were declared in december  have been paid to common shareholders 
we are not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
dividends the following table outlines our total dividends and return of capital amounts  determined in accordance with gaap  for the year ended december  in thousands total dividends    return of capital amount  per share 


percent of total dividends application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events which cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statement o valuation of investments in debt securities  o assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes  o classification of mezzanine loan investments  and o classification and valuation of real estate owned 
valuation of investments in debt securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  provides guidance on determining the valuation of investments owned 
the initial classification of our investments in the available for sale category rather than as held to maturity is due to our intent to sell these securities if the terms of a particular offer are deemed favorable to us 
we have sold these securities in the past and from time to time  we may look to sell these securities in the future if it is opportunistic for us to do so 
because of this classification  we must carry our investments at estimated fair value 
gnma and fnma dus certificates are relatively liquid investments 
we use third party quoted market prices as our primary source of valuation information 
assessment of impairment of mortgage loans and notes sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  establishes standards regarding impairment issues related to our mortgage loans and notes receivable 
our portfolio of mortgage loans and notes is periodically evaluated for impairment to establish appropriate loan loss reserves  if necessary 
our advisor has a credit review committee which meets monthly and reviews the status of each loan and note and maintains a watch list of loans including loans for which we have issued guarantees for which the underlying property may be experiencing construction cost overruns  delays in construction completion  occupancy shortfalls  lower than expected debt service coverage ratios  or other matters which might cause the borrower to be unable to make scheduled interest and principal payments 
if a loan is experiencing difficulties  members of this credit committee work with the borrower to try to resolve the issues  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of our management  it is determined that it is probable that we will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan or note would be deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
as of december   our management had determined that no loan required a loss reserve 
classification of mezzanine loan investments our mezzanine loan investments bear interest at fixed or variable rates  and some also include provisions that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  our management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate  using the guidance contained in the third notice to practitioners issued by the aicpa 
although the accounting methodology does not affect our cash flows from these investments  this determination affects the balance sheet classification of the investments as well as the classification  timing and amounts of reported earnings 
accounting for the investment as real estate is required if we expect that the amount of profit  regardless of its nature  is over percent of the property s total expected residual profit 
if a mezzanine investment were accounted for as an investment in real estate  our consolidated balance sheets would show the underlying property and its related senior debt if such debt were not also held by us  and our consolidated statements of income would include the property s rental revenues  operating expenses and depreciation 
if we expect to receive less than percent of the property s residual profit  then loan or joint venture accounting is applied 
loan accounting is appropriate o if the borrower has a substantial equity investment in the property  o if we have recourse to substantial assets of the borrower  o if the property is generating sufficient cash flow to service normal loan amortization  or o if certain other conditions are met 
under loan accounting  we recognize interest income as earned and additional interest from participations as received 
joint venture accounting would require that we only record our share of the net income from the underlying property 
our management must exercise judgment in making the required accounting determinations 
for each mezzanine arrangement  we project total cash flows over the loan s term and our share in those cash flows  and consider the borrower s equity  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to us over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making an assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  we have determined that all mezzanine investments should be accounted for as loans 
classification and valuation of real estate owned the accounting for the foreclosure  ownership and subsequent sale of real estate is governed by o sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  o sfas no 
 accounting for the sale or disposal of long lived assets  and o sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
during  we exercised our rights under subordinated promissory notes and other documents to take possession of certain real estate collateral 
we have also purchased the first mortgage loans on all of the respective properties  except for autumn creek  and acquired the real estate at foreclosure auctions 
three of the properties were subsequently sold  although the transaction did not meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 despite the fact that the purchaser later secured permanent first mortgage financing 
when a loan is in the process of foreclosure  it is our policy to initially reclassify the balance of the loan into real estate owned held for sale at the lower of fair value of the real estate  less estimated disposal costs or the carrying amount of the loan  and to cease accrual of interest 
we obtain independent appraisals of all foreclosed real estate to assist management in evaluating property values 
to date  no losses have been recorded upon foreclosure 
it is our intent to sell foreclosed properties within a short time period 
due to the held for sale classification  we do not initially depreciate the properties 
if we do not sell a property or do not meet sale criteria within the permissible timeframe for held for sale classification  we reclassify the property into real estate owned held and used or subject to sales contract categories and account for it as an operating asset 
depreciation is recorded for the asset including a retroactive adjustment for the full period that the property was classified as real estate owned held for sale 
income from property operations is recorded provided realization and collectibility of the amounts are considered likely 
likewise  interest income on notes receivable for properties sold that do not meet the criteria for sale recognition is recorded to the extent that collectibility is considered likely 
this accounting for real estate owned requires substantial judgment as to the fair value of the assets  the likelihood of collecting income and our ability to sell the properties 
as of december   we believe that the amounts reported are fairly stated and realizable 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements we have no unconsolidated subsidiaries  special purpose off balance sheet financing entities  or other off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table reflects our maximum exposure and carrying amount as of december   for guarantees we have entered into maximum exposure carrying in thousands amount fnma loan program  these indemnification agreements relate to a program we initiated and have since discontinued 
we believe the risk of any cost associated with the indemnity agreement is minimal 
the maximum exposure amount is not indicative of any expected losses under the guarantees 
for full description of these guarantees  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations in conducting business  we enter into various contractual obligations 
details of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  are contained below 
payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years debt lines of credit repurchase facilities   warehouse facility   mortgage loan on real estate owned     preferred shares of subsidiary subject to mandatory repurchase   mortgage loan commitment with related party see note   standby and forward loan commitments   total      represents a first mortgage on properties we report as real estate owned held and used concord portfolio as a sale of the properties did not meet the criteria for sale recognition in accordance with gaap

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
as we already follow the fair value provisions set forth in sfas no 
 this statement is expected to have an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
there are no other new pending accounting pronouncements which we are required to adopt that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of our company 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect our income in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets net of credit losses and our borrowing costs 
although we are increasing our origination of variable rate loans  most of our assets generate fixed returns and have terms in excess of five years 
we fund the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have variable interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as weekly  monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence our net income 
our borrowings under repurchase and warehouse agreements bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow our management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings 
during march  upon our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  we entered into an interest rate swap in order to hedge against increases in the floating interest rate on our repurchase facilities 
the swap is a five year agreement with bank of america boa whereby we pay boa a fixed on a notional amount of million 
in return  boa pays us a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate on the same notional amount 
a possible risk of such swap agreements is the possible inability of boa to meet the terms of the contracts with us  however  there is no current indication of such an inability 
based on the million unhedged portion of million of borrowings outstanding at december   a change in libor would impact our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
however  as some of the interest income from our loans outstanding at december  is also based on libor  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows from such loans by approximately  the net effect of a increase in libor would therefore result in a reduction of our annual net income by approximately million 
in addition  an increase in libor could also impede the collections of interest on our variable rate loans  as there might not be sufficient cash flow at the properties to pay the increased debt service 
because the value of our debt securities fluctuates with changes in interest rates  rate fluctuations will also affect the market value of our net assets 
management s report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting the management of american mortgage acceptance company and its subsidiaries the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of trustees regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by  or under the supervision of  the company s principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  and effected by the company s board of trustees  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
