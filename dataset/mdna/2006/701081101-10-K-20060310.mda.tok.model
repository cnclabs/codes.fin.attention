item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview financial results for reflect the significant improvement over that we anticipated would result from strong market conditions  and from significantly reduced debt and interest costs associated with the achievement of our debt reduction goal 
demand has continued to grow  both domestically and internationally 
uncertainty over disruptions in supply of oil and gas has intensified due to continued geopolitical issues and  coupled with the impact of the tropical storms in the us  pushed the record high oil and gas prices of even higher in these market conditions resulted in increases in utilization and dayrates in most of our drilling segments and increased utilization and pricing in our rental tools operations during we anticipate that these market conditions will continue to positively impact our financial results for the foreseeable future 
gross margin more than doubled in  with a percent increase from domestic drilling  predominantly driven by higher dayrates  a percent increase from our rental tools business due both to increased activity and higher rates  and a percent increase in our international drilling segment  due primarily to increased utilization and expansion of management and labor service contracts 
we had gains on asset disposals of million due primarily to our latin america assets sale and insurance recoveries on damaged rigs and had million lower asset impairments than in we also reduced other income and expense by million  which includes interest and debt extinguishment expenses  and had a net million non cash benefit primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
these improvements resulted in net earnings of million in our domestic utilization was percent for overall  with utilization for our deep drilling barges at percent 
dayrates in this region increased percent 
we believe that domestic utilization will remain at current levels and that there is still upside potential for dayrates during utilization was also strong in both our international land and offshore drilling areas 
in mexico and new zealand  all of our land rigs operated substantially all of in papua new guinea utilization was percent  and our offshore international operations achieved percent utilization 
our rental tools segment  quail tools  continued to expand its us market share and margins throughout  and closed out with record revenues for the month of december 
demand has continued at high levels at each of our four facilities 
during  we surpassed our million debt reduction goal established at the end of our outstanding debt balance of million at december  was reduced to million outstanding as of december  the debt reduction goal was achieved primarily through the sale of assets  insurance proceeds from involuntary conversion of rigs and cash generated from operations over the last two years 
during  we reduced debt by million with proceeds from the sale of jackup rig  the sale of seven latin america land rigs and existing cash 
on december  we retired in full our outstanding senior notes  leaving us with two series of outstanding senior notes 
we have million face value of senior notes due october and million of senior floating rate notes due september the combined effective weighted average interest rate on all of our notes is currently 
outlook we expect continued strong results in as we grow the business with cash generated from enhanced operations and the million in net cash proceeds generated from the stock offering we completed in mid january as part of our plan for and beyond  we are currently constructing four land drilling rigs for use in international markets and one ultra deep drilling barge for use in the us gulf of mexico  and are converting workover barge rig into a deep drilling barge 
we also have expansions plans for our rental tools business beginning in mid  including the addition of a new location 
overall  in  we expect to increase capital expenditures to approximately million 
we recently announced the formation of a percent owned joint venture in saudi arabia to supply four new land rigs for a three year initial term drilling contract with saudi aramco 
the first rig is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of  with the three remaining rigs scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of although the initial period of this joint venture will not generate significant profits or cash flows  it is part of the strategic growth in targeted markets set forth in our five year plan 
we expect to account for our interest in this joint venture utilizing the equity method 

table of contents results of operations continued outlook continued in mexico  two land rigs have completed their contracted number of wells 
one rig has been contracted for work in the us and the second rig is currently being tendered in the us and various international markets 
the initial terms of our other five rigs expire in the first and second quarters of  and we expect that these rigs will be under new contracts shortly after the completion of wells under the existing contracts 
in our cis operations  rig was released from our tco contract in january and is being mobilized for work under a new contract in kazakhstan 
this rig should spud towards the end of the first quarter and work under this contract for at least one year 
barge rig in the caspian sea is drilling its third well and has options for additional wells that should keep it under contract for all of in turkmenistan  rigs and continue to drill under contract with calik enerji  as calik 
rig  which suffered damage in a well control incident in november  is undergoing repair and should return to operation in the fourth quarter of loss of hire revenues began after days and will continue into june rig  which had been stacked in indonesia  began mobilizing in february to bangladesh to drill two appraisal wells and has options for additional work 
we expect additional growth to come from project management  where we can leverage our engineering  safety and training expertise without significant capital expenditures 
during  we will achieve the benefit of a full year of operation for our orlan platform project in sakhalin island and papua new guinea o m contracts that either commenced or expanded services during the third and fourth quarters of we also began an o m contract in late utilizing a third party rig to perform workover operations in sakhalin island for enl 
we plan to aggressively pursue these types of management contracts throughout oil and gas price levels significantly impact exploration and production activity which in turn  impact both our contract drilling and rental tools revenues 
in us markets  drilling contracts are generally short term  which has allowed us to benefit from rising prices over the last two years 
to mitigate the risks from future changes in market conditions  we are negotiating longer term contracts in us markets when possible 
in international markets contracts are generally longer term  insulating us somewhat from short term price fluctuations 
over extended periods  however  international market conditions typically follow the demand for oil 
international markets also present the challenges of foreign regulation and civil unrest  which we continually monitor and apply risk management strategies to minimize 
our strategic plan focuses on leveraging our significant international experience  safety record  training  preventive maintenance programs and project management expertise  along with our innovative rig designs to help maintain higher utilization in periods of reduced drilling activity by being the contractor of choice 
our rigs are also subject to damage or destruction from well control  weather related incidents  acts of violence and or civil unrest 
although we insure against these risks  recent industry damage caused by hurricanes in our us market and well control incidents in other areas  will significantly impact the cost and availability of insurance 
while we have been impacted by higher insurance costs and deductibles during the policy year  we expect substantial increases in insurance costs when our policy renewals occur in the third quarter of any increase in insurance costs can  over time  be factored into the dayrates we charge our customers 
we are also further refining our quality assurance  health  safety and environmental programs to help prevent future well control incidents 
our operating margins must also cover interest expense and income taxes 
we have reduced our interest and financial costs with the million reduction in debt and lowering of interest rates over the last two years 
we are currently reviewing our worldwide entity structure to determine if we can achieve a lower overall effective tax rate 
while we will accrue tax expense throughout  much of this expense will be non cash deferred taxes as we use our net operating loss carryforwards 
we also face delay  cost overrun and quality risks with regard to rigs under construction as a part of our strategic growth program 
we manage these risks through contractual provisions and project management strategies 
all major components have detailed specifications and construction standards that must be met before we accept delivery 
while demand and pricing may decline before the rigs are ready for use  the rigs under construction are premium rigs that we believe will be in demand regardless of the point in the business cycle 
obtaining qualified  trained crews to operate our rigs is increasingly difficult in us markets 
with our training programs and facilities  we are able to promote from within and will continue to emphasize these safety programs and our safety record to attract the necessary personnel 

table of contents results of operations continued outlook continued as reported in our year end earnings release dated february   we expect net income to be in the to per diluted share range 
included in this estimate is depreciation of approximately per diluted share  interest expense of approximately per diluted share and income taxes of per diluted share  including non cash deferred taxes of per diluted share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the loss from continuing operations for was million  whereas substantially all of the net income for the year ended december  was from continuing operations 
the income from discontinued operations was thousand for compared to million for revenues increased million to million in as compared to the increase is attributed to higher utilization and dayrates in the us barge operations  international land operations and our rental tools operations  quail tools

the gross margin amounts and gross margin percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
however  we monitor our business segments based on several criteria  including drilling and rental gross margin 
we believe this information is useful to our investors because it more closely tracks cash generated by segment 
such gross margin amounts are reconciled to our most comparable gaap measure as follows international us drilling drilling rental tools year ended december  dollars in thousands drilling and rental operating income depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin year ended december  drilling and rental operating income depreciation and amortization drilling and rental gross margin drilling and rental operating income drilling and rental revenues less direct drilling and rental operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization expense 

table of contents results of operations continued us drilling segment us drilling revenues increased million in to million due to higher utilization and dayrates 
as of december  the us drilling segment consisted of barge rigs  nine deep drilling barge rigs  four intermediate drilling barge rigs and six workover barge rigs 
despite the destruction caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  our us gulf of mexico rigs sustained no material damage or downtime 
barge rigs and returned to service in late november after undergoing minor repairs and scheduled maintenance 
barge rig  which turned over during a move from the path of hurricane dennis in july  sustained additional damage during hurricanes katrina and rita 
equipment on the rig was impaired by million 
average utilization for the barge rigs increased to percent from an average utilization during of percent 
average dayrates for the deep drilling barge rigs increased approximately  per day as compared to overall  rate increases on all barge rigs accounted for million of the revenue increase  and increased utilization accounted for approximately million of the increase 
as a result of higher dayrates and utilization  gross margins in the us drilling segment increased million to million 
international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to international land drilling revenues increased million to million and international offshore drilling revenues increased by million to million 
international drilling gross margins increased by million to million due to increased margins of million for international offshore and million for international land operations 
international land drilling results improved primarily due to our operations in mexico  the asia pacific countries of new zealand  papua new guinea and indonesia and on our sakhalin island o m contracts in the cis region 
we completed our sale of certain latin america assets previously operating in colombia  bolivia and peru in the third quarter of the remaining seven latin american land rigs were moved to mexico in the second and third quarters of and worked throughout under contract with halliburton de mexico halliburton 
revenues for these rigs increased by million to million due to the full year of operation in the asset sales and move of rigs  combined for a decrease in revenues for the referenced latin america countries of million 
in our asia pacific region  revenues increased by million as a result of percent utilization for all three rigs in new zealand compared to percent in and higher dayrates in  and utilization of percent in as compared to percent in for the two rigs in papua new guinea and higher dayrates in  partially offset by a million decline in bangladesh in as compared to due to the loss of our rig in a late june well control incident 
in our cis region  revenues increased by million due primarily to o m revenues under our sakhalin island orlan project of million 
construction on this rig was completed in the second quarter of and full crews under our contract began in late september o m revenues under our five year service contract on rig  sakhalin island increased by million to million 
revenues also increased million in turkmenistan due to the addition of a third rig that began drilling in the third quarter of  offset partially by a decrease in revenues on rig which suffered a well control incident in november due to the move of rig to turkmenistan in  revenues in russia declined by million in as the rig worked approximately six months in revenues also declined million on our tco contract as the scope of work under that contract was cut back with one tco owned rig released in late  one in the third quarter of and rates reduced on rig  which was released in early january international land gross margins increased million in when compared to the increase is primarily the result of a full year of operations in mexico million and increased activity  as noted previously  related to our orlan project in the cis region million and in new zealand million  papua new guinea million and indonesia million in the asia pacific region  offset partially by a decline related to our tco contract of million as previously discussed 
international offshore drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to the increase in revenues is attributable to a million increase in the caspian sea operation reflecting activation 
table of contents results of operations continued international drilling segment continued of barge rig in late  whereas it had been stacked during most of and a million increase for our offshore rig in mexico as a result of a full year of operation in our nigerian operations had a million increase in revenues due to less downtime in international offshore gross margins increased million in as compared to the increase is due to the operation of our rig in the caspian sea million as mentioned above  whereas the rig was stacked in costs to maintain the rig in a stacked condition were approximately million per quarter in and we also settled an assessment of duties  taxes and penalties for this rig with the customs control in mangistau  kazakhstan  in the third quarter of for million 
in nigeria  the gross margin increased million as our two rigs operated most of the year versus lower utilization in and costs to maintain the barges in stacked condition and increased insurance costs caused by losses incurred 
in addition  nigerian tax authorities assessed additional value added tax vat  resulting in a charge of million in the second quarter of mexico offshore gross margin increased by million in due to a full year of operations as compared to seven months in rental tools segment rental tools revenues increased million to million in the increase in revenues was attributable to a percent increase in rentals  a percent increase in rental tools sales  a percent increase in transportation revenues and a percent increase in repair revenues 
increases were achieved at all locations  including a million increase from our operations in new iberia  louisiana  million in victoria  texas  million in odessa  texas  million in evanston  wyoming and million from international sources 
gross margins increased million due to the increased volume of business and granting of fewer discounts off listed rental prices 
other financial data depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to asset sales completed during the year 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the increase is due to the accelerated vesting of certain restricted stock in including our portion of payroll related taxes  amortization on the issuance of additional restricted stock in the second quarter  higher compensation costs and higher staffing levels related to increased operating levels 
during  we recognized a provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets of million as compared to million in damage to barge rig in a july towing incident in preparation for a hurricane totaled approximately million 
we also wrote off the remaining million relating to premiums paid on a life insurance policy for robert l 
parker  chairman of the board and director 
during  we impaired two domestic workover barge rigs that were not marketable for million  impaired two rigs in the amount million in the asia pacific region  and recorded an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of all assets to net realizable value in latin america in advance of the sale of the assets 
during the second quarter of as required by gaap  we reclassified our latin america assets from discontinued operations to continuing operations as the assets had not sold within a year  or had a sale pending within a year 
we recognized a million charge to adjust the value of these assets to their fair value 
the million represents the depreciation that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used 
in addition  during we reserved million for an asset representing premiums paid in prior years on two split dollar life insurance policies for robert l 
parker 
the value of the asset was reduced and ultimately written off in relation to one of the policies as noted above 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gain on disposition of assets increased to million in as compared to million in the gain in was comprised of a million gain on sale of latin america assets  million gain on the well control insurance proceeds related to rig in bangladesh and other miscellaneous asset sales of million 
in  the million gain was comprised of million gain on the disposal of barge rig and million on sale of tubulars and scrap equipment 

table of contents results of operations continued other financial data continued interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the reduction of million of our outstanding debt balance in  the full year benefit from debt reductions and lower interest rates 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  we are reporting the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives currently in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash increase in the fair value of the derivative positions of million  as compared to a decrease in the fair value of the derivative position of million in loss on extinguishment of debt was million in compared to million in  as we reduced outstanding debt and exchanged higher interest rate debt for lower interest rate debt in both years 
in february  we repurchased million of our senior notes with the proceeds received from the sale of jackup rig and cash on hand  recognizing an expense of million for the percent redemption price on the repurchase of the notes and capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the notes 
in april  we issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at a premium 
the offering price of percent of the principal amount resulted in gross proceeds of million 
the million premium is recognized as long term debt and is being amortized over the term of the notes 
the additional notes were issued under an indenture dated october   under which million in aggregate principal amount of notes in the same series were previously issued 
on the same date that we issued the million additional senior notes  we issued a redemption notice for million of our senior notes at the redemption price of percent  resulting in a million loss on the extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of during the third quarter of we redeemed million of our senior notes at a premium of million using proceeds from the sale of our latin american assets 
on december   we retired the remaining million of our senior notes with cash on hand at a premium of million 
we have a percent interest in two joint ventures  which are included in our consolidated financial statements  and therefore we recognized minority interest income of million in and minority interest expense of million in income tax benefit from continuing operations is million and consists of us federal current tax expense of million and us federal deferred tax benefit of million  current foreign tax expense of million and foreign deferred tax expense of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income tax expense from continuing operations consisted of foreign tax expense of million 
foreign taxes decreased million in due primarily to a reduction of taxes in kazakhstan and papua new guinea offset by an increase in taxes related to the sale of the latin american rigs and start up of the orlan project in russia 
our effective income tax rates for financial reporting purposes were approximately percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax of percent is lower than due primarily to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the us the valuation allowance was originally recorded in accordance with gaap as an offset to our deferred tax assets  which consisted primarily of nol carryforwards 
gaap requires us to recognize a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that we could realize the benefit of the nol carryforwards and deferred tax assets in future periods 
having returned to profitability in  we now expect that earnings performance should allow us to benefit from the nol carryforwards  and therefore  the previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required 
the valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset benefit was million resulting from the reversal of the previously established valuation allowance of million and net deferred tax assets and tax benefit from tax return filings 
the reduction in foreign taxes  net of federal benefit  in from relates to a federal tax deduction on actual foreign cash taxes paid versus accrued foreign taxes 
the increase in income tax on foreign corporate income in is due to the increase in earnings on our foreign corporations and the related recognition of us taxes on the earnings 
us taxes are provided on the earnings since we do not defer recognition of the foreign corporation s income under apb no

the increase in utilization accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenues 
average dayrates increased approximately  per day as compared to accounting for the remaining million of the revenues increase 
during the third quarter of  we upgraded barge rig enabling it to drill effectively in ultra deep shelf drilling 
the rig began drilling under a multi well program in late october at a significantly higher dayrate of approximately  per day  compared to the previous dayrate of approximately  per day 
as a result of higher dayrates and utilization  gross margins in the us drilling segment increased million to million 
gross margins during the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by million for the move of barge rig from nigeria to the us gulf of mexico 
international drilling segment international drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to international land drilling revenues increased million to million offset by a reduction in international offshore drilling revenues of million to million 
international drilling gross margins decreased by million to million due almost entirely to reduced activity in the international offshore barge rigs 
international land drilling utilization increased in all regions except the latin america countries of colombia  bolivia and peru 
during the second and third quarters of  we moved seven land rigs which had been located in colombia  bolivia and argentina to mexico to begin a two year drilling contract for halliburton contributing million in revenues 
in our asia pacific region  revenues increased by million as a result of new drilling contracts in bangladesh  new zealand and papua new guinea when compared to in our cis region  revenues increased by million due to adding a second rig in turkmenistan in march of and from the full year impact of our five year o m contract on sakhalin island 
the sakhalin island contract commenced operations in june rig which had been operating in northern russia completed its drilling activities in june and was stacked for the remainder of the year

three land rigs remained in colombia as of the end of  but were sold in international land gross margins increased million in when compared to the increase was primarily the result of increased activity as noted above in the cis and asia pacific regions 
in addition  gross margins increased in the last half of as our seven land rigs began operations in mexico 
in when compared to  international land gross margins were negatively impacted by a million decrease in latin america operations  excluding mexico 
the decrease was primarily attributed to the standby situation in peru and the reduced activity in colombia 
international offshore drilling revenues decreased million to million in as compared to the decrease in revenues was attributable to a million decrease in the caspian sea operation and a million decrease in our nigeria operations  partially offset by increased revenues of million from our barge rig in mexico 
in november  our arctic class barge rig completed its initial four year contract and was demobilized and stacked throughout most of during the fourth quarter of  we signed a two well contract with options for an additional four wells 
barge rig began recognizing revenues under this new contract in late december in nigeria  revenues decreased significantly due to reduced utilization

in nigeria  lower utilization on the barge rigs caused reduced revenues in ongoing costs to maintain the barges in stacked condition and increased insurance cost caused by losses incurred  both negatively impacted gross margins 
in addition  nigerian tax authorities assessed additional vat  resulting in a charge of million in the second quarter of all of these factors combined to reduce the million gross margin in nigeria to breakeven in barge rig commenced operations in mexico in may under a new two year contract for pemex 
prior to receiving this contract  the barge rig had operated in the us gulf of mexico

both the new iberia  louisiana and victoria  texas operations experienced an increase in customer demand due to increased deep water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
all locations experienced increased customer demand and saw an expansion in customer base 
other financial data depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to limits on our capital expenditure program that were enacted until our debt reduction goal was met

management believes that this information is useful to our investors because it more closely tracks cash generated by segment 
such gross margin amounts are reconciled to our most comparable gaap measure as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands us jackup and platform drilling operating income loss depreciation and amortization drilling gross margin depreciation and amortization in accordance with sfas no

other matters business risks internationally  we specialize in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
our international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies and integrated service providers in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  we primarily drill in the transition zones of the us gulf of mexico for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is primarily dependent on the exploration and development activities of the companies that make up our customer base 
see item a for a detailed statement of risk factors related to our business 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we periodically evaluate our property  plant and equipment to ensure that the net carrying value is not in excess of the net realizable value 
we review our property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we consider a number of factors  including estimated undiscounted future cash flows  appraisals less estimated selling costs and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to fair value if the fair value is below net carrying value 
we recorded impairments to our long lived assets of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
we also recorded million of impairments to our discontinued operations assets in asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 

table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued impairment of goodwill 
we periodically assess whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill is impaired based generally on the estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation to which goodwill has been assigned is less than its carrying value  we deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if impairment should be recorded 
changes in dayrate and utilization assumptions used in the fair value calculations could result in fair value estimates that are below carrying value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
we also test for impairment based on events or changes in circumstances that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual analysis of goodwill at each year end 
our annual impairment tests of goodwill at years ending  and indicated that the fair value of operations to which goodwill relates exceeded the carrying values as of december   and  accordingly  no impairments were recorded 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability claims and health benefits 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 
accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make 
table of contents other matters continued critical accounting policies continued estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
as a result of our expected earnings performance which should allow us to benefit from the nol carryforwards  we have concluded that no valuation allowance is currently required 
we will reevaluate our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
we have provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our us and foreign subsidiaries as the earnings are not permanently reinvested 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as drilling progresses 
for meterage contracts  which are rare  we recognize the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
mobilization fees received and related mobilization costs incurred  if significant  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contract 
accounting for derivative instruments 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
established accounting and disclosure requirements for most derivative instruments and hedge transactions involving derivatives 
sfas no 
also requires formal documentation procedures for hedging relationships and effectiveness testing when hedge accounting is to be applied 
in  we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on our senior floating rate notes 
the interest rate swap agreements provide us with interest rate protection on the senior floating rate notes due we do not use hedge accounting treatment for these interest rate swap agreements as we determined that the hedges would not be highly effective as defined by sfas the ineffectiveness of the hedges is caused by embedded written call options in the interest rate swap agreements that do not exist in the notes 
accordingly  we recognize the volatility of the swap agreements on a mark to market basis in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash increase in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash decrease in the fair value of million 
these non cash expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as changes in fair value of derivative positions 
the non cash increase in fair value in is reported in the consolidated balance sheet as other assets  and the non cash decrease in fair value in is reported in other long term liabilities 
for additional information see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair market value adjustment of these swap agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for the three month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will decrease and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest swap agreements will increase  and we will record income 
we analyze the position of the swap agreements on a quarterly basis and record the mark to market impact based on the analysis 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no

 accounting for stock based compensation  and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services provided by employee to employer 
the statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity based compensation at the grant date 
the statement does not require a certain type of valuation model  and either a binomial or black scholes model may be used 
during the first quarter of  the sec approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this standard 
in april  the sec took further action to state that the provisions of sfas no 
r are now effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  for all non small business issuers 
as a result  we will not adopt this standard until the first quarter of our plans are to use the modified prospective application method as detailed in sfas no

in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
this fsp provides guidance on the definition and practical application of grant date as described in sfas no 
r 
the grant date is described as the date that the employee and employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award 
the other elements of the definition of grant date are the award must be authorized  the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and the employee is affected by changes in the company s stock price 
to determine the grant date  we are allowed to use the date the award is approved in accordance with its corporate governance requirements as long as the three elements described above are met 
furthermore  the recipient cannot negotiate the award s terms and conditions with the employer and the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short time period from the approval date 
we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with our adoption of sfas no 
r

r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  in response to issues financial statement preparers raised about the ability to calculate estimated tax benefit amounts that would have qualified if the entity had adopted sfas no 
for recognition purposes in as opposed to opting for the disclosure of the pro forma effects 
the position provides for a transition method that provides a proscribed computation for the estimated beginning balance of the related additional paid in capital pool and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the pool relating to employee option awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this position on our calculation upon adoption of sfas no 
r in in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  to clarify accounting for derivative instruments that are hybrid financial instruments with embedded derivatives  contain interest or principal only strips and for freestanding derivatives  further define embedded derivatives and clarify derivative related restrictions on special purpose entities 
this standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after september  and should not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements as a strategy to manage the floating rate risk on the million senior floating rate notes 
the first agreement  signed on august   fixed the interest rate on million at for a three year period beginning september  and terminating september  and fixed the interest rate on an additional million at for the two year period beginning september  and terminating september  in each case  an option to extend each swap for an additional two years at the same rates was given to the issuer  bank of america  na a second agreement  signed on september   fixed the interest rate on million at for the three month period beginning december  and terminating march  options to extend million at a fixed interest rate of for the six month period beginning march  and to extend million at a fixed interest rate of for the month period beginning march  and terminating september  were given to the issuer  bank of america  na in the first quarter of  bank of america na allowed these options to expire unexercised 
these swap agreements do not meet the hedge criteria in sfas no 
and are  therefore  not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is recognized currently in change in fair value of derivative positions on the consolidated statement of operations
