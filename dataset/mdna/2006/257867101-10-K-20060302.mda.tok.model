item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note  industry segment information  to the consolidated financial statements 
information related to the company s international operations is included in note  geographic area information  to the consolidated financial statements 
competition and strategy the environment is highly competitive in most of the company s product categories and geographic regions 
in addition to price  competition is also based on quality and ability to service the special needs of customers 
because the company believes there is excess and underutilized capacity in most of the printing markets served by the company  prices for the company s products and services are generally declining 
the company expects competition in most sectors served by the company to remain intense in coming years 
technological changes  including the electronic distribution of documents and data and the on line distribution and hosting of media content  present both risks and opportunities for the company 
the company s businesses seek to leverage distinctive capabilities to improve our customers communications  whether in paper form or through electronic communications 
the company s goal remains to help its customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time 
management believes that with the company s competitive strengths  including its broad range of complementary print related services  strong logistics capabilities  technology leadership  depth of management experience  customer relationships and economies of scale  the company can develop valuable  differentiated solutions for its customers 
management believes the acquisition of astron builds on these strengths and extends the company s distinctive capabilities into the higher growth document based business process outsourcing sector 
the company seeks to leverage its position and size to generate continued productivity improvements and enhance the value the company delivers to its customers 
the company also plans to enhance its products and services through strategic acquisitions that offer both increased breadth and depth of products and services 
to attain its productivity goals  the company has implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce its overall cost structure and improve the efficiency of its operations 
these initiatives include the restructuring and integration of operations  the expansion of internal cross selling  leveraging the company s global infrastructure  streamlining administrative and support activities  integrating common systems and the disposal of non core businesses 
future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities 
implementing such initiatives may result in future restructuring or impairment charges  which may be substantial 
management also reviews its portfolio of businesses on a regular basis to ensure it supports the company s long term strategic growth goals and that risks and opportunities are appropriately balanced 

table of contents seasonality advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end markets served by the publishing and retail services segment 
historically  the company s businesses that serve the magazine  catalog and retail and book businesses generate higher revenues in the second half of the year driven by increased advertising pages within magazines  and holiday catalog  retail and book volumes 
raw materials the primary raw materials the company uses in its print business are paper and ink 
the company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies  but it does not rely on any one supplier 
in addition  a substantial amount of paper used by the company is supplied directly by customers 
the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect the company s consolidated financial results 
prices for most paper grades increased during the impact of increasing prices on customer supplied paper is directly absorbed by customers  though higher prices may have an impact on those customers demand for printed product 
with respect to paper purchased by the company  the company has historically been able to raise its prices to cover a substantial portion of paper cost increases 
contractual arrangements and industry practice should support the company s continued ability to pass on paper price increases  but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable the company to successfully do so 
the company continues to monitor the impact of the rise in the price of crude oil and other energy costs 
the company believes its logistics business will continue to be able to pass a substantial portion of the increase in fuel prices directly to our customers in order to offset the impact of these increases 
however  the company generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on its manufacturing costs 
the company does not believe that the recent increase in energy prices has had a material impact on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
however  the company cannot predict the impact that energy price increases will have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
distribution the company s products are distributed to end users through the us or foreign postal services  through retail channels  or by direct shipment to customer facilities 
the company s logistics business manages distribution of most customer products in the us to maximize efficiency and reduce costs for customers 
postal costs are a significant component of many customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that the company s customers are willing to mail 
any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated annual financial results of operations and cash flows 
in january   a postal rate increase across most mail categories went into effect in the us postal rate increases can enhance the value of the company s logistics business to its customers  as the company is able to improve customers cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution 
customers for the year ended december   and  no customer accounted for or more of the company s consolidated net sales 
research and development the company has research facilities in grand island  new york and downers grove  illinois  that support the development and implementation of new technologies to better meet customer needs and improve operating efficiencies 
the company s cost for research and development activities is not material to the company s consolidated annual results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents environmental compliance the company s overriding objectives in the environmental  health and safety areas are to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and to create an injury free workplace 
the company believes that estimated capital expenditures for environmental controls to comply with federal  state and local provisions  as well as expenditures  if any  for its share of costs to clean hazardous waste sites that have received the company s waste  will not have a material effect on its consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employees as of december   the company had approximately  employees

table of contents item a 
risk factors the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
you should carefully consider all of these risks 
risks relating to the businesses of the company fluctuations in the costs of paper  ink  energy and other raw materials may adversely impact the company 
purchases of paper  ink  other raw materials  and energy represent a large portion of the company s costs 
increases in the costs of these inputs may increase the company s costs  and the company may not be able to pass these costs on to customers through higher prices 
increases in the costs of materials may adversely impact our customers demand for printing and related services 
the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate 
many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets  and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result 
a decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder the company s ability to collect amounts owed by customers 
in addition  such a decline could result in lower demand for the company s products and services 
the company may not be able to improve its operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions 
because the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive  the company must continue to improve its operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve its profitability 
although the company has been able to improve efficiency and reduce costs in the past  there is no assurance that it will continue to do so in the future 
in addition  the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up front costs to reduce workforce  close or consolidate facilities  or upgrade equipment and technology 
the company may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased revenues anticipated as a result of these acquisitions 
achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  including the acquisitions of astron  asia printers  poligrafia  charlestown  spencer and cmcs  will depend in part upon the company s ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
the integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges  and the company may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully 
in particular  the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from the day to day operations of the company 
the process of integrating operations may also cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the company s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the company or the acquired businesses 
employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt the businesses of the company or the acquired businesses 
the company s strategy is  in part  predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the company s products and services 
achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  the company may not be able to realize the anticipated cross selling opportunities  develop and market more comprehensive product and service offerings  or generate anticipated cost savings and revenue growth 

table of contents the company may be unable to hire and retain talented employees  including management 
the company s success depends  in part  on our general ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled employees 
the loss of a significant number of the company s employees or the inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain additional skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on the company 
although the company s manufacturing platform consists of many locations with a wide geographic dispersion  individual locations may encounter strong competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor 
many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than the company offers 
in addition  many members of the company s management have significant industry experience that is valuable to the company s competitors 
the company does  however  enter into non solicitation and non competition agreements with its executive officers  prohibiting them contractually from leaving and joining a competitor within a specified period 
if one or more members of our senior management team leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly  which could harm our business prospects and results of operations 
costs to provide health care and other benefits to the company s employees may increase 
the company provides health care and other benefits to both employees and retirees 
in recent years  costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the us economy 
if this trend in health care costs continues  the company s cost to provide such benefits could increase  adversely impacting the company s profitability 
declines in the general economic conditions may adversely impact the company s business 
in most of the company s businesses  demand for products and services is highly correlated with general economic conditions 
declines in economic conditions in the us or in other countries in which the company operates may therefore adversely impact the company s consolidated financial results 
because such declines in demand are difficult to predict  the company or the industry may have increased excess capacity as a result 
an increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for the company s products and services 
the overall business climate may also be impacted by wars or acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate or other countries 
such acts may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for the company s products and services 
there are risks associated with operations outside the united states 
the company has significant operations outside the united states 
revenues from the company s operations outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net sales for the year ended december  as a result  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the united states  including the impact of economic and political instability 
the company is exposed to significant risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which it does business 
although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non us subsidiaries and business units  fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into the company s financial statements 
to the extent revenues and expenses are not in the applicable local currency  the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the currency risk 
we cannot be sure  however  that the company s efforts at hedging will be successful 
there is always a possibility that attempts to hedge currency risks will lead to even greater losses than predicted 

table of contents risks related to our industry the highly competitive market for the company s products and industry consolidation may create adverse pricing pressures 
the markets for the majority of the company s product categories are highly fragmented and the company has a large number of competitors 
we believe that excess capacity in the company s markets have caused downward pricing pressure and increased competition 
in addition  consolidation in the markets in which the company competes may increase competitive pricing pressures 
the substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials may adversely affect our businesses 
electronic delivery of documents and data  including the online distribution and hosting of media content  offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents 
consumer acceptance of electronic delivery is uncertain  as is the extent to which consumers are replacing traditional reading of print materials with online hosted media content  and we have no ability to predict the rates of their acceptance of these alternatives 
to the extent that our customers accept these alternatives  many of our businesses may be adversely affected 
changes in the rules and regulations to which the company is subject may increase the company s costs 
the company is subject to numerous rules and regulations  including  but not limited to  environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations 
these rules and regulations may be changed by local  state or federal governments in countries in which the company operates 
changes in these regulations may result in a significant increase in the company s costs to comply 
compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to the company s workforce  increased cost for compensation and benefits  or investments in new or upgraded equipment 
changes in the rules and regulations to which our customers are subject may impact demand for the company s products and services 
many of the company s customers are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications  governing the form of such communications  and protecting the privacy of consumers 
changes in these regulations may impact customers business practices and could reduce demand for printed products and related services 
changes in such regulations could eliminate the need for certain types of printed communications altogether or such changes may impact the quantity or format of printed communications 
changes in postal rates and postal regulations may adversely impact demand for the company s products and services 
postal costs are a significant component of many of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that the company s customers are willing to mail 
any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in the advertising  retail  and capital markets may impact the demand for printing and related services 
many of the end markets in which our customers compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences 
the company cannot predict the impact that these changes will have on demand for the company s products and services 
such changes may decrease demand  increase pricing pressures  require investment in updated equipment and technology  or cause other adverse impacts to the company s business 
in addition  the company must monitor changes in our customers markets and develop new solutions to meet customers needs 
the development of such solutions may be costly  and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers 

table of contents item b 
unresolved staff comments the company has no unresolved written comments from the sec staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the exchange act 
item properties the company s corporate office is located in leased office space in chicago  illinois 
in addition  as of december   the company leases or owns us facilities  some of which have multiple buildings and warehouses and these us facilities encompass approximately million square feet 
the company leases or owns international facilities encompassing approximately million square feet in canada  latin america  europe and asia 
of the us and international manufacturing and warehouse facilities  approximately million square feet of space is owned  while the remaining million square feet of space is leased 
item legal proceedings the company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change and are not discounted 
we have been designated as a potentially responsible party in eleven federal and state superfund sites 
in addition to the superfund sites  the company may also have the obligation to remediate seven other previously owned facilities and three other currently owned facilities 
at the superfund sites  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that the company s liability could be joint and several  meaning that the company could be required to pay an amount in excess of its proportionate share of the remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund sites and of other liable parties at the previously owned facilities has been considered  where appropriate  in the determination of the company s estimated liability 
we have established reserves that are believed to be adequate to cover our share of the potential costs of remediation at each of the superfund sites and the previously and currently owned facilities 
while it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters  particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the company may undertake in the future  in the opinion of management  compliance with the present environmental protection laws  before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
from time to time  our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization under united states bankruptcy laws 
in such cases  certain pre petition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 
management believes that the final resolution of these preference items will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in addition  we are a party to certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business that  in the opinion of management  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

executive overview performance and outlook rr donnelley measures its financial performance using both generally accepted accounting principles gaap and non gaap measures 
the company believes that certain non gaap measures  when presented in conjunction with comparable gaap measures  are useful because that information is an appropriate measure for evaluating the company s operating performance 
internally  the company uses this non gaap information as an indicator of business performance and evaluates management s effectiveness with specific reference to this indicator 
these measures should be considered in addition to  not a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
a complete reconciliation of gaap net earnings to non gaap net earnings is presented on pages and of this annual report on form k 
on a gaap basis  the company s results on key measures in versus were as follows net sales increased  to billion  operating margins declined to from in  net earnings per diluted share declined in to  and cash flow from continuing operations increased to million

the strong financial results reflect the successful integration of rr donnelley and moore wallace  significant new customer wins  expansion of existing customer relationships  improved cross selling and substantial cost savings from procurement  operational re engineering and administrative streamlining efforts 
the acquisition of astron in june was an important extension of the company into the higher growth document based business process outsourcing dbpo sector 
astron is the leading provider of end to end dbpo solutions in the united kingdom 
with a full service model  astron delivers inbound and outbound customer communication services  print management  statement processing  and document storage 
combined with the strength of the rr donnelley brand  the company believes that astron is positioned to grow beyond its traditional markets by better competing for large  long term government and commercial outsourcing contracts and by leveraging its low cost customer support centers in india  poland and sri lanka to serve markets worldwide 
the company s two largest segments  publishing and retail services and integrated print communications  both delivered strong gains in net sales and operating margins during the company s increased capital investments in the domestic publishing and retail services platform supported revenue and productivity gains across most businesses 
in addition  europe and asia annualized revenues increased over through a combination of strong growth across key customer relationships and the acquisitions of asia printers group and poligrafia 

table of contents the forms and labels business continues to be challenged by difficult market trends due to continued electronic substitution of forms and a declining pricing environment with overall segment results below expectations 
as a result  in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of million to reflect a reduction in the fair value of this business based on forward net sales and operating margin expectations for the north american forms and labels business consistent with current trends 
rr donnelley  however  continues to be a market leader in this segment  and management is committed to maximizing the value of this business 
in  the company took important steps to strengthen its sales effort and reduce its cost base in forms and labels 
based on these actions  management believes that the forms and labels business will continue to be profitable and a stable source of cash flow for the company 
in  the company expects that the competitive environment  for most of its business lines  will continue to remain intense with excess industry capacity continuing to drive price declines 
to counter this trend  the company expects to continue to identify productivity opportunities and target its investments at higher growth sectors such as dbpo and digital print 
capital spending of million in was higher than historical levels due to the company s strategic decision to update its publishing and retail services manufacturing platform and support new business 
in  the company s capital investment is expected to be lower than in as the company completes its program to update its publishing and retail services manufacturing platform

additionally  in december of  the company completed the sale of its peak technologies business peak  which was not central to the company s core business or strategy 
industry challenges the company faces many challenges and risks operating globally in highly competitive markets 
item a  risk factors  discusses many of these issues  but the company s strategy is primarily focused on meeting the challenges of industry wide price competition and the advancement of technology 
overcapacity and pricing environment the print and related services industry in general continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive 
across the company s business segments  many competitors rely on price as a key competitive lever 
management expects that prices for the company s products and services will therefore continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years 
in this environment  the company believes it needs to continue to lower its cost structure  and extend into higher value service offerings 
while the industry environment has been difficult for a number of years  the company has demonstrated its ability to maintain and enhance margins through productivity and by offering higher value products and services 
technology technological changes  such as the electronic distribution of documents and data  on line distribution and hosting of media content  advances in digital printing  print on demand  and internet technologies continue to 
table of contents impact the market for the company s products and services 
as a substitute for print  the impact of these technologies has been felt most strongly in the forms and labels segment  as electronic communication and transaction technology has eliminated or devalued the role of many traditional paper forms 
these factors contributed to the million non cash impairment charge for the north american forms and labels reporting unit  recorded in the forms and labels segment during the future impact of technology on the company s business is difficult to predict and could result in additional charges in the future 
while new technologies present significant challenges to certain of the company s traditional businesses  management believes that the company is a leader in key technologies that will be valuable sources of industry growth 
these technologies include digital content management and premedia services  digital print for personalization and print on demand  and low cost document process management 
in  the company took key steps to capitalize on these technology advantages through its acquisition of astron and by taking actions to more strongly protect its patented technology advantages in digital print processes 
the company also plans to focus more of its growth investments in digital technologies in future years 
significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for the majority of its products upon shipment to the customer and the transfer of title and risk of loss 
contracts generally specify fob shipping point terms 
under agreements with certain customers  custom products may be stored by the company for future delivery 
in these situations  the company receives a logistics and warehouse management fee for the services it provides 
in certain cases  delivery and billing schedules are outlined in the customer agreement and product revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  and there is a reasonable assurance as to collectibility 
because the majority of products are customized  product returns are not significant  however  the company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale 
billings for third party shipping and handling costs are included in net sales 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
long term product contract revenue is recognized based on the completed contract method or percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is used only for contracts that will take longer than three months to complete  where project stages are clearly defined and can be invoiced and where the contract contains enforceable rights by both parties 
revenue related to short term service contracts and contracts that do not meet the percentage of completion criteria is recognized when the contract is completed 
within the company s global capital markets business  which serves the global financial services end market  the company produces highly customized materials such as regulatory s filings  initial public offerings and edgar related services 
revenue is recognized for these services following final delivery of the printed product or upon completion of the service performed 

table of contents revenues related to the company s premedia operations  which include digital content management  photography  color services and page production  are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract  typically upon completion of the performed service and acceptance by the customer 
with respect to the company s logistics operations  whose operations include the delivery of printed material  the company recognizes revenue upon completion of the delivery of services 
the company records deferred revenue in situations where amounts are invoiced but the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are not met 
such revenue is recognized when all criteria are subsequently met 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is reviewed for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services 
specific customer provisions are made when a review of significant outstanding amounts  utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends  indicates that collection is doubtful 
in addition  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable and the company s historical collection experience 
the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could change  and additional changes to the allowance could be necessary in the future if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than the company s historical experience 
inventories the company records inventories at the lower of cost or market values 
most of the company s inventories are valued under the last in first out lifo basis 
changes in the inflation indices may cause an increase or decrease in the value of inventories accounted for under the lifo costing method 
the company maintains inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined in part by future demand forecasts 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for its products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  the company could be required to increase its inventory allowances 
goodwill and other long lived assets the company s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors including valuations performed by third party appraisers 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
based on its organization structure  the company has identified reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill is allocated 
goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative excess fair value of each reporting unit 
when the company s organization structure changes  new or revised reporting units may be identified  and goodwill is reallocated  if necessary  based on relative excess fair value 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances 
the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the company performs an additional fair value measurement calculation to determine the impairment loss  which is charged to operations 
in  the company recorded a non cash charge of million to reflect impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in the north american forms and labels reporting unit 
as part of its annual impairment analysis for this reporting unit  the company engaged a third party appraisal firm to determine the fair value of the unit  in part based on estimates of future net sales  operating margin and cash flows developed by management 
in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  the company also used the third party appraisal firm to value the significant tangible and intangible long lived assets of the reporting unit 

table of contents the company evaluates the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company performs indefinite lived impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant decrease in the market value of the assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators  the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
all of the company s goodwill and long lived asset impairment assessments are determined based on established fair value techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses require management to estimate both future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the current business model 
the assumptions supporting valuation models  including discount rates  are determined using the best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
certain investments in affordable housing  which are included in other noncurrent assets  are recorded at cost  as adjusted for the company s share of any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying management s judgment using a significant number of estimates 
management derives its estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits and tax deductions to be realized and expected residual values upon sale or disposition of the company s ownership interests 
expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships and include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs  debt levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates 
should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future  the company might be required to further write down its carrying value of these investments 
commitments and contingencies the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to environmental  employment and other matters  as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection 
periodically  the company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and might revise its estimates 
the company purchases third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims that exceed a certain level 
the company is responsible for the payment of claims below these insured limits  and consulting actuaries are utilized to estimate the obligation associated with incurred losses  which is recorded in accrued liabilities 
historical loss development factors are utilized to project the future development of incurred losses  and these amounts are adjusted based upon actual claims experience and settlement 
if actual experience of claims development is significantly different from these estimates  an adjustment in future periods may be required 
restructuring the company records restructuring charges when liabilities are incurred as part of a plan approved by management  with the appropriate level of authority  for the elimination of duplicative functions  the closure of facilities  or the exit of a line of business  generally in order to reduce the company s overall cost structure 
certain 
table of contents restructuring costs are recognized as a cost of acquisitions because the plans were contemplated at the time of the acquisition and were  therefore  included in the purchase price allocation 
these restructuring charges and related liabilities are based on contractual obligations or management s best estimates at the time the charges are recorded 
the restructuring liabilities might change in future periods based on several factors that could differ from original estimates and assumptions 
these include  but are not limited to contract settlements on terms different than originally expected  ability to sublease properties based on market conditions at rates or on timelines different than originally estimated  or changes to original plans as a result of mergers or acquisitions 
such changes might result in reversals of or additions to restructuring charges that could affect amounts reported in the consolidated statements of operations of future periods 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  the company s tax returns are subject to audit by various us and foreign tax authorities 
the company accrues for uncertain tax positions for which it believes a loss is probable and estimable 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
the company has recorded deferred tax assets related to domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards 
limitations on the utilization of these tax assets generally apply  accordingly  management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets when management has concluded that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
if actual results differ from these estimates  or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded 
pension and postretirement benefit plans the company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience  market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors 
the pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of september for all years presented 
the company determines its assumption for the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual service and interest costs based on an index of high quality corporate bond yields and matched funding yield curve analysis as of that date 
the company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of pension and postretirement plan assets 
the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming the growth in plan liabilities over the long run 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in us large capitalization stocks  us small capitalization stocks and international securities 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
the expected long term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations  historical asset returns  current and expected future market conditions  risk and active management 
table of contents premiums 
the prospective target asset allocation percentage for both the pension and postretirement benefit plans is approximately for equity securities and approximately for fixed income and other securities 
the expected return on plan assets assumption at september  ranged from to for the company s major u 
s and canadian pension plans and was for the company s funded us postretirement medical benefit plan 
the discount rates used at september  to measure pension and postretirement benefit obligations of the major us and canadian plans ranged from to 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rates at september  would increase the pension plans accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
the company also maintains several pension plans in international locations 
the assets  liabilities and expense associated with these plans are not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the expected returns on plan assets and discount rates for these plans are determined based on each plan s investment approach  local interest rates  and plan participant profiles 
the health care cost trend rates used in valuing the company s postretirement benefit obligations are established based upon actual health care cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers 
at september   the current weighted average health care trend rate assumption was for pre age participants and for post age participants 
the current trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate trend rate of 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in millions postretirement benefit obligation total postretirement benefit service and interest cost components a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in millions postretirement benefit obligation total postretirement benefit service and interest cost components net off balance sheet arrangements other than non cancelable operating lease commitments  the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
financial review in the financial review that follows  the company discusses its consolidated results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and certain other information 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that begin on page f non gaap measures the company believes that certain non gaap measures  when presented in conjunction with comparable gaap measures  are useful because they are appropriate measures for evaluating the company s operating performance 
internally  the company uses non gaap information as an indicator of business performance  and evaluates management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators 
these measures should be considered in addition to  not a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap
