table of contents for the years ended june  in thousands  except share and per share amounts balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital total assets total stockholders equity figures may not add due to rounding item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of continuing operations overview our fiscal performance improved from last year by nearly every metric we track sales bookings for the fiscal year were up  to nearly million 
total revenue increased compared with the prior fiscal year 
us revenue grew 
total internet based revenue grew compared with fiscal  driven by increases in us and european internet based revenue of and  respectively 
operating income increased  while operating margin improved from for fiscal to in fiscal maximizing the productivity of our professional staff and improving the efficiency of our sales and marketing efforts has helped us to achieve the revenue growth and operating margin improvement noted above 
our us revenue growth in fiscal was propelled by revenue gains of or more in our healthcare  technology telecom  automotive  marketing communications and product solutions research practices 
this growth was tempered by the performance of a number of research practices where revenue declined on a year over year basis  specifically government and policy  hisb and consumer packaged goods 
additionally  revenue from internet based market research increased as our clients continued to recognize and desire the inherent advantages that online research provides 
revenue in europe declined during fiscal compared with fiscal  due to a number of factors  including unfavorable foreign exchange rate differences  post wirthlin acquisition integration challenges and diminished sales efforts due to a difficulty in hiring sales personnel 
despite this performance  we plan to continue to invest time and money to improve our european operations since we believe that the growth opportunities  especially for internet research  are highly attractive 
according to the july edition of inside research  european spending on internet based research is expected to increase in calendar year commensurately  our european internet based revenue as a percentage of total european revenue grew from for fiscal to for fiscal our efforts to improve operating margins are yielding results  and we are committed to continuing them into fiscal and beyond 
we believe that we can potentially achieve an additional four to five percentage points of operating margin improvement and reach a double digit operating margin run rate as we exit fiscal we believe the following strategies will enable us to achieve that goal improve european operating margins since europe accounts for approximately of our total revenue  every five points of operating margin improvement in europe translates 
table of contents into approximately one point of total operating margin improvement 
even though we have been focused on controlling costs  streamlining processes and improving productivity throughout our european business  our performance in europe remains erratic 
improve sales productivity more than of our client facing employees have now completed sales training which emphasizes strategic selling and provides effective tools to help target and win the most profitable projects and build lasting client relationships 
these strategies are now taking hold and helped us achieve record breaking sales bookings of over million in fiscal q  which helped push revenue to over million for the three months ended june  and million for the full fiscal year 
improve utilization rates as explained below in significant factors affecting company performance  utilization rate improvement can significantly impact our operating margins  since every three points of utilization improvement generally translates into approximately one point of operating margin improvement  assuming stable realization and pricing 
specifically  utilization has improved from for the three months ended september  to for the three months ended june   and has remained stable at for the last three fiscal quarters 
our long term target is to achieve and sustain a company wide utilization rate 
increase prices to match value for the first time in five years  we implemented a rate card price increase for both data collection and professional services in august the blended price for a full service research project rose by an average of 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative reaction from our clients due to the increase 
improve process efficiency over the last seven years  most of our research processes have had to grow rapidly in both power and scale in order to meet our clients requirements for increased effectiveness in decreased time 
as a result  our research systems have become overly complex and a bit cumbersome 
we are now engaged in a major improvement process designed to improve the velocity and efficiency of our global research process  which should result in faster throughput at lower costs 
also  during fiscal we established a single global research operations infrastructure to gain economies of scale  properly share resources and standardize our research process 
as a result  we believe that we are currently the only global research firm with one integrated and unified data collection platform 
business combinations on september   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of wirthlin worldwide  inc wirthlin  a privately held opinion research and strategic consulting firm headquartered in reston  virginia  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger among us  wirthlin  capitol merger sub  llc and the stockholders of wirthlin 
wirthlin was engaged in businesses in the market research and polling industry that were complementary to ours 
this acquisition has created opportunities for revenue growth  cost savings and other synergies including the ability to cross sell to one another s clients  offer more comprehensive and diverse services  and use a combined worldwide network 
it has also provided the opportunity to convert wirthlin traditional based clients to the internet and has expanded our research expertise in certain areas including brand and strategic consulting  government and policy  financial services and consumer packaged goods 
on march   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of novatris  a privately owned share corporation organized and existing under the laws of france  for a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock 
novatris was engaged in market research and polling activities that were complimentary to ours 
the 
table of contents acquisition added approximately one million panel members to our existing european panel and created opportunities for revenue growth  cost savings and other synergies 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and were included in our financial statements commencing on september  and march   respectively 
further financial information about business combinations is included in note  business combinations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
restructuring fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to certain actions designed to align the cost structure of our uk operations with the operational needs of that business 
management developed a formal plan that included closing two facilities in macclesfield and stockport and consolidating those operations into our hazel grove location 
this consolidation was completed by june  at a cost of less than million  the majority of which represents future cash payments on the remaining lease commitment for the macclesfield facility 
additionally  we classified the stockport facility and the related property  plant and equipment as assets held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are currently in the process of identifying potential buyers for the stockport facility and expect to sell the facility as soon as practicable but no later than june  we believe that the current carrying value of that facility and the related assets do not exceed their fair value less anticipated selling costs  based upon an independent third party appraisal 
the consolidation of these operations resulted in the disposal of certain fixed assets at a cost of less than million 
anticipated selling costs are expected to be less than million  all of which will involve cash payments 
in connection with the facilities consolidation discussed above  we also reduced the staff of the affected operations by full time equivalents and incurred million in severance charges  all of which will involve cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring charges for the fiscal plan during the fiscal year ended june  amounts in s lease severance commitments total net charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal cash payments during fiscal remaining reserve at june  all actions in the plan were completed by june  cash payments in connection with the plan will be completed no later than june  as a result of the actions described above  we anticipate cash savings of approximately million in fiscal fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to cost reduction initiatives implemented by our management  and in the following quarter completed our accounting for the initiatives by making additional adjustments 
management developed a formal plan that included a reduction in the staffs of both our us and us operations 
as a result of the plan  we also recorded a reserve for a lease commitment related to office space in london  which we leased prior to our acquisition of wirthlin  that we determined was no longer needed as a result of the aforementioned reduction in staff  as well as the 
table of contents integration of the uk operations of wirthlin 
the plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the third quarter of fiscal the total number of affected employees from our us and us operations was we realized non cash savings of approximately million and cash savings of approximately million in fiscal from these cost reduction initiatives 
the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring charges for the fiscal plan during the fiscal years ended june  and amounts in s lease severance commitments total net charge during fiscal cash payments during fiscal fiscal adjustments remaining reserve at june  cash payments during fiscal remaining reserve at june  all actions in the plan were completed as of june  cash payments for severance were completed in april and cash payments on the lease commitment  which were to continue through january  were completed in december as a result of an early buyout agreement reached with the landlord 
further financial information about our fiscal and restructuring plans is included in note  restructuring charges  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell our japanese subsidiaries collectively  hi japan 
at that time  we recorded an anticipated loss on disposal of approximately million 
approximately million of the recorded loss represented the impairment charge for the full amount of the goodwill attributable to hi japan  and approximately million represented a reserve for the anticipated costs of selling the business 
we based our impairment determination on the fact that hi japan did not contribute to our profitability at the level that was anticipated at the time of acquisition 
as a result of recording the goodwill write down and reserve for anticipated costs to sell the business  the book values of the remaining net assets of hi japan approximated their estimated fair value at that time 
on may   we sold hi japan to mr 
minoru aoo  hi japan s former president  for an aggregate purchase price consisting of a cash payment of million and mr 
aoo s surrender to us of  shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of million  based on the average closing price of our common stock for the three day period ending may  we subsequently retired all of these shares 
the final loss on disposal as a result of the sale was million and resulted in a capital loss for tax purposes of million 
we did not realize an income tax benefit as a result of the loss on disposal  as the loss is a capital loss  and we had no significant capital gains against which the capital loss could have been offset 
as such  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset  as more fully described in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
we classified hi japan as a discontinued operation for the fiscal year ended june   consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
as such  the results of operations  net of taxes  and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of hi japan have been reflected in the 
table of contents accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in this form k as discontinued operations  assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations  respectively 
all prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
these reclassifications of the prior period financial statements did not impact total assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  net income or cash flows 
further financial information regarding discontinued operations is included in note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes and tax contingencies  hipoints loyalty program  restructuring charges  stock based compensation  post employment obligations  and discontinued operations 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue from services is recognized on a proportional performance basis using the cost to cost methodology  which we believe is effectively equivalent to output measures 
this revenue includes amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct out of pocket expenses 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon it becomes probable that such losses will occur 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of clients to make required payments 
we continually assess the collectibility of outstanding client invoices 
in estimating the allowance  we consider factors such as historical collections  historical write offs  a client s current credit worthiness  age of the receivable balance both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay 
actual collections could differ from our estimates  requiring additional adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to sfas no 
accordingly  the preliminary purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and 
table of contents liabilities and intangible assets acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are valued separately based on estimates of future cash flows and are amortized over their expected useful life 
amortizable intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test under sfas no 
if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure impairment  if any  based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and ceased amortizing goodwill as of that date 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets when impaired 
these events or circumstances generally would include the occurrence of operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the asset 
as we have one reportable segment  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
we performed the initial step by comparing our fair market value as determined by our publicly traded stock to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
based upon its annual evaluations  we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount at june   and  resulting in no impairment 
if impairment had occurred  any excess of carrying value over fair value would have been recorded as a loss 
prior to performing our annual impairment analysis for the year ended june   we recorded a million impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal for the full amount of the goodwill attributable to hi japan  the operations of which have been classified as discontinued operations see discontinued operations above 
income taxes and tax contingencies we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases for operating profit and tax liability carryforward 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that result from temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at june  sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of the available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the 
table of contents deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists 
actual outcomes that differ from our estimate of potential exposure could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
hipoints loyalty program in july  we initiated hipoints  a loyalty program designed to reward respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which occurs after one year of account inactivity 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from the expected redemption rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges represent costs incurred to better align our cost structure with the needs of our business 
restructuring charges can include termination benefits for reductions in staff  as well as costs for the consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities  if any 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions 
if actual conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record additional restructuring charges or reverse previously recorded charges accordingly 
for further discussion regarding the impact of restructuring charges on the results of our operations  see restructuring above 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the share based payment on the date of grant 
we elected to use the modified prospective approach for adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at july  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption resulted in the recognition of million of compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employee directors 
as of june   we had million of total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under our long term incentive plans 
that expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
table of contents over the requisite service period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which employs the following assumptions expected volatility based on historical volatilities from daily share price observations for our stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the options granted 
expected life of the option based on the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years  calculated using the simplified method as allowed by staff accounting bulletin no 
risk free rate based on the implied yield available at the time the options were granted on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option when granted 
dividend yield based on our historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to our shareholders 
expected volatility and the expected life of the options granted  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes option pricing model  involve management s best estimates at that time 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are set forth in note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report on form k 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards is based on the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
we grant options to purchase our stock at fair value as of the date of grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or restricted shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior and the vesting period of the respective stock options or restricted shares 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
post employment obligations we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives which obligate us to make payments for varying periods of time and under terms and circumstances set forth in the agreements 
in part  the payments are in consideration for obligations of the executives not to compete with us after termination of their employment and  in part  the payments relate to other relationships between the parties 
we account for our obligations under these agreements in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and to the extent that we become obligated in the future to make payments to one or more of our executives under their employment agreements  such obligations could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
the impact on our results of operations of post employment obligations that arose during the fiscal years ended june   and is discussed below within results of operations 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are defined in sfas no 
as a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
sfas no 
further provides that the assets and liabilities of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations be presented separately in the entity s balance sheet

panelist incentives our panelists receive both cash and non cash incentives through programs such as our hipoints loyalty program for participating in our surveys 
we award cash incentives to our panelists for participating in surveys  which are earned when we receive a timely survey response 
non cash incentives in the form of points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which occurs after one year of account inactivity

furthermore  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of our valuation allowance and adjust it based on whether or not our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized

references to the impact of wirthlin in the discussion of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june  and are based upon our assumption that the impact of wirthlin on our continuing operations has continued in a manner similar to the effect tracked by us in the quarter following the acquisition 
in addition  the results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june  and  as presented and discussed herein  do not include the results of our discontinued japanese operations 

table of contents year ended june  versus year ended june  revenue from services 
total revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in total revenue was due in part to our september acquisition of wirthlin along with additional factors more fully described below 
us revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in us revenue was principally driven by revenue growth in the following verticals healthcare  as a result of our focus on improving the productivity of selling efforts in these markets through deep account penetration  as well as from the continued maturation of existing client relationships  technology and telecom  as a result of a strategic increase in our focus in these markets throughout the current fiscal year  automotive  as a result of expanding our revenue base with several key clients in this market through deep account penetration  and product solutions  as a result of greater collaboration between this group and our researchers that work with clients across the various industries that we serve 
also  we believe that us revenue has increased as a result of our continued focus on building long term relationships with our clients in order to obtain projects that are recurring in nature 
offsetting the growth in us revenue as noted above were declines in revenue in the following verticals government  as a result of reconstituting the internal organizational structure of the group and redefinition of its approach within this market during fiscal  hisb  as a result of continued pricing pressures  and consumer packaged goods  as a result of turnover within its project and dedicated sales resource staffs 
european revenue decreased by million to million for fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal the decline in european revenue  partially offset by the growth in european internet based revenue discussed below  was principally impacted by the following unfavorable impact of million as a result of foreign exchange rate differences and the appreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro  challenges of post wirthlin acquisition integration  and difficulty recruiting sales personnel

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal increases to gross profit were more than offset by the impact of an approximately two point increase in the direct purchases component of cost of services as a percentage of total revenue as a result of the mix of projects for fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit is directly affected by overall revenue as well as changes in the pricing and mix of work performed and the cost components on each project eg project personnel time  data processing and data collection from one period to another 
additionally  gross profit reflects our treatment of all project personnel time which is not allocated to specific revenue generating projects as either sales and marketing or general and administrative expense based upon the unbillable tasks on which the time is spent 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense was essentially flat at million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was principally due to our strategic focus on improving the productivity of our selling efforts as discussed earlier  offset in part by a slight increase in the unbillable project personnel time in support of sales and marketing efforts from approximately million for fiscal to million for fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the dollar increase and decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue were principally impacted by the following million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal as a result of our adoption of sfas no

table of contents interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in net interest and other income was principally impacted by the following an increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from million at june  to million at june   and improved rates of return compared with those of fiscal income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on continuing operations for fiscal  compared with a provision for income taxes of million on continuing operations for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal includes million in tax benefits realized as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against tax losses for which it became more likely than not that a portion of the underlying benefit will be realized in the future 
income tax expense was principally a non cash item for fiscal and fiscal year ended june  versus year ended june  revenue from services 
total revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase was driven by the additional revenue that resulted from our september acquisition of wirthlin  increases in revenue from our existing us and european operations and to a lesser extent  the additional revenue that resulted from our march acquisition of novatris

depreciation and amortization increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal while depreciation and amortization expense remained fairly consistent as a percentage of total revenue  the dollar increase is principally due to the depreciation and amortization associated with the fixed and intangible assets that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of wirthlin in september restructuring charges 
see above under restructuring for further discussion regarding our fiscal restructuring plan 
no restructuring charges were recorded during fiscal interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million or of total revenue for fiscal  a slight increase over net interest and other income of million or of revenue for fiscal income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million on continuing operations for fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of million on continuing operations for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  which differed from an anticipated effective tax rate of principally due to the effects of a change in estimate during fiscal associated with state tax apportionment factors  partially attributable to our acquisition of wirthlin in september income tax expense was principally a non cash item for fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents significant factors affecting company performance our revenue mix and gross profitability we treat all of the revenue from a project as internet based whenever more than of the data collection for that project was completed online 
regardless of data collection mode  most full service market research projects contain three specific phases as outlined in the chart below 
generally  the costs of a project are spread evenly across those three phases 
data colection internet based data collection has certain fixed costs relating to data collection  panel incentives and database development and maintenance 
when the volume of internet based work reaches the point where fixed costs are absorbed  increases in internet based revenue tend to increase profitability  assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses are properly controlled 
projects designated as internet based may have traditional data collection components  particularly in multi country studies where internet databases are not fully developed 
that traditional data collection component tends to decrease the profitability of the project 
profitability is also decreased by direct costs of outsourcing programming and telephone data collection and incentive pass through costs 
for further information regarding internet based revenue  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and  please see the table in our ability to measure our performance below 
our ability to measure our performance during the first half of fiscal  we began publicly reporting certain key operating metrics  specifically sales bookings  ending sales backlog  billable full time equivalents  days of sales outstanding and utilization 
each of these key operating metrics enables us to measure the current and forecasted performance of our business relative to historical trends and promote a management culture that focuses on accountability 
we believe that this ultimately leads to increased productivity and more effective and efficient use of our human and capital resources 

table of contents key operating metrics  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and are as follows us dollar amounts in millions q q q q q q q q fy fy fy fy fy fy fy fy internet revenue of total revenue us internet revenue of us revenue european internet revenue of european revenue cash marketable securities sales bookings ending sales backlog billable full time equivalents ftes days sales outstanding dso days days days days days days days days utilization q and q fy exclude wirthlin q fy excludes wirthlinworldwide  q includes the addition of million of wirthlin sales backlog for the periods prior to which are not reflected in the reported q and q fy sales bookings 
additional information regarding each of the key operating metrics noted above is as follows sales bookings are defined as the contract value of revenue generating projects that are anticipated to take place during the next four fiscal quarters for which a firm client commitment was received during the current period  less any adjustments during the current period to prior period sales bookings due to contract value adjustments or project cancellations 
sales bookings for the three months ended june  were consistent with sales bookings for the same prior year period 
however  we believe that the increased levels of sales bookings achieved in fiscal compared to fiscal are a strong indicator that our sales productivity improvement initiatives through deep account penetration are paying dividends for us 
tracking sales bookings enhances our ability to forecast long term revenue and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
however  we are also mindful that sales bookings often vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
information concerning our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new sales bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
ending sales backlog is defined as prior period ending sales backlog plus current period sales bookings  less revenue recognized on outstanding projects as of the end of the period 
ending sales backlog helps us to manage our future staffing levels more accurately and is also an indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
generally  projects included in ending sales backlog at the end of a fiscal period will convert to revenue from services during the following twelve months 

table of contents ending sales backlog of million for the three months ended june  represented a increase compared with the ending sales backlog for the same prior year period 
we believe that this increase and the overall growth in our ending sales backlog quarter by quarter when compared with the prior year are also strong indicators of the success of our strategic initiative to improve our sales productivity through deep account penetration 
billable full time equivalents fte s are defined as the hours of available billable capacity in a given period divided by total standard hours for a full time employee and represent a monthly average for the periods reported 
measuring fte s enables us to determine proper staffing levels  minimize unbillable time and improve utilization and profitability 
billable fte s of for the three months ended june  were essentially flat with the billable fte s reported for the same prior year period 
days of sales outstanding dso is calculated as accounts receivable as of the end of the applicable period including unbilled receivables less deferred revenue divided by our daily revenue total revenue for the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period 
measuring dso allows us to minimize our investment in working capital  measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts and helps forecast cash flow 
generally  a lower dso measure equates to more efficient use of working capital 
dso for the three months ended june  represented a improvement compared with dso for the three months ended june  this improvement  as well as the improved dso for the fiscal year ended june  when compared with the prior year  was the result of our continued focus on ensuring the effectiveness of our collection efforts and was also a key driver of the increase in our cash and marketable securities at june  when compared with june  utilization is defined as hours billed by project personnel in connection with specific revenue generating projects divided by total hours of available capacity 
hours billed do not include marketing  selling or proposal generation time 
tracking utilization enables efficient management of overall staffing levels and promotes greater accountability for the management of resources on individual projects 
generally  we believe that every three point improvement in utilization results in a one point improvement in our operating margin  assuming stable realization rates and pricing 
utilization for the three months ended june  was compared with for the same prior year period 
this improvement and the improved utilization since the first quarter of fiscal are the result of our continued focus on minimizing unbillable professional staff time 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents the following table sets forth net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in provided by financing activities  for the fiscal years ended june net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to the following increase in income from continuing operations  net of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and restructuring charges net of cash payments  and an improvement in the timeliness of collecting amounts due on outstanding invoices  as noted by a million increase in cash collected on accounts receivable and a million increase in cash collected on amounts billed in excess of costs deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to the following decrease in income from continuing operations  net of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges net of cash payments  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively  both of which were principally the result of our september acquisition of wirthlin 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally attributable to the following million decrease in net cash paid in connection with acquisitions 
there were no acquisitions in the current year  compared with million in net cash paid for our september acquisition of wirthlin  million increase in cash used for the purchase of marketable securities from million for fiscal to million for fiscal million decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  million decrease in cash used for capital expenditures from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  principally impacted by million in leasehold improvements to our new york city office during the prior year  and million used for the acquisition of intangible assets during fiscal  down from million for fiscal net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was principally attributable to the following million increase in cash paid in connection with acquisitions from million for our march acquisition of novatris to million for our september acquisition of wirthlin  million decrease in cash used for the purchase of marketable securities from million for fiscal to million for fiscal million increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  million of which were used to fund our acquisition of wirthlin  
table of contents million increase in cash used for capital expenditures from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  principally impacted by million in leasehold improvements to our new york city office  and million used for the acquisition of certain trademarks during fiscal  with no similar activity in fiscal net cash used in provided by financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to the following million decrease in cash used to repay outstanding notes  as all such notes were paid in full during fiscal  million decrease in cash provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and million in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock under the repurchase program  which commenced in may net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to the following million decrease in cash provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and repayment of million in outstanding notes acquired in connection with the september acquisition of wirthlin  whereas no such note repayments occurred during fiscal working capital at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of from million at june  in addition  we also had million in marketable securities at june   an increase of from million at june  based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the cash requirements that we anticipate are necessary to support our planned operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
if we acquire additional businesses  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  the marketing and selling of our services  our promotional activities and our acquisition activities 
for the fiscal year ending june   our capital expenditures are expected to range between and million 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and the cash and marketable securities we currently hold at june  are sufficient to provide adequate funding for any foreseeable capital requirements that may arise 
in order to continue to generate revenue  we must constantly develop new business  both for growth and to replace non renewed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of our revenue  we have had to find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as client relationships and work for continuing clients change and will likely have to 
table of contents continue to do so in the future 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of our business plan  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted 
share repurchase program on may   the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program the repurchase program in an effort to improve shareholder return on investment 
under the repurchase program  up to million may be used by us  in the discretion of our board of directors from time to time  to acquire our common stock during the twelve months following the date the program was authorized 
purchases may be made in the open market or in any private transaction  and in accordance with applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
the repurchase program and related activity are more fully described above in item issuer purchases of equity securities 
during the year ended june   we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million 
all shares repurchased were subsequently retired 
at june   the repurchase program had million in available capacity 
we anticipate using the remaining program capacity during the fiscal year ending june   subject to the conditions described above 
line and letters of credit at june   we had  and continue to maintain  a line of credit with a commercial bank that provides borrowing availability up to million  at the prime interest rate at june  
borrowings under this arrangement are due upon demand 
there were no borrowings under this agreement at june   but there were letters of credit outstanding of approximately million  which correspondingly reduce our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit 
among them is a letter of credit for million approximately million based on the june  euro to us dollar conversion rate  which serves as the collateral for the contingent purchase price related to our acquisition of novatris during the quarter ended march  on august   we entered into a credit agreement the agreement with a commercial bank the bank for a line of credit which will enable us to borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time outstanding credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are repayable as set forth in a line of credit note the note executed concurrently with the agreement 
accrued interest is payable monthly  or in the case of libor rate loans  at the end of libor rate periods but at least every three months  and all accrued interest and outstanding principal is payable in full on may  additionally  the bank agrees to issue letters of credit under the line of credit at our request in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
availability under the line of credit is reduced by the face amount of outstanding letters of credit 
upon termination of the line of credit  we must cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility expires on may  the note bears interest at the prime rate  libor plus basis points or the federal funds rate plus basis points  based upon instructions provided by us as to whether advances are prime rate  libor or federal funds rate advances 
the credit facility contains affirmative covenants that require us to maintain insurance  maintain our existence  provide financial information to the bank  and provide the bank with notice of material claims against us and defaults under the credit facility 
it also contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to change the nature of our 
table of contents business  cease operations  merge  acquire or consolidate with any other entity unless we are the surviving entity in such a merger  acquisition or consolidation  change our name  or sell a material part of our assets outside of the ordinary course of business  which sale would have a material adverse effect on us 
we also agree not to grant security interests in our accounts  our payment intangibles and our general intangibles relating to the payment of money 
we are arranging to substitute letters of credit under the credit facility for letters of credit currently outstanding issued by the commercial bank with which we have a million line of credit  for our account 
upon completion of such substitutions  our existing facilities with that commercial bank will be terminated 
at june  and  we had no short term or long term borrowings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions 
we have international sales and continuing operations in the united kingdom  france  hong kong and china 
therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us sales are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
consolidated income and expense items are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of 
table of contents foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in our results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of our continuing international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries was not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating the results of our foreign subsidiaries with our us results  due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our us operations 
while the us now contributes significantly to our revenues  we continue to believe that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk is low  given that our uk operations have historically produced low operating profits 
however  if the operating profits in the uk increase and we continue to expand in europe  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
thus  we evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that we incur expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volumes paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
since our foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency  given the amount and short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis as of june  holding all other variables constant  we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
therefore  we have not entered into any arrangements that involve derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
as we continue to expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks
