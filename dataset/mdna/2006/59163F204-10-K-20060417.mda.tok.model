item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations for the periods discussed below should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as changes in the telecommunications market  the addition or expiration of customer contracts  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  lengthy sales cycles  the timing and expense of the expansion or contraction of our call center network  and other factors including those discussed under item a  risk factors 
overview we are a provider of enhanced directory assistance and other information services through operators and electronically 
we contract primarily with wireless carriers  voice over internet protocol voip providers  cable companies  competitive local exchange carriers clec and prepaid carriers to provide our services to their subscribers 
our proprietary enhanced directory assistance platform provides comprehensive directory assistance listings and other informational content and services 
other non directory assistance services and content include access to personal contacts and calendars  reservation services  movie listings and a variety of other unique services 
our special return to operator features  starback and autoback  make the telephone easier to use and are offered exclusively by metro one 
all of our services are currently provided by operators located only in the united states or electronically 
many of our features or aspects thereof are the subject of patents or pending patent applications 
revenues are derived principally through fees charged to telecommunications carriers and other customers 
in addition to voice based services  we also provide enhanced directory assistance services in electronic format 
these services are provided to customers who electronically issue directory assistance queries and use the returned information to complete and correct their own data records 
we currently provide electronic directory assistance services in a number of delivery formats to meet customer needs including automated file processing and real time individual look ups 
we contract with a broad range of companies that require electronic directory assistance including companies in the service  marketing  and financial sectors 
under our wholesale contracts  carriers agree to route some or all of their directory assistance calls to us 
we offer our services to multiple carriers within the same market 
when a carrier s subscribers dial a typical directory assistance number  such as  or  the calls are routed to and answered by our operators identifying the service by that carrier s brand name 
each carrier customer establishes its own directory assistance fee structure for its subscribers 
wireless subscribers typically pay fees ranging from to plus airtime charges for our services 
we bear no subscriber collection risk with respect to carrier subscribers  however  there may be collection risk to the extent growth and profitability in the telecommunications industry decreases and to the extent we provide services to other types of customers 
we charge our carrier customers on a per call basis 
prices for services provided to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or customers who receive our services in electronic form  may vary based on the nature of the service  volume and other circumstances 
competition in the telecommunications industry  and in the directory assistance market in which we participate  has been intense 
with slowing subscriber growth and declining revenue per user  carriers are looking to lower their costs of providing directory assistance and other services through  among other ways  outsourcing to low cost domestic or overseas operators and utilizing automation to reduce costs 
in response to these and other issues  in may  we launched infone  a service that provided enhanced directory and personal assistant services directly to consumers 
the initial launch of infone was accompanied by a significant nationwide marketing and promotion campaign designed to build brand awareness and encourage customers to sign up for infone 
we spent approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively  on such marketing and promotion campaigns 
revenues from our infone service were not significant in relation to total revenues in   or because of our inability to attract a significant number of subscribers to this service  it was discontinued in december significant events in february  we entered into a master services agreement for directory assistance services the services agreement with nextel operations  inc  acting on behalf of certain affiliates collectively nextel of nextel communications  inc the services agreement superseded our previous services agreement dated in june under the services agreement  we agreed to provide directory assistance services to nextel s customers on a non exclusive basis and nextel could transition call volume away from us on short notice and or terminate services entirely 
in october  we received notification from nextel that it would be terminating the services agreement discussed above effective january  in february  we entered into a settlement agreement and disentanglement transition plan the plan with nextel that resolved certain disputed matters in connection with the termination of the services agreement 
the plan called for metro one to continue to provide services to nextel callers  as needed  through march   for the resolution of any disputes with respect to the termination by nextel  and for the payment by nextel to metro one of up to million in three installments through the end of march 
those payments are in addition to million previously paid by nextel in december in connection with the transition and in addition to the contractual payments by nextel for normal service provided by metro one to nextel callers through the transition period 
calls from nextel were substantially transitioned away from us by march  and  except for contractual payments not yet due for normal service  we have received substantially all amounts due from nextel as of the date of this filing 
including the million payment in december as part of the settlement payments noted above  nextel represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our contract with at t wireless expired in december  and our negotiations did not result in a new contract 
the call volume from at t wireless transitioned away during the second and third quarters of at t wireless accounted for approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively 
our contract with sprint pcs expired in december we agreed to an arrangement with sprint pcs  pursuant to which we continued to handle its subscribers calls through a transition period that began in march and was substantially completed by june  sprint pcs accounted for approximately of our revenues in as a result of the termination of our contracts with nextel and other customers noted above  we have consolidated and reduced our operations significantly and will continue to close call centers and reduce the number of employees both in call centers and in corporate and administrative staff now that the transition of calls from nextel has been completed 
primarily during the second and third quarters of  as part of our ongoing efforts to cut costs and align expenses with reduced revenues  we closed and consolidated the operations of of our call centers 
during  we incurred approximately million of restructuring costs related to these activities 
that amount consisted of approximately million of severance and other employee related termination benefits  approximately million of lease termination costs and approximately million of other costs of restructuring 
these other costs included approximately million of non cash intangible and other asset write offs related to our discontinued infone service  approximately  paid for strategic advisory services  approximately  of costs associated with closing and consolidating the operations of call centers  and approximately  of other costs 
at december   we had approximately  of accrued restructuring costs  primarily related to remaining lease costs of closed facilities 
subsequent to december   we have undertaken additional restructuring activities  due primarily to the departure of call volume from nextel  that have resulted in the closure of an additional call centers in the first quarter of with call volumes transferred into the remaining six call centers 
these closures have resulted in the reduction of approximately  call center employees and the payment of approximately million of related severance benefits 
we expect to incur approximately  of dismantling costs related to these closed call centers primarily in the second quarter of we have significant costs associated with ongoing lease obligations of the closed call centers 
we expect to pay out the lease terms  sublease the properties  buy out or otherwise dispose of these leases during  however  the costs associated with those actions cannot be accurately estimated at this time 
additionally  we have plans to reduce headcount at our corporate headquarters in the second and third quarters of we expect to incur approximately  of severance costs related to these reductions 
in addition  we may undertake additional restructuring and or consolidation efforts in the future that would cause us to incur additional restructuring charges 
termination of the contracts noted above have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and raises doubt as to whether we can continue to operate as a going concern 
we have experienced net losses in each of the quarterly and annual periods since the first quarter of we expect to meet our cash requirements in using our existing cash and cash equivalents 
our management has developed plans to significantly reduce the direct cost of delivering our services  reduce our general and administrative overhead  aggressively pursue new and additional sources of revenues to support our reduced cost structure  and develop and grow our data services business 
there can be no assurance that management s plans will be successful 
in such event  we may attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity  although we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to execute our operations according to our plan or obtain additional financing  we may be forced to cease operations 
our common stock listing was transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq capital market formerly the nasdaq smallcap market on february  we elected to seek a transfer to the nasdaq capital market because we had been unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
by transferring to the nasdaq capital market  we were afforded an extended grace period and now have until july  in which to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement 
if we are unable to regain compliance by july   our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
on october   we received a nasdaq staff deficiency letter informing us that we no longer comply with nasdaq s independent director and audit committee requirements for continued listing 
the letter stated that we had until the earlier of our next annual shareholders meeting or october   in order to regain compliance 
the letter also stated that  in the event we do not regain compliance during this cure period  our common stock will be delisted 
our management and board of directors are considering alternatives to regain compliance with nasdaq s requirements but there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be implemented prior to the end of the applicable cure period 
in a decision  the california public utilities commission puc implemented competitive wholesale pricing for directory assistance data for third party vendors purchasing the data from sbc communications sbc 
the decision determined that sbc continues to enjoy a dominant position as the former monopoly provider of local exchange service in its territory in california and could not use its market power to extract excessive directory assistance data prices that would discriminate against competitors 
the decision required that sbc refund the improper charges with interest 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we received a refund from sbc in the amount of approximately million that is included in other income  net in our december  financial statements 
results of operations the following table shows selected items of our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues direct operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses impairment loss restructuring charges loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss compared to revenues 
revenues decreased to million from million 
call volume decreased to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these decreases resulted primarily from lower call volumes due to the expiration of our contract with at t wireless in mid as well as a lower average revenue per call related to decreased pricing in our new contract with nextel in our overall average revenue per call was approximately in compared to approximately in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses  consisting of the costs of salaries  wages  benefits and taxes of call center personnel  listings data and content acquisition costs  decreased to million from million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and data cost associated with servicing lower call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses increased to from  due primarily to a lower average revenue per call 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million resulting primarily from decreased advertising expense related to infone of approximately million and cost cutting efforts  including the closing of call centers 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at in compared to in restructuring charges 
restructuring charges in consisted primarily of one time termination benefits paid to employees of million  lease termination costs of million and million of other costs 
other costs consisted primarily of costs to dismantle closed call centers  costs to implement our ongoing cost reduction plans  and non cash write downs of certain intangible and other assets related to our discontinued infone service 
these restructuring charges related primarily to the call centers we closed in restructuring charges of approximately  primarily related to continuing lease obligations on closed facilities  have been accrued but not paid at december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to the write down of fixed assets in the fourth quarter of and the overall reduction in acquisition of fixed assets in the last several years as operations have been reduced 
other income  net 
other income in was approximately million and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
other income in was approximately million  consisting primarily of the million refund from sbc discussed above and approximately  of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
income taxes 
income tax expense in was  reflecting a provision for federal income tax expense related to a proposed adjustment by the internal revenue service irs relating to a prior year tax return under audit 
income tax benefit in was million 
this benefit resulted primarily from our ability to carry losses back to offset income in prior years and to receive refunds of income taxes paid in those years 
our effective tax rate for was approximately 
our effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of approximately 
the rates for both years differ from the statutory rates primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance in both years  as it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased to million from million 
call volume decreased to approximately million calls from approximately million calls 
these decreases resulted primarily from lower call volumes due to the expiration of contracts with sprint pcs and at t wireless 
our average revenue per call was approximately in and approximately in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses decreased to million from million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and data cost associated with servicing lower call volumes 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses increased to from  due primarily to a lower average revenue per call 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million resulting primarily from decreased advertising expense related to infone of approximately million and general cost cutting efforts 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in compared to in  primarily due to decreased revenues 
impairment loss 
as a result of changes in our business climate  primarily significantly reduced pricing of renewed wholesale contracts  we evaluated our fixed assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  as of december  we determined that the value of our fixed assets was impaired  thus  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million write down of those assets to estimated fair market value 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in other income  net 
other income in was approximately million  consisting primarily of the million refund from sbc discussed above and approximately  of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in other income consisted primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents of approximately  income taxes 
income tax benefit in and was million and million  respectively 
these benefits result primarily from our ability to carry losses back to offset income in prior years and to receive refunds of income taxes paid in those years 
our effective tax rates for and were tax benefits of approximately and  respectively 
these rates differ from the statutory rates primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance in both years  as it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash are recorded at cost which approximates their fair market value 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash including million of restricted cash compared to approximately million including million of restricted cash at december  the net decrease of million resulted primarily from net operating losses 
we have no outstanding debt 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  this change was primarily due to decreased net operating losses in cash flow from operations 
net cash used in operations was million in compared to net cash provided by operations of million in this difference of approximately million resulted primarily from net decreases in cash received from customers resulting from lower revenues in and a decrease in our federal income tax refund in these net decreases were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to or on behalf of employees  and a decrease in our use of cash to market and promote infone 
cash received from customers decreased by million in compared to and our income tax refund in was approximately million less than in cash paid to or on behalf of employees decreased by approximately million in compared to  and we paid approximately million less in than in to market and promote infone 
cash flow from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily resulting from conversion of short term investments to cash for use in operations  partially offset by cash used to secure a letter of credit and cash used for capital purchases 
in  cash used in investing activities included net purchases of approximately million of investment grade auction rate securities 
in and  capital expenditures were primarily for equipment to upgrade existing call centers and corporate networks and infrastructure 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was not significant in cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  resulting from proceeds from employee stock purchases 
future capital needs and resources 
the primary uses of our capital in the near future are expected to be primarily for working capital 
we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities in order to address varying business circumstances  including changes in volume and pricing and other provisions of customer contracts 
although cash on hand including restricted cash and short term investments at december  was approximately million  our operations and future activities  including additional restructuring efforts  will likely reduce available cash 
we have experienced net losses in each of the quarterly and annual periods since the first quarter of we expect to meet our cash requirements in using our existing cash and cash equivalents 
our management has developed plans to significantly reduce the direct cost of delivering our services  reduce our general and administrative overhead  aggressively pursue new and additional sources of revenues to support our reduced cost structure  and develop and grow our data services business 
there can be no assurance that management s plans will be successful 
in such event  we may attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity  although we cannot provide assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to execute our operations according to the plan or obtain additional financing  we may be forced to cease operations 
contractual obligations and commitments 
our contractual obligations are presented in the table below 
other than operating leases  we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 
payments due by period in thousands less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations total we generally lease our facilities through non cancelable operating leases extending for up to ten years 
from time to time  in the normal course of our business  we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   we had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of  related to our workers compensation program 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit for the same amount that is recorded as restricted cash 
this commitment expires on april  and is typically renewed on an annual basis 
effective april   the amount of the standby letter of credit and restricted cash will decrease to  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these contractual obligations and commitments are not reflected in our balance sheets 
effect of inflation inflation did not materially affect our business during the last several years 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements  those governing accounts receivable  the lives and recoverability of the carrying amount of equipment and other long lived assets  such as existing intangibles and goodwill  estimates involving the levels of our contingent liabilities for workers compensation and medical self insurance and estimates of current and deferred taxes owed may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation and uncertainty 
accounts receivable 
our wholesale customer base has primarily consisted of large wireless telephone carriers in the united states 
as such  we have had minimal risk of uncollectibility  at any point in time  related to outstanding accounts receivable with these customers 
we have not experienced significant collection issues or write offs related to these customers 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few of these wholesale customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of them could adversely impact collection of our accounts receivable and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results 
in addition  our emerging data services business is expected to generate receivables from customers that may not be as financially stable as our large carrier customers which may expose us to greater risk of uncollectible receivables than we have experienced in the past 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangibles 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including patents and trademarks and internally developed software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
at such time  we estimate the future cash flows expected from use of such assets and their eventual disposition and  if lower than the carrying amounts  adjust the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
because of our changing business conditions  including lower wholesale prices and dependence on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues  our estimates of future cash flows to be generated from our operations could change materially  resulting in the need for us to record additional impairment charges 
in addition  as a result of our changing business conditions  we expect to adjust personnel  call centers and network capacities 
if any of these activities result in certain of our assets no longer being used in operations  we may need to record an additional impairment charge 
as a result of certain of the circumstances noted above  we evaluated our fixed assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as of december  we determined that the value of our fixed assets was impaired  thus  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million write down of those assets to their estimated fair market value 
as a result of the decision by nextel to terminate its contract with us  as discussed under significant events above  we evaluated our fixed assets and intangibles as of december  for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
our evaluation determined that the assets were not impaired as of december under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances may have indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
when we performed our evaluation of goodwill under sfas no 
in  our analysis indicated that our estimate of the fair value of our business  as determined by the market price of our stock  was less than its carrying value  therefore  the book value of goodwill and related intangibles of approximately million was written off during the fourth quarter of self insurance reserves 
we self insure a portion of our workers compensation and employee medical insurance programs 
we purchase stop loss coverage at varying levels in order to mitigate our potential future losses 
the nature of these liabilities  which may not fully manifest themselves for several years  requires significant judgment 
we evaluate pending workers compensation and medical claims periodically to determine the reasonableness of the reserves we have recorded for such claims 
our evaluation includes estimates of potential incurred but unreported claims as well as factors that may cause original estimates of such claims to increase over time  such as available claims data and historical trends and experience  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
we adjust these reserves if events or changes in circumstances indicate that ultimate payments related to the claims will be more than the recorded reserves 
at december   we have reserved approximately million and  related to our workers compensation and medical programs  respectively 
while we believe that the amounts reserved for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims and costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
due to differences in the recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we estimate the likelihood of recovery of these assets  which is dependent on future levels of profitability and enacted tax rates 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  we would be required to take a charge to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets  which could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december  and  a valuation allowance reduced net deferred tax assets to zero 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  which requires companies to recognize in their statements of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
we will adopt sfas no 
r starting in our first quarter of we are still evaluating the effects that adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid resources are invested in money market instruments and short term debt securities  and therefore  the fair market value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  these funds were invested in overnight money market instruments or debt securities with short term effective maturities at december  and were redeemable on a daily or monthly basis 
all of the underlying investments in the money market fund had maturities of three months or less 
a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
