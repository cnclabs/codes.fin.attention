item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and software to the global semiconductor industry 
our primary product line is automated wafer probing equipment and related network software to manage information from that equipment 
in conjunction with automated test systems from other suppliers  our semiconductor manufacturing customers use our wafer probers and network software to quality test semiconductor wafers 
electroglas installed base is one of the largest in the industry  with over  wafer probers sold 
as part of our strategy to be a comprehensive semiconductor test solutions provider  we also sell strip test handlers  which are built on our proven prober technology 
the strip test handlers expand our available markets by providing solutions to the final test segment for today s latest packaging technologies and test processes 
starting in  we refocused our company on our core competency of wafer probers and extending our wafer probing technologies throughout the back end of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
in december  we introduced a new extended performance mm wafer prober  the 
in january  we introduced a new mm prober  the eg  that represents a major advancement in prober design and automation and is focused on providing better performance than currently available competitors products 
our customers include both chip manufacturers and contract test companies 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
in addition  our mm wafer probers have not yet achieved broad market acceptance  which has resulted in a significant loss in market share 
our initial mm product  the  served the small market for mm parametric and process development applications but did not adequately meet customers requirements for high volume production test which is the large majority of the mm prober market 
the new mm prober  the eg  was developed to serve this much larger production test market 
to stay competitive  grow our business over the long term  improve our gross margins  and generate operating cash flows  we must continue to invest in new technologies and product enhancements and at the same time  as necessary  rapidly adjust our expense structure during the hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles 
due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor equipment industry and the resulting market pressures  we are focusing our efforts in the following areas controlling and aligning our costs and revenues to move to break even and then profitable levels of operation  including positive operating cash flows  developing successful products and services to meet market windows in our target markets  successfully completing new customer evaluations of our new mm and strip test handler products  preparing ourselves for increases in customer demand while at the same time maintaining expense control and limiting increases in our cost structure  and expanding our sales  applications  and service capabilities in asia 
there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful 
in order to become profitable  our market share for our products must improve

critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  warranties  allowance for doubtful accounts  guarantee obligations  tax allowances and reserves  and accruals for such items as restructuring reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
for more detail about these accounting policies  see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of our equipment when we have received a customer purchase order or contract  when we have delivered the products or services  when we can be assured of the total purchase price without making significant concessions  and when we are assured of our ability to collect from our customer 
in recognizing revenue we make certain assumptions and estimates  namely i we consider a new system routinely accepted in the marketplace when three to five successful installations  based on our acceptance criteria  have been put into customer production  ii we consider systems delivered separately from options to have value to our customers on a stand alone basis if the options have a unique price assigned and are not significant to the total amount of the order and the options are not fundamental to the functionality of the system  iii we consider systems delivered separately from installation and training to have value to our customers on a stand alone basis because the equipment can readily be sold by the customer  customers are capable of installing our systems without the support of our installers  installation and training are routine and inconsequential to the total value of the transaction  and these services are routinely sold on a stand alone basis  and iv for most customers we assume that  based on past history  we will continue to collect from them without payment or product concessions  despite the fact that they may have larger financial size relative to us and despite our dependence on them in a heavily concentrated industry 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market estimated net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically review the carrying value of inventories and non cancelable purchase commitments by reviewing sales forecasts  material usage requirements  and by reviewing the impact of changes in technology on our products including engineering design changes 
these forecasts of changes in technology  future sales  and pricing are estimates 
we may record charges to write down inventories based on these reviews and forecasts 
if there is weak demand in the semiconductor equipment markets and orders fall below our forecasts  additional write downs of inventories may be required which will negatively impact gross margins 
inventory impairment charges are considered to permanently establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable  except when the associated inventory is disposed of or sold 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of thirteen months from the date of shipment and we accrue a current liability for the estimated cost of warranty 
for our established products  this accrual is based on historical experience  and for our newer products  this accrual is based on estimates from similar products 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience unforeseen technical problems with our products in future periods to meet our product warranty requirements  revisions to our estimated cost of warranty may be required  and our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we closely monitor the collection of our accounts receivable and record a general allowance for doubtful accounts against aged accounts and a specific reserve for identified amounts that we believe are not recoverable 
we sell primarily to large  well established semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test companies and we have not experienced significant accounts receivable losses in the past 
we have  however  from time to time experienced slowdowns in receivable collections  especially during semiconductor equipment down cycles  as customers extend their payment schedules to conserve their cash balances 
if our customers continue to experience down cycles or if their financial conditions deteriorate  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if a customer demonstrates a pattern of renegotiating terms or requesting concessions prior to payment  we would defer revenue until the price was considered fixed and determinable 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
tax valuation allowances and reserves we establish estimates for these allowances and reserves based on historical experience and other assumptions 
it is our policy to accrue for tax exposures or to release tax reserves in the period in which the facts and circumstances arise that suggest that the valuation allowances or reserves should be modified 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of equipment and leasehold improvements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of overall market conditions and our market share 
changes in these estimates and business divestures could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the long lived assets  thereby requiring us to record additional asset write downs in the future 
charges related to asset impairments are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

service revenue  included in aftermarket prober products and service was of net sales for the year ended may   of net sales for the five months ended may  and less than of net sales during the years ended december  and and the five months ended may  net sales of our products are as follows years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited prober and test handling systems inspection products test floor management software products dfm and fab solutions software products aftermarket prober products and service net sales were down in from this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of prober system sales due to slow customer qualification and acceptance of the new mm prober product  partially offset by a increase in average selling prices 
net sales were up in from this increase was primarily due to higher prober system sales  largely in our mm prober product lines  and higher average selling prices  as customers resumed their capital spending in response to indications of a market recovery 
sales of our test floor management software products increased in due to the release of a new platform in late these increases in prober systems sales and test floor management software in over were partially offset by the elimination of sales in other product lines in we sold our dfm and fab solutions software product lines in the third quarter of and our optical inspection product line in the fourth quarter of net sales were down for the five months ended may  versus the prior year 
these decreases were primarily due to lower system sales  largely our mm prober product lines  as customers delayed orders in the first five months of and electroglas was in a major product transition as customers began evaluation of our new mm and mm products 
this decrease in volume was partially offset by higher average selling prices period over period 
the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets  which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
as a result of uncertainties in this market environment  any rescheduling or cancellation of planned capital purchases by our customers will cause our sales to fluctuate 
sales to related parties are priced in the same manner as sales to other customers 
net sales amounts and as a percentage of sales were as follows years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited europe asia international north america we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales and fluctuate as individual manufacturers and semiconductor test companies address their capacity needs at differing stages of the semiconductor demand cycle 
during through  we experienced weakness in sales across all of our major geographic regions due to industry conditions and slow customer acceptance of our mm products 
gross profit years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited gross profit gross profit as a of net sales the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to decrease in the volume of prober system sales 
the improvement in gross profit in compared to was due to higher unit sales volumes and higher average selling prices 
additionally  manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of sales were lower in than as a result of our relocation of manufacturing operations from the united states to singapore and other restructuring efforts begun in late and completed in mid the year also included a million write down of inventories 
the decrease in gross profit in the five months ended may  compared to the same period in was primarily due to lower unit sales volumes despite higher average selling prices 
also included in gross profit for the five month period ended may was a one time warranty prov benefit of million 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventories by evaluating material usage and manufacturing requirements to determine inventory obsolescence and excess quantities  and we reduce the carrying value of these inventories when appropriate 
the write downs in fiscal were due to the obsolescence of discontinued and sold product lines as we focused our business on our core prober products 
we generally warrant our products for a period of thirteen months from the date of shipment and accrue the estimated cost of warranty upon shipment 
in  due to the sale of the inspection product lines  the accrued liability for estimated cost of warranty was increased by million for additional costs to outsource support of customers through the end of their warranty term and for additional warranties associated with discontinuing and selling the product line 
we believe that our gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including changes in demand for semiconductors  competitive pressures on average selling prices  product mix  the level of software sales  our share of the available market and excess manufacturing capacity costs 
continued weak demand and changes in market conditions may cause orders to be below forecasts  which may result in additional excess inventory  which would cause additional write downs of inventories and would negatively impact gross profit margins 
engineering  research and development expenses er d years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited er d er d as a of net sales in versus  the decrease in er d was primarily due to decreased spending on materials combined with a reduction in headcount following completion of major new product development efforts 
as a percentage of net sales  er d expenses was flat in due to lower net sales despite lower spending than in versus  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and related costs and a reduction associated with the product lines sold in the second half of  partially offset by increased spending on materials and services

in the five months ended may  versus  the decrease in expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to reduced employee headcount and related costs as a result of restructuring efforts 
as a percentage of net sales  er d expenses increased for the five month period ended may as a result of lower net sales despite lower spending than the same period in during these hard to predict cyclical semiconductor equipment demand cycles  we intend to control discretionary expenses and continue investing in our new product programs 
engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees  and other costs associated with our ongoing efforts in hardware and software product development and enhancement 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited sg a sg a as a of net sales in versus the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to reduced sg a costs for sarbanes oxley consulting and audit fees 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased in as a result of lower net sales despite lower spending versus in versus  the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to the non recurrence of an additional rent charge of million recorded in the first quarter of related to the amortization of the deficiency between the fair value and the guaranteed residual value of our san jose campus 
in addition  savings in sg a expenses during included reduced salaries and other cost savings as a result of headcount reductions  spending restrictions and other cost control measures 
these savings during were partially offset by a million increase in sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased in as a result of the effect of higher sales and an additional as a result of lower spending 
in the five months ended may  versus  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to reduced facilities costs as a result of the sale of our san jose  california campus in january in addition  the company recorded a one time benefit of million in  which was of sales in the five month period ended may   as a result of the settlement of a royalty obligation 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased for the five month period ended may as a result of lower net sales 
sg a expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  travel expenses  advertising and other promotion expenses  facilities expenses  legal expenses and other infrastructure costs 
restructuring charges during and  we announced restructuring plans to reduce our workforce and to exit certain facilities in connection with the relocation of our manufacturing operations to singapore to better align our cost structure with the market demand for our products in response to the continued semiconductor equipment downturn 
in the second half of  we closed additional office facilities and completed workforce reductions related to these closures 
in the second quarter of  we further reduced workforce in our united states and european operations 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in  primarily for severance packages 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to office space reductions and severance packages 
during  we recorded a million restructuring charge resulting from workforce reductions 
impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed impairment tests as of december   and  which compared currently utilized property and equipment and non current assets net book values with the expected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the assets were sufficient to recover the net book value of these assets 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge on fixed assets no longer in use 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our san jose campus to integrated device technology for approximately million and we recorded a million impairment charge 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge on fixed assets no longer in use 
due to continued declines in real estate values in the san jose area  management concluded as of december  that there were indicators of impairment for the portion of the corporate campus that was not currently being utilized 
based on management s evaluation and the results of an independent appraisal firm  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the unused portion of the corporate campus 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge for fixed assets that were no longer in use 
although we do not anticipate that we will be required to record additional impairment charges  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the severity of these cycles is difficult to predict 
during a down cycle  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions  which could affect our net sales and the sufficiency of estimated future cash flows to recover the net book value of these assets and could require us to record additional impairment charges 
gains on sales of product lines in july  we sold our dfm and fab solutions software product lines and related assets to fei company fei for million in cash plus the assumption by fei of liabilities of million 
in  we recorded a gain on this sale of million  after deducting from the consideration the book value of the assets sold  the transaction and other related costs  and our obligation to fei under the sale agreement s indemnification provisions 
in november  we sold our inspection product line and related assets to ats systems oregon  inc ats for million in cash  net of selling expenses  plus the assumption by ats of million of warranty obligations 
in  we recorded a gain on this sale of million  after deducting from the consideration the book value of the assets sold  the transaction and other related costs  and our obligation to ats under the agreement s indemnification provisions 
interest income years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited interest income the increase in over and for the five month period ended may  over the same period in primarily resulted from higher average cash and investment balances resulting from the proceeds of sale of our san jose  california campus in january combined with higher yields on investments 
the decrease in over was principally due to lower average yearly cash and short term investment balances as a result of cash used in operations 
interest expense years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited interest expense interest expense is comprised of primarily interest on our convertible subordinated notes notes 
the decrease in over primarily resulted from the repurchase of million of the notes in the year over year decrease from to of million relates to the non cash interest expense charge related to the beneficial conversion feature triggered during the first quarter of related to our notes see note  convertible subordinated notes and debt conversion expense 
gain on sale of long term investment in the fourth quarter of  we sold our minority equity investment in cascade microtech  inc in connection with their initial public offering 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale and we recorded a net gain of million 
gain on settlement of long term liability in the third quarter of  we recognized a million gain on the settlement of a long term liability to our former parent company gsx that reduced our amounts payable under a tax benefit sharing agreement from million to an aggregate of million to be paid over seven quarters starting in the fourth quarter of as of may   there is one payment of million remaining to be paid 
debt conversion expense during may  we exchanged million of our notes for  shares of common stock and million in cash in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
at the conversion price of per share  the million of notes exchanged would have been convertible into  shares of common stock 
for accounting purposes  the additional  shares of common stock  valued at million  and the million cash paid was considered an inducement for the holders to convert their notes  which combined with unamortized bond costs of million and transaction costs of million  required us to record a non operating debt conversion expense of million during the year ended may  provision benefit for income taxes years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited provision benefit for income taxes the income tax benefit resulted primarily from a release of tax reserves related to transfer pricing issues 
the income tax provision for  the five months ended may  and the five months ended may  resulted from taxes assessed on the income of various foreign branches 
the income tax benefit resulted from a reversal of previously recorded income tax reserves based on changes in estimated exposures in certain tax jurisdictions 
realization of our deferred tax assets depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million was required at may  in october of  the american jobs protection act was signed into law 
certain provisions of this act allow multinational companies to repatriate cash related foreign earnings at a favorable rate if used to create or maintain jobs in the united states 
at may   there are no plans to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries as the only cash maintained in these entities is for working capital purposes 
any repatriation of foreign earnings would have an immaterial effect on income taxes 
san jose  california corporate campus financing  purchase  impairments and sale in march  we entered into a million  five year synthetic lease for approximately acres of land in san jose  california 
in january  we provided the lessors with a notice to purchase property by march in december  we received a fair market appraisal of the property for million  million less than the guaranteed residual lease value of million 
under eitf  implementation issues in accounting for leasing transactions involving special purpose entities  beginning on the date the deficiency becomes probable  the expected deficiency is accrued by the lessee using the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
because we made a determination in december to purchase the leased assets by march  the gross lease payments were calculated over the remaining four months of the lease 
thus  we began amortizing the million deficiency at million per month effective december and recorded million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of we completed the purchase of the property in march the land and buildings were recorded at fair value plus closing costs  approximately million  and the accrued rent of million was paid 
as a result of the purchase  depreciation expense increased by approximately million per year  and rent expense and interest income decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  per year based on current interest rates  effective the second quarter of in december  we entered into an agreement to sell our san jose campus to integrated device technology idt on january  for million cash  net of closing costs  with a leaseback of portions of the campus through june we measured the fair value of the land and buildings as of december  based upon the sale price net of closing costs and recorded a million impairment charge 
under the leaseback portion of the sales agreement  there were no rental payments from date of the sale to june  the fair value of base rent and common area charges of million were recorded as a prepaid expense in january and were amortized over the term of occupancy 
liquidity and capital resources years ended five months ended may  december  may  may  in thousands unaudited cash and cash equivilents short term investments restricted cash long term investments total cash used in operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities operating loss adjustments for non cash charges and gains operating loss before non cash items we present operating loss before non cash items because it is meaningful in explaining our cash used in operating activities 
operating activities cash used in operating activities increased in by million from million in to million primarily due to a million increase in operating loss before non cash items depreciation  amortization  inventory write downs  stock based compensation expense  restructuring charges  impairment charges and gains on sales of product lines from million in to million in additionally  the increase in net cash used in operations in resulted from an increase of million in accounts receivable due to late quarter shipments combined with an increase of million in inventory from increased material purchases to support forecast demand 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
cash used in operating activities improved million in from million in primarily due to a million improvement in operating loss before non cash items 
cash used in operating activities during the five months ended may  increased million over the same period in  primarily due to an increased operating loss before non cash items of million period over period  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
adjustments included in our net operating loss before non cash items in consisted primarily of million depreciation and amortization  million of inventory write downs and million of stock based compensation charges 
these non cash charges in decreased by million from million in the adjustments consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million of impairment charges  and million of inventory write downs 
these non cash charges in decreased by million from million in the adjustments consisted primarily of million depreciation and amortization  million of impairment charges and million of inventory write downs  partially offset by million of gains on sales of product lines 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities in was million an increase of million over largely due to liquidation of investments due to our increased use of cash in operations as a result of larger accounts receivables and inventory balances 
cash provided by investing activities was million in the five months ended may  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the same period in this increase was principally due to the completion of the sale of the san jose campus assets in january for million in cash 
this was partially offset by million net increase in investments and million in capital expenditures primarily for our new san jose  california headquarters location 
cash provided by investing activities was million in largely due to the s our investment in cascade microtech  inc see note  sale of investment for million in december our use of investments decreased by million in to million as compared to million in due to our decreased use of cash in operations 
financing activities cash used in financing activities in was million  largely from million paid in the exchange of million of our convertible subordinated notes notes in may for  shares of our common stock and cash in privately negotiated transactions with note holders 
cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively  primarily from proceeds of sales of common stock to employees 
in the five months ended may   the company repurchased million of the notes with a million net book value for million of cash 
cash contractual obligations are as follows as of may  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments settlement agreements interest payments on convertible subordinated notes principal payment on convertible subordinated notes total purchase commitments include million of purchase orders that are cancelable 
in january  we entered into a three year operating lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in singapore with annual lease payments of approximately million 
this lease was renewed at the same rate in december we have an option to renew this lease after it expires in march for two years at prevailing market between million and million annually 
in february  we entered into a five year operating lease for a  square foot corporate headquarters building in san jose  california 
payments are due under this new lease as follows million in less than year  million in years and nil in years 
line of credit in the third quarter of  we established a line of credit agreement with comerica bank under which we may borrow up to million based upon eligible accounts receivable balances 
this line of credit is secured by certain of our assets and requires that we maintain certain minimum financial covenants 
the bank has provided a waiver for one financial covenant that was not met by the company as of may  the company currently maintains cash deposits of million that will be considered restricted as compensating balances to the extent we borrow against the line of credit 
to date  the company has not borrowed against this line 
liquidity our principal source of liquidity as of may  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
during  we continued to emphasize reduction of our utilization of cash  including improving gross margins on sales  maintaining spending controls and additional headcount reductions 
we currently anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents at may  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures to support planned activities through fiscal the demand for our products follows the semiconductor test markets which remain highly cyclical and difficult to forecast 
we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and will take further action as necessary to align our operations and reduce expenses 
external financing vehicles have been and are expected to continue to be available to us 
indemnifications we have indemnified idt for two years with respect to representations and warranties made by us related to the sale of our san jose campus 
the limit of electroglas liability for breach of the representations and warranties was million in the sales agreement  and a million reserve was recorded in january for the net present value of the company s guarantee obligations under these indemnification provisions

this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not c transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
the company does not believe adoption of statement in june will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we plan to adopt eitf in june we are currently evaluating the eitf could have on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt fin in june management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the provisions of fin item a
