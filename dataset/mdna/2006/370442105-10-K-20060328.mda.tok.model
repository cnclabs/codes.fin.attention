item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gm is primarily engaged in automotive production and marketing and financing and insurance operations 
gm designs  manufactures  and markets vehicles worldwide  having its largest operating presence in north america 
gm s finance and insurance operations primarily relate to general motors acceptance corporation gmac  a wholly owned subsidiary of gm  which provides a broad range of financial services  including automotive finance and mortgage products and services 
automotive industry in  global industry vehicle sales to retail and fleet customers were million units  representing a increase over we expect industry sales to be between million and million units in gm s worldwide vehicle sales for were million units compared to million units in this represents a global market share of for  down slightly from gm s global market share of 
in  gm posted market share gains in three of its four automotive regions  with the exception of gm north america gmna where gm s market share declined 
over the past five years  the global automotive industry has experienced consistent year to year increases  growing approximately from to much of this growth is attributable to the continued development of emerging markets such as china 
in the united states  where gm has its largest presence  industry vehicle sales totaled million units  representing a slight increase from the us sales level of million units 
while the us industry has experienced annual sales volumes of approximately million units for the past eight years  management believes that competition among automotive manufacturers involving price  incentive promotions  and financing offers has been a very important factor in maintaining this level of industry sales 
gm s market share in the united states was for  down from in  due in part to declines in sales of full size utilities  mid sized utilities and mid sized cars 
the overall us industry wide proportion of light trucks as a percentage of total us vehicle sales has continued to increase over the past several decades 
light trucks include all pickups  vans  utilities  and cross over utilities derived from car platforms 
in  light trucks accounted for only of the overall us vehicle market 
by  light trucks had surpassed cars to take over of the market for the first time 
despite the negative influence of fuel prices  in light trucks  including the growing segment of cross over vehicles  still accounted for of the us vehicle market  compared to and respectively in and financial results gm s consolidated net sales and revenues fell to billion in from billion in gm incurred a consolidated net loss in of billion  compared to net income of billion in the unfavorable results were driven primarily by losses at gmna 
gmac s net income in declined to billion  compared to billion in gm s results of operations in were most significantly affected by the following trends and significant events gmna market share and product mix while industry wide north american vehicle sales grew slightly  gmna s vehicle production declined in to million units due in part to gm s efforts to reduce high dealer inventory levels  and its market share decreased by percentage points 
compounding this decline in volumes was the effect of unfavorable product mix  whereby gm had fewer sales of higher margin large trucks and large cars  due to a combination of volatility of consumer demand and the anticipated introduction of new truck models to replace products at the end of their lifecycles

table of contents general motors corporation and subsidiaries financial results concluded delphi chapter proceedings for the fourth quarter of  gm recorded a charge of billion billion after tax as an estimate of contingent exposures relating to the chapter filing of delphi corporation delphi  including under the benefit guarantees for certain former gm us employees who transferred to delphi in connection with its spin off from gm 
gm believes that the range of these contingent exposures is between billion and billion  with amounts near the low end of the range considered more possible than amounts near the high end of the range assuming an agreement is reached among gm  delphi  and delphi s unions 
these views reflect gm s current assessment that it is unlikely that a chapter process will result in both a termination of delphi s pension plan and complete elimination of its opeb plans 
gmna restructuring and global asset impairments as a result of the north american manufacturing restructuring actions announced in november  gm recorded an after tax charge of billion 
this charge includes billion associated with the employees and million for the non cash write down of property  plants and equipment that we currently believe are likely to be impacted by the actions 
the employee costs represent our best estimate of the wage and benefits costs that we will incur for qualified employees under the jobs bank provisions of the current labor agreement through the date of its expiration in september  plus estimated costs to be paid thereafter 
we have been discussing these provisions with the international union  united automobile  aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw in an effort to develop an agreed upon accelerated attrition program that  among other things  would not require or entitle participants to also be eligible for the jobs bank 
as part of these discussions  on march   gm  delphi and the uaw reached a tentative agreement intended to reduce the number of us hourly employees through an accelerated attrition program 
the agreement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court of delphi s participation in the agreement 
if so approved  the agreement will provide for a combination of early retirement programs and other incentives designed to help reduce employment levels at gm  which may have the effect of reducing the number of employees that are or will be in the jobs bank 
this attrition program is expected to result in additional charges being recorded in as employees at locations that were not included in the north american manufacturing restructuring actions announced in november agree to participate 
under the agreement  gm and the uaw also agreed to discuss other options to address remaining surplus people at specific locations and all areas in which gm and the uaw can work together to close gm s competitive gap with its foreign competition and reduce gm s structural costs 
in addition  gm s results reflect the write down of the corporation s investment in fuji heavy industries  ltd 
fhi of million after tax considering the original impairment of million and a gain on sale of million due to the appreciation of the stock following the write down 
furthermore  gm recorded after tax charges of million for plant and facility asset impairments within its automotive regions 
health care cost escalation health care in the united states is one of our biggest competitive challenges  and if we do not make progress on structurally fixing this issue  it could be a long term threat to our company 
in  gm was challenged with the compound impact of escalating health care cost rates and falling discount rates used to determine future health care liabilities 
as a result of these factors  in  gm s us other postretirement employee benefits opeb expense  consisting of retiree health care and life insurance  increased to billion  an increase of more than billion from strategy the size of gm s loss  most of which related to its north american operations  clearly demonstrates the need for significant changes in gm s business model 
a large part of these losses arise from gm s huge legacy cost burden and the difficulty of adjusting structural costs in line with falling revenue 
legacy costs are ii 
table of contents general motors corporation and subsidiaries strategy continued primarily related to the cost of benefits provided to retired employees and their dependents  and costs associated with employees and their dependents of businesses divested by gm 
structural costs are those costs that do not vary with production and include all costs other than material  freight  and policy and warranty costs 
structural costs include  among other things  the cost of unionized employees 
the top priority for gm is to return its north american operations to profitability and positive cash flow as soon as possible 
gm has been systematically and aggressively implementing its four point turnaround plan for gmna s business 
the four elements of this plan include product excellence continue to raise the bar in the execution of great cars and trucks revitalize sales and marketing strategy offer customers the best value in the industry accelerate cost reductions and quality improvements improve gm s cost position and reduce our breakeven point in response to an intensely competitive environment address health care burden reduce legacy cost disadvantages to date gm has been focusing on restructuring its operations  and has already taken a number of steps to improve its performance in a more competitive global environment 
a key driver of these efforts is the globalization of our principal business functions  including more aggressive engineering  product development  manufacturing and purchasing 
in addition  we backed up our commitment to great cars and trucks by raising our related capital expenditures in  and we intend to maintain this commitment going forward 
we are endeavoring to revitalize our sales and marketing strategy to more clearly focus customer recognition on our brands  align our distribution channels  and refocus our marketing efforts on the quality of our cars and trucks and the value they offer in price  features and performance 
in the health care area  gm announced in october a historic agreement with the uaw that will  among other things  reduce its health care obligations for retired hourly employees 
in february  gm announced it would increase the us salaried workforce s participation in the cost of health care  capping gm s contributions to salaried retiree health care at the level of expenditures 
in march  gm announced the details of its plan to substantially alter the pension benefits for current us salaried employees  under which gm will freeze accrued benefits in the current plan and implement a reduced defined benefit plan for some salaried employees and a new defined contribution plan for the other salaried employees 
as mentioned above  gm announced a north american restructuring plan in november that will impact multiple manufacturing facilities 
this gmna restructuring initiative will reduce excess capacity by one million units and will reduce manufacturing employment levels by approximately  employees 
as a result of this initiative and other cost reduction actions  we currently expect to reduce structural costs in north america by an average of billion per year on a running rate basis by the end of and to reduce net material costs by billion in we expect billion of the structural cost reduction to be realized during calendar year further information about these matters may be found in the gm north american restructuring plan discussion starting on page ii gm s objective is to reduce its global structural costs to of automotive revenue by  down from its current level of approximately 
in order to achieve this objective  we need to go beyond the gmna turnaround plan and accomplish capacity rationalization and other efficiency measures on a global basis 
our management believes that the four elements of the gmna turnaround plan  as well as global benchmarking of best competitive practices for major automotive processes and gm s economy of scale  make this global structural cost reduction target a realistic objective 
we believe that managing our business on a global  functional basis will enable us to leverage product development spending  consolidate our brand structure  share best practices throughout the corporation  and optimize our manufacturing  supply and engineering footprint 
accomplishing this structural cost reduction is critical to gm s future success 
ii 
table of contents general motors corporation and subsidiaries strategy concluded in addition to the gmna turnaround activities  gm plans to continue to address other important strategic issues  including the bankruptcy of our largest supplier  delphi 
this situation presents significant risks to gm  including disruption in the supply of automotive systems  components  and parts  gm receiving only a portion of amounts owed by delphi to gm  and obligations in excess of amounts recognized by gm in in connection with benefit guarantees 
this situation also presents opportunities for gm  including reducing  over the long term  the significant cost penalty gm incurs in obtaining parts from delphi  as well as improving the quality of systems  components and parts gm procures from delphi as a result of the restructuring of delphi through the chapter process 
the pursuit of a possible sale of a controlling interest in gmac with the goal of delinking gmac s credit rating from gm s credit rating and renewing gmac s access to low cost financing  and the exploration of strategic and structural alternatives for rescap 
negotiations with the uaw in connection with the expiration of our collective bargaining agreement in september restructuring initiatives in other areas  including brazil  europe  and australia 
gm believes that it has sufficient balance sheet strength to fund its short and medium term cash needs and implement its four point turnaround plan and other strategic objectives under reasonably foreseeable circumstances 
over the long term  we believe that gm s ability to meet its capital requirements will primarily depend on its successful execution of its four point turnaround plan and the return of its north american operations to profitability and positive cash flow  and its ability to execute the globalization of its principal business functions 
as of december   gm s automotive and other operations had cash  marketable securities  and readily available assets of the voluntary employees beneficiary association veba trust totaling billion  and its debt is principally long term 
we note that our cash balance varies from time to time during the calendar year and  in particular  our cash balance is generally materially lower during the third quarter as a result of product changeovers and the annual shutdown of our north american manufacturing facilities for approximately two weeks during that period 
gmac continues to maintain adequate liquidity with cash reserve balances at december  of billion  including billion in marketable securities with maturities greater than days 
in addition  gm has recently implemented a number of cost cutting and cash saving initiatives intended to help maintain adequate liquidity  including the recent reduction of its quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
nevertheless  there are significant risks to gm s liquidity position  including the possibility of an extended labor dispute at delphi  any inability to access or amend or replace our existing standby bank credit facility  any claims that may be successfully asserted against gm under various financing agreements in view of gm s recent restatement of its prior financial statements  the further deterioration in gmac s credit rating leading to a higher cost of capital  the failure to improve our competitive position through the labor negotiations  and the payment to delphi employees of any amounts incremental to previously announced charges for contingent exposures relating to delphi s chapter filing 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these events could severely threaten our liquidity position and threaten the successful implementation of our turnaround plan 
there is uncertainty regarding our future earnings given the potential that some of these matters have to affect our earnings  both positively and negatively 
we put our four point turnaround plan in place in  and we have a tremendous sense of urgency in executing the elements of the plan to the highest degree possible in and the coming years 
ii 
table of contents general motors corporation and subsidiaries business environment gm views the following factors  many of which are important to the execution of gmna s four point turnaround plan  as the most significant drivers of its near term financial results continued demand for gm s most profitable products and the maintenance of a strong product mix  the introduction of innovative new products on a timely cadence  through the integration of global architectures  engineering  and procurement efforts  the implementation of measures for reducing structural costs  offsetting legacy and health care burdens  maintenance of sufficient balance sheet strength and liquidity  and other factors affecting gm s financing and insurance operations fio reportable operating segment results  including interest rates  credit ratings  and demand for mortgage financing 
in addition to these drivers  the most significant risks to the execution of our business strategy and improved financial performance are discussed above under risk factors 
basis of presentation this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the gmac annual report on form k for the period ended december   filed separately with the sec  part i  item  business and part ii  item selected financial data  item md a and
