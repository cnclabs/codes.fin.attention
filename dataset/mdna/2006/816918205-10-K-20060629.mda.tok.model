our business we are a global provider of custom solutions that leverage right channelingsm  a methodology for ensuring that companies make informed choices for multi channel communication that support their business goals and customer expectations 
we offer call and contact center solutions for customer acquisition  customer service  service intervention and technical support 
we use modern customer contact solution centers  coupled with our state of the art proprietary software systems and other non proprietary technology  to provide domestic and international support services and technology solutions to our primary target markets consisting of small to mid sized companies or divisions of large companies that outsource customer and technical support  and or companies which may or may not outsource but are interested in deploying our right channeling and other unique offerings 
we conduct our principal business operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries  sento technical services corporation and xtrasource acquisition  inc significant events xtrasource acquisition effective october   through our wholly owned subsidiary xtrasource acquisition  inc  we acquired substantially all of the assets of xtrasource  a non affiliated  privately held delaware corporation with approximately million in annual sales 
we have agreed to pay the owners of xtrasource a quarterly contingent earnout of of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from the acquired xtrasource operations the earnout for the quarterly periods between the closing and september  with a maximum cap of million 
earnout payments are subject to various reductions and offset rights including reductions for debt payments to secured and unsecured creditors and net working capital adjustment 
we granted the owners of xtrasource a line of credit of no more than  to enable xtrasource to pay costs and expenses associated with closing its brazilian subsidiary  which we did not acquire and for which we did not assume its liabilities  and for ordinary expenses related to the transaction 
amounts drawn on the line of credit will be deducted from earnout payments 
our consolidated operating results contain the operating results of the acquired business for the periods beginning on or after october  because of better than expected performance of the acquired xtrasource operations during the first year since the acquisition  we increased our estimate of the earnout in the quarter ended december  by  and recorded this adjustment as a true up of the purchase price as permitted under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
this adjustment brings the total accrued contingent consideration for the purchase to  in conjunction with this true up we also recognized a deferred foreign tax liability of  related to non deductible amortization in our european tax jurisdictions 
this deferred consideration true up and related deferred foreign tax liability resulted in a corresponding increase in our intangible assets  which resulted in increased amortization expense beginning during our quarter ended december  going forward  all true ups to the earnout liability will be recognized in our operating results 
facilities consolidation on january   we announced our intention to consolidate our utah call center operations into a single combined center 
we completed this move during june we believe this consolidation enabled us to increase our efficiencies and reduce the cost of providing our services over the long term 
during the quarter ended june   we incurred moving costs of approximately  and a write down of related leasehold improvements of  in addition  we accrued rent expense for the remaining lease term on the vacated utah centers approximately  during the three months ended june  the above costs are identified as restructuring charges in our statement of operations for fiscal in addition  we reviewed the viability of the future utilization of our green river  wyoming facility that is currently not in use 
based on our review  we determined that it would not be economically feasible to reopen this facility in the future and therefore have included the future costs associated with this facility  in our restructuring accrual during fiscal the restructuring charges discussed above had a negative impact on our operating results during the first quarter of fiscal job training incentive reimbursement in october  we applied for and were awarded job training reimbursements from the state of new mexico s job training incentive program jtip of up to million for training wages to be incurred for positions in our albuquerque contact solution center 
based on our significant growth in the quarter  we amended that original request in december and were awarded up to an additional  of jtip funding for another positions 
we also applied for and were awarded up to  of jtip funding for an additional positions anticipated to be hired between january and april as the ramp up of our albuquerque operations continues 
all of these awards are based on a reimbursement of between and of the employees training wages 
the majority of the employees are contact and technical support agents who  among other requirements  must each complete training hours before we can submit for reimbursement of their wages 
we received our first cash payment in april we anticipate that these cash payments will continue during fiscal under gaap  we accrued  of jtip funds during fiscal the accrual is recognized as an offset to cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended march  the jtip funds have already been appropriated and reserved by the state of new mexico for us 
if our employees complete the required training hours  we can file the appropriate statutory claims requests to obtain the funds 
these awards are one time events that will be recognized over the periods that we incur the related training costs 
we expect that most of the remaining costs will be incurred during fiscal the jtip funds  if received  will help reduce actual training costs as well as partially offset the impact of lower margin training revenue as we continue to ramp up our albuquerque site 
application of critical accounting policies management discussed with our audit committee the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
basis of presentation and consolidation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
included within these policies are our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  credit risk and stock based compensation 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and as a result  actual results will differ  and may differ materially  from these estimates 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been discussed  and are reviewed each year  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generate revenue by delivering customer support and or technical assistance to users of our clients products and or services by providing communications utilizing live chat  web collaboration  email and telephone interactions 
we recognize revenues as services are provided  according to the terms of the underlying agreement with our clients which specify how the client will be charged  generally based on a monthly  hourly  per minute or per contact rate 
we also provide licenses to a limited number of our clients for the use of our customer contact software tools that we host 
in these arrangements  we charge our client a monthly fee based on the number of the users 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized as the service is provided 
revenues generated from professional and consulting services are recognized as the service is provided  based on time and materials incurred at contractually agreed upon rates 
credit risk we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter we review the receivables on an account by account basis and determine the probability of collection 
management judgment is exercised in determining the probability of collection 
factors we consider in making this judgment are the age of the receivable  the financial resources of our clients  previous client history and recent client communications 
our credit losses have generally been within our expectations  however  we have experienced exceptions from time to time 
during fiscal  we established a specific reserve of  for a financially distressed client 
during the three months ended september   this customer was able to acquire additional funding and paid us  against their receivable and gave us a note for  that matures in fiscal for the remaining balance 
we have fully reserved the note and will recognize the repayment upon payment from the customer 
there can be no assurance that our future credit losses will be within our expectations 
additionally  our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have an adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
pro forma disclosures currently permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition under sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  the variable accounting treatment of our options that were repriced in april is no longer required 
since the repricing and through september  we were required to record an expense or benefit from marking to market exercisable and outstanding repriced options 
we have recorded a cumulative net expense of  from april through september from marking these options to market 
this cumulative charge is mainly due to net increases in the price of our common stock from the market value per share on the date of the re pricing 
we believe the elimination of the variable accounting treatment of these options under the provisions of sfas r will benefit us in future periods due to the expected continuation of price volatility of our common stock 
therefore  we elected to adopt the provisions of sfas r for the reporting period beginning october  we took steps in september to reduce the cost exposure of implementing sfas r  including accelerating the vesting of all outstanding stock options with exercise prices above the fair market value as of september  under water options 
we used the modified prospective method of adopting the provisions of sfas r 
under this method  the unamortized value of non vested awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r is required to be expensed in our consolidated statement of operations over the remaining vesting period 
by accelerating the vesting of our outstanding underwater options prior to the adoption of sfas r  we were able to reduce the amount of future expense that otherwise would have been required to recognize on these options after adopting sfas r 
options granted after the adoption of sfas r are expensed over their vesting period 
for the periods prior to october   we applied the provisions of sfas sfas encourages entities to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or similar equity instruments 
however  it also allows an entity to continue measuring compensation cost for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb and provide pro forma disclosures required by sfas in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the amount of additional pro forma expense related to these options as presented in our disclosures 
under gaap  had we adopted a fair value based method of accounting for stock options  the pro forma expense for these options would have been recorded as expense in our statements of operations and could have materially affected our operating results 
operations review fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
our revenues increased or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
the primary reason for the increase was  of additional net revenue generated from our existing client base 
the additional net revenue from existing clients in the fiscal year includes a full months of revenue from the clients of the previously mentioned acquired entity whereas the fiscal year included only six months of revenue from clients of the acquired entity 
we were also able to generate  in revenue from new clients 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased  or from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
this increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of increased business as discussed in the revenue section above 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the fiscal year from for the fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit related primarily to revenue growth from clients needing higher margin professional services and cost containment efforts which resulted in personnel cost savings 
this growth was partially offset by our accrual of  of jtip training funds receivable during fiscal the accrual is recognized as an offset to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the jtip program was initiated during fiscal so there are no amounts for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increased marketing efforts resulting in more revenues and growth in personnel and facilities costs related to managing the expanding business 
product development 
our product development costs decreased by  or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to our nearing completion on current product offering initiatives 
specific provision for doubtful account 
in fiscal  we recorded a one time charge of  to increase our bad debt provision for a financially distressed client 
the client incurred difficulties obtaining financing needed to fund an aggressive growth strategy causing us to believe it was likely the client would not be able to pay its obligation 
during the current year this client paid  related to this specific provision for doubtful account and gave us a note for  that matures in fiscal for the remaining balance due 
the amount of this note has been recorded as a note receivable with a full reserve as of march  if repaid by the client during fiscal the full amount of this note will be recognized as an additional offset against the specific provision for doubtful account on our statement of operations 
we also accrue provisions for bad debts during the ordinary course of business when events or circumstances indicate that a receivable may not be collectible 
these provisions offset our receivable balance and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and amortization of intangible assets 
effective october   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of xtrasource 
at that time the fair value of the identified net assets included an allocation of  to intangible assets which primarily represented the acquired customer base  the related assigned contracts and certain future prospects 
the expected life of these intangible assets is estimated to be five years and accordingly  an amortization expense of  and  has been recorded for the years ended march  and  respectively 
restructuring charge 
in january we approved a plan to consolidate our utah contact solution centers into one super center 
we believe that this consolidation will improve our utilization of resources and thereby increase our productivity and profitability 
as part of this plan  we discontinued the use of one of our facilities in march restructuring charges of  and  related to these activities were recorded for the and fiscal years  respectively 
the charges include accrued facilities and relocation costs as well as an impairment of approximately  and  of leasehold improvements that were located in the abandoned facility for the and fiscal years  respectively 
non cash charge for valuation of warrants operating 
we also issued warrants to purchase common stock to a non employee for consulting services 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  we accounted for these arrangements based on the fair value of the warrants issued 
the fair value of these warrants was measured each quarter as the related services were provided and the underlying warrants vested 
we use the black scholes pricing model to determine the value of these warrants 
the resulting quarterly change in value of these warrants was charged to income 
during the and fiscal years  we recorded non cash charges for these warrants of and  respectively 
our arrangement with this consultant was terminated in october stock based compensation 
in april  our board of directors approved an employee stock option exchange program 
under this program  options to purchase  shares of common stock with exercise prices above per share were exchanged for options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the then current market price of 
this exchange program was considered to be an effective repricing of stock options  which requires us to adjust the amount of compensation expense we recognize each quarter until the stock options are exercised  forfeited or expire see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative amount of this charge is calculated by multiplying the exercisable number of options as of the applicable measurement date by the difference between the market price of stock on such date and the exercise price of  less any amounts previously recognized 
during fiscal we recorded a non cash stock based compensation benefit of  a  change from  of non cash stock based compensation expense that we recorded during fiscal this increase was primarily a result of early adoption of sfas no 
r  changes in vested and unexercised options under the exchange program  and fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
r revised sfas no 
and supersedes apb and requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other equity based awards 
interest income 
our interest income increased  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was the increase in interest rates in fiscal interest expense 
our interest expense increased  or  from  during the fiscal year ended march  to  during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense was due primarily to increasing interest rates and the increase in long term debt and capital lease obligations during fiscal non cash charge for valuation of warrants and conversion of debentures 
this expense relates to the amortization of debt discount created by assigning a portion of the proceeds received in conjunction with convertible debentures and notes payable financings to warrants issued with the debt 
we amortize this cost over the life of the corresponding debt 
this cost decreased  or  from  for fiscal to for fiscal the conversion of all of our convertible debt to equity during fiscal required us to accelerate the amortization of this cost and is the primary reason for the decrease in expense over the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
our revenues increased or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
the primary reasons for the increase were  of incremental revenue attributable to our acquisition of xtrasource and  million of additional net revenue generated from our existing client base 
we also generated  in revenue from new clients 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased  or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
this increase in cost was primarily the result of increased business as discussed in the revenue section above 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the fiscal year from for the fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit related primarily to less revenue as a percentage of total revenue being generated from high margin professional services and ramp up costs we incurred due to the increase in business volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  for the fiscal year to  for the fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increased marketing efforts that resulted in more revenues for the fiscal year and additional costs associated with the business we acquired from xtrasource 
product development 
we spent  in product development during fiscal we believe that this product development expenditure was necessary for anticipated new business and to enhance our product offerings 
we incurred no product development costs during fiscal specific provision for doubtful account 
in fiscal  we recorded a one time charge of  to increase our bad debt provision for a financially distressed client 
the client incurred difficulties obtaining financing needed to fund an aggressive growth strategy causing us to believe that it is likely the client will not be able to pay its obligation 
we recorded no such provision during fiscal we accrue provisions for bad debts during the ordinary course of business when events or circumstances indicate that a receivable may not be collectible 
these provisions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and amortization of intangible assets 
effective october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of xtrasource 
we allocated the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired  including an allocation of  to intangible assets which primarily represent the acquired customer base and the related assigned contracts 
we have determined that the expected life of these intangible assets is five years and accordingly  we recorded an expense of  for the amortization of these intangibles during the last six months of fiscal there was no comparable expense during fiscal restructuring charge 
in january we approved a plan to consolidate our utah contact solution centers into one super center 
we believe that this consolidation will improve our utilization of resources and thereby increase our productivity and profitability 
as part of this plan  we stopped using one of our facilities in march and recorded  of related restructuring charges 
the charges include accrued facilities and relocation costs as well as an impairment of approximately  of leasehold improvements that were located in the abandoned facility 
non cash charge for valuation of warrants operating 
we also issued warrants to purchase common stock to a non employee for consulting services 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  we accounted for these arrangements based on the fair value of the warrants issued 
the fair value of these warrants was measured each quarter as the related services were provided and the underlying warrants vested 
we use the black scholes pricing model to determine the value of these warrants 
the resulting quarterly change in value of these warrants was charged to income 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for these warrants of  our arrangement with this consultant was terminated in october we did not incur any similar charges in fiscal stock based compensation 
in april  our board of directors approved an employee stock option exchange program 
under this program  options to purchase  shares of common stock with exercise prices above per share were exchanged for options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the then current market price of 
this exchange program was considered to be an effective repricing of stock options  which requires us to adjust the amount of compensation expense we recognize each quarter until the stock options are exercised  forfeited or expire see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative amount of this charge is calculated by multiplying the exercisable number of options as of the applicable measurement date by the difference between the market price of stock on such date and the exercise price of  less any amounts previously recognized 
during fiscal we recorded a non cash stock based compensation benefit of  a  change from  of non cash stock based compensation expense that we recorded during fiscal this increase was primarily a result of changes in vested and unexercised options under the exchange program and fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
interest income 
our interest income increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was our increase in cash balances resulting primarily from the sale of common stock in march interest expense 
our interest expense decreased  or  from  during the fiscal year ended march  to  during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the conversion of all of our convertible debt into equity during fiscal non cash charge for valuation of warrants and conversion of debentures 
this expense relates to the amortization of debt discount created by assigning a portion of the proceeds received in conjunction with convertible debentures and notes payable financings to warrants issued with the debt 
we amortize this cost over the life of the corresponding debt 
this cost decreased  or  from  for the fiscal to  for fiscal the conversion of all of our convertible debt to equity during fiscal required us to accelerate the amortization of this cost and is the primary reason for the decrease in expense over the prior year 
the  charge in fiscal related exclusively to warrants issued with notes payable financings 
impact of inflation and related matters 
our operations have been impacted in by rising personnel costs 
the increasing personnel costs relate to short supplies of qualified personnel in some of our customer call centers 
we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  of the increased personnel costs to our clients 
it is not possible to predict the future trend of supplies of qualified personnel at reasonable rates  or our ability to pass on future price increases to clients 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during was approximately  compared to  during this decline was primarily attributable to increases in receivables and other assets  which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities 
our working capital decreased  or  from  at march  to  at march  the decrease in cash flow from operating activities caused by the large increase in receivables and other assets is largely due to significant additional revenue achieved late in fiscal which had not been collected  when compared with revenues for the similar period in the net increase in payables and other accrued and current liabilities was also due to this increased business volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to continue our current level of operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we experienced significant growth during the fiscal year 
if this growth continues  we may need to acquire additional debt and or equity financing to provide funding for facilities build outs and working capital requirements 
investing activities 
during the year ended march   of cash was used to purchase property and equipment compared to only  in the prior year 
a significant portion of these capital expenditures were necessary to open the contact solution center in albuquerque  new mexico in october  rather than maintenance of operating capacity 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations  and strategic acquisitions of entities that expand our current operating platform 
acquisitions are an important part of our business strategy and to that end  management routinely reviews potential complementary acquisitions 
it is possible that some portion of future cash and cash equivalents and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt will be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses 
financing activities 
included in our cash flow from financing activities is  of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt which was partially offset by  in principal payments of long term debt and capital leases 
this represents an increase in the current and long term portion of our debt and capital leases of  or  from  at march  to  at march  with the exception of  that was outstanding on our credit line as of march   these borrowings were used to help finance property and equipment purchases 
currently  we have an operating credit line with a bank that allows us to borrow up to  and is based on of eligible accounts receivable 
as of march  and we had  and outstanding on this line of credit  respectively 
the line of credit accrues interest at over the bank s prime rate and at march  and  respectively 
on january   we executed an amendment to loan documents  including an amended and restated schedule to our loan and security agreement 
the amendment was later extended to june  this amendment calls for an additional  term loan with the bank to be used for the purchase of property and equipment 
the loan can be drawn upon in minimum increments of  through june  availability end date 
the loan accrues interest at over the bank s prime rate 
we pay interest only on this loan until the availability end date at which time we will be required to make principal and interest payments 
the principal is to be repaid in equal monthly installments over months from the availability end date 
we also have the option to fix the interest rate to over the yield on united states treasury notes with a three year maturity as of the availability end date 
the foregoing loan agreements call for us to maintain certain liquidity and net worth or debt service and quick ratio covenants 
on june   we amended the loan and security agreement for the period from march  to june  to modify the provisions of related to the liquidity and net worth or debt service and quick ratio covenants 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at march  we also spent  on the acquisition of the xtrasource assets and  on the payment of accrued offering costs during the year ended march  the amount spent on the xtrasource acquisition includes the purchase of xtrasource s secured debt 
options and employee stock purchases in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options  warrants and employee stock purchases totaled  compared to  in option exercise activity is largely dependent on the company s stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  the company receives an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
these tax deductions have not resulted in a reduction to the amount of taxes paid due to the nols and operating losses 
additionally  these deductions do not affect income tax expense or the effective income tax rate  rather they are reflected as increases in capital in excess of par value in the consolidated balance sheets 
summary of future cash requirements significant future cash uses  in addition to operational working capital requirements  are currently expected to consist primarily of debt service payments on outstanding long term debt  and capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements although we have operating leases for facilities and equipment  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of march  payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations under year years years after years total long term debt principal only capital leases operating leases less subleases total contractual cash obligations our long term debt carries interest rates of to 
recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued accounting standards to determine their potential effect  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
based on that review  we do not currently believe any of these recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our current or future financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or disclosures 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock historically has been volatile 
this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price for our common stock has varied between a high of and a low of during the month period ended march  our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other factors discussed in risks relating to our business  variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  and announcement by us of significant acquisitions  or capital commitments 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we become involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  our announcements of our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us  our affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the future  so any short term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance our operations and growth 
the terms and conditions of our long term debt restrict and limit payments or distributions in respect of our capital stock 
seasonality our operating results have historically been affected by the seasonal variances experienced by some of our significant clients 
historically  our third and fourth quarters have been favorably affected by a significant increase in service requests we experienced from our support of certain clients products and or services as compared to the first quarter in which we have historically experienced a significant decrease 
going forward  we anticipate that we will continue to have seasonal variances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes as these risks have not been material to us in the past 
interest expense over the past three fiscal years has been less than one percent of sales 
non guaranteed federal deposits risk 
certain cash and cash equivalents we hold are deposited with financial institutions  and at times such amounts have exceeded insured depository limits 
the company periodically inspects the soundness of the financial institutions with which it does business to manage its risk related to such uninsured deposits 
foreign currency risk 
we face foreign currency risks primarily as a result of the revenues we derive from sales made outside the u 
s  expense incurred outside the us  and from intercompany account balances between our us companies and our non us subsidiaries 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales and of our operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the euro is considered the functional currency in our non us operations  and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the reported periods 
therefore  our foreign sales and expenses will be higher in a period in which there is a weakening of the us dollar and will be lower in a period in which there is a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations and the varying performance of our foreign subsidiaries  we cannot estimate the affect of these fluctuations on our future business  results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could effectively increase or decrease the selling prices of our services in international markets where the prices of our services are denominated in us dollars 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and may take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our operating results 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign currency exchange 
average currency exchange rates to convert one us dollar into each local currency for which we had sales of over  in and were as follows euro
