item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of current market conditions 
each of the markets in which offshore marine services operates is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are pricing and the availability of equipment to fit customer requirements at such time as the equipment is needed 
other important factors include service and reputation  flag preference  local marine operating conditions  the ability to provide and maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and the cost of moving equipment from one geographical location to another 
we operate vessels in six principal geographic regions 
from time to time  vessels are relocated between these regions to meet customer demand for equipment 
the table below sets forth vessel types by geographic market 
we sometimes participate in joint venture arrangements in certain geographical locations in order to enhance our marketing capabilities and facilitate operations in certain foreign markets 
this allows for expansion of both our fleet and operations while diversifying risks and reducing capital outlays associated with such expansion

at december   vessels were operating in the us  including owned  leased in  joint ventured and pooled 
offshore marine services expertise in this market is deepwater anchor handling with our fleet of ahts vessels and exploration and production support with our fleet of crew and mini supply vessels 
this is a highly volatile market because the oil company programs we support tend to be of short term duration and influenced by the near term price of natural gas 
in addition  a large number of offshore marine service companies are active in this market and they compete largely on price alone 
latin america mexico 
at december   vessels were operating in latin america and mexico  including owned and joint ventured 
offshore marine services participated in the mexican market through a joint venture  maritima mexicana  s 
a that market is controlled by the mexican national oil company  petroleos mexicanos pemex  and vessel services are provided either directly to pemex or to its subcontractors 
the level of activity is largely influenced by mexican government policies and finances 
subsequent to december   we sold our interest in maritima mexicana  sa to our partners in that joint venture but continue to charter some of our vessels to them for operation in the mexican market 
we continue to have joint venture vessels operating in chile  argentina  venezuela and brazil 
north sea 
at december   vessels were operating in the north sea  including owned  joint ventured  and managed in 
the north sea fleet primarily provides standby safety services 
demand in the north sea market for standby services developed in after the united kingdom promulgated legislation requiring offshore operations to maintain higher specification standby safety vessels 
the legislation requires a vessel to stand by to provide a means of evacuation and rescue for platform and rig personnel in the event of an emergency at an offshore installation 
the north sea is a highly regulated market 
west africa 
at december   vessels were operating in west africa  including owned  and bareboat chartered in 
our largest market in this area is nigeria  where we work in cooperation with a nigerian company  west africa offshore 
the nigerian market is dominated primarily by the major oil companies and is characterized by large scale  multi year projects 
there is also a significant political component behind investment decisions as the nigerian national oil company  nnpc  is a participant in almost all offshore development 
the remainder of the company s vessels in this region operate from ports in angola  the republic of the congo  cameroon  gabon  equatorial guinea and south africa 
asia 
at december   vessels were operating in asia  including owned  leased in  joint ventured and managed 
offshore marine services vessels operating in this area generally support exploration programs and therefore follow the rigs to their locations in the region 
to date  the largest market in this area has been indonesia 
in the last few years  we have invested in vessels capable of specialty operations such as supporting the operation of remote operated vehicles  telecommunications cable laying repair and offshore accommodation 
we compete against a large number of local and international companies in this market 
middle east 
at december   vessels were operating in the middle east region  including owned and joint ventured 
offshore marine services vessels operating in this area generally support countries along the arabian gulf and arabian sea  including the united arab emirates  qatar  pakistan and india 
we compete against a large number of local and international companies in this market 
competitive conditions although there are many suppliers of offshore marine services  management believes only one other company  tidewater  inc  operates in all of offshore marine services major geographic markets 
tidewater  inc has a substantially greater percentage of the offshore marine market compared to that of offshore marine services and its other competitors 
customers and contractual arrangements offshore marine services principal customers are major integrated oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and emerging independent companies 
consolidation of oil and gas companies through mergers and acquisitions over the past several years has further and generally limited offshore marine services customer base 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of offshore marine services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on offshore marine services results of operations 
the offshore marine services segment earns and recognizes revenues primarily from the time charter and bareboat charter of vessels to customers based upon daily rates of hire 
a time charter is a lease arrangement under which the company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses  normally excluding fuel 
under bareboat charter agreements  the company provides the vessel to the customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and assumes all risk of operation 
vessel charters may range from several days to several years 
revenues from time charter and bareboat charter are recorded as service is provided 
typically charter durations and rates are established in the context of master service agreements which govern the terms and conditions of hire 
risks of foreign operations for the years ended december   and approximately   and  respectively  of offshore marine services operating revenues were derived from foreign operations 
foreign operations are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include  among others  political instability  asset seizures  nationalization of assets  terrorist attacks  fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  controls on currency exchange  the repatriation of income or capital  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these conditions or events might develop in the future 
the occurrence of any one or more of such conditions or events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
marine transportation services business the marine transportation services operates a fleet of us flag tankers  nine of which are owned and one which is bareboat chartered 
two foreign flag tankers acquired in the seabulk merger were sold in august and september our tankers provide marine transportation services for petroleum products  petrochemicals and chemicals moving in the us domestic or coastwise trade 
the merchant marine act of  commonly referred to as the jones act  requires that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us marine transportation services accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the six month period in following the seabulk merger 
equipment and services the oil pollution act of opa established that vessels that do not have double hulls will be prohibited from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after a certain date based on the age and size of the vessel unless they are modified with a double hull 
in addition  such vessels will be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most foreign and international markets under a more accelerated phase out schedule established by the international maritime organization imo 
the table below sets forth our marine transportation services fleet as at december  name of vessel capacity in barrels tonnage in dwt opa retirement date type seabulk trader double bottom seabulk challenge double bottom hmi brenton reef none double hull seabulk energy none double hull seabulk arctic none double hull seabulk mariner none double hull seabulk pride none double hull seabulk power single hull seabulk magnachem double bottom seabulk america double bottom dead weight tons or dwt 
we operate the seabulk magnachem under a bareboat charter expiring in february at which time we have an option to purchase the vessel 
markets petroleum product transportation 
in the domestic energy trade  oceangoing vessels transport fuel and other petroleum products primarily from refineries and storage facilities along the coast of the us gulf of mexico to utilities  waterfront industrial facilities and distribution facilities along the us gulf of mexico  the atlantic and pacific coasts  as well as transport crude and product between alaska and the west coast and hawaii 
the number of us flag oceangoing vessels eligible to participate in the us domestic trade and capable of transporting fuel or petroleum products has steadily decreased since as vessels have reached the end of their useful lives or are being retired due to opa requirements 
in addition  the cost of new vessel construction in the united states a requirement to operate in the us domestic coastwise trade has substantially increased 
chemical transportation 
in the us domestic coastwise chemical transportation trade  vessels carry chemicals  primarily from chemical manufacturing plants and storage tank facilities along the coast of the us gulf of mexico to industrial users in and around us atlantic and pacific coast ports 
the chemicals transported consist primarily of caustic soda  paraxylene  alkylates  toluene and lubricating oils 
some of the chemicals must be carried in vessels with specially coated or stainless steel cargo tanks and many of them are sensitive to contamination and require special cargo handling equipment 
customers and contractual arrangements the primary purchasers of petroleum product transportation services are multi national oil and gas companies  oil trading companies and large industrial consumers of fuel with waterfront facilities 
the primary purchasers of chemical transportation services are chemical and oil companies 
both services are generally contracted for on the basis of short term or long term time charters  voyage charters  contracts of affreightment or other transportation agreements tailored to the shipper s requirements 
even though there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of marine transportation services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on marine transportation services result of operations 
for vessels not operating under time charters or voyage charters  the company books cargoes either on a spot movement by movement or contract of affreightment basis 
as with other vessels we operate  tankers operated by marine transportation services under time charter are operated for a daily rate of hire where the customer pays for fuel and we are responsible for the actual operation of the vessel and all other vessel operating expenses 
when we bareboat charter a tanker to a customer  the customer pays us a daily rate of hire but also assumes all risk of operation and pays all operating expenses 
contracts of affreightment are contracts with a customer for the carriage of cargoes that are committed on a multi voyage basis over a period of weeks or months  with minimum and maximum cargo tonnages specified over the period at fixed or escalating rates per ton depending on the duration of the contract 
typically  under voyage charters and contracts of affreightment the vessel owner pays for the fuel and any applicable port charges 
competition the markets in which our tanker vessels operate are highly competitive 
our primary direct competitors are other operators of us flag ocean going tank vessels and chemical carriers 
the most important competitive factors are pricing and availability to fit customer requirements as well as the requirement in certain areas to operate double hull or double bottom vessels 
inland river services business inland river services  which trades under the name scf marine inc scf  is primarily engaged in the operation of a fleet of dry cargo barges which carry bulk goods on the mississippi  illinois  tennessee and ohio rivers and their tributaries and the gulf intracoastal waterways 
principal cargoes include ore  grain  coal  aggregate  steel  scrap and fertilizers 
as of december   inland river services operated a fleet of  dry cargo barges  of which are owned  chartered in  managed on behalf of third parties and six owned through a joint venture 
certain of inland river services barging activities are supported by four wholly owned towboats and three towboats in which inland river services holds a majority interest 
all of our towboats are operated by third parties 
inland river services also owns chemical and product tank barges that are operated by a third party 
these transport liquid bulk cargoes such as lube oils  solvents and glycols 
in we expanded our services through the purchase of a fleeting operation which is a staging area for grouping barges in preparation for movements up and down the river and a holding area for barges waiting to load and unload cargo 
the fleeting operation is managed by a third party 
inland river services contributed  and of consolidated operating revenues in  and  respectively 
equipment and services we operate of our dry cargo barges with barges owned by third parties through a pooling arrangement that we manage 
under this arrangement  operating revenues and expenses of the entire pool are shared among the barge owners on the basis of barge days contributed 
each barge owner is responsible for the costs of insurance  maintenance and repair as well as for capital and financing costs of its own equipment in the pool 
scf s fleet of dry cargo barges consists of open and covered hopper barges 
open hopper barges are used to transport commodities that are not sensitive to water such as coal  aggregate and scrap 
covered hopper barges are more versatile because they can also carry water sensitive products  such as grain  ores  alloys  cements and fertilizer 
each dry cargo barge in our fleet is capable of transporting approximately  to  tons  to  metric tons of cargo 
the carrying capacity of a barge at any particular time is determined by water depth in the river channels and hull size of the barge 
inland barges are unmanned and are moved on the us inland waterways by vessels known in the trade as towboats 
the combination of a towboat and dry cargo barges is commonly referred to as a tow 
tows usually range in size from fifteen to forty barges 
the number of dry cargo barges included in a tow depends on a variety of factors  including the horsepower of the towboat  river width and navigational conditions  the direction of travel and the mix of loaded and empty barges in the tow 
inland river services contracts with third parties to move its dry cargo barges on a spot basis  meaning that the rates it pays for barge movements are market driven 
towing prices fluctuate with demand  rising with higher volumes and higher fuel costs 
scf has ownership interests in seven towboats that are operated by a third party 
typical dry cargo voyage activity requires shifting a clean  empty barge from a fleeting location to a loading facility 
the barge is then moved from the loading location and assembled into a tow before proceeding to its next destination 
after unloading it is shifted to a fleeting area for cleaning and repair if needed before being moved again into a load position 
generally  the company tries to match up northbound and southbound movements of cargo to minimize the movements of empty barges 
typically  grain cargos move southbound and non grain cargos move northbound 
the following table sets forth the number of dry cargo barges  chemical tank barges and towboats owned and or operated by inland river services 
at december  fleet structure dry cargo barges owned open covered total owned managed chartered in joint ventured total fleet chemical tank barges towboats owned by the company 
three  horsepower towboats were acquired in december and are bareboat chartered out 
the company and a minority partner jointly own three  horsepower towboats which were acquired in july a  horsepower towboat was acquired in and is bareboat chartered out 
markets dry cargo barges provide cost effective transport for many bulk commodity shippers 
primary users of dry cargo barges include major us agricultural and industrial companies 
dry cargo commodities transported on the us inland waterways include coal  petroleum byproducts  grain and grain byproducts  fertilizers  both raw steel commodities and finished steel  nonferrous minerals and construction materials 
grains rank as the primary export  coal and petroleum products are predominately moved domestically  and fertilizer  steel  and construction materials are both imported and moved domestically within the us inland waterways 
the market for our services  prices achieved and utilization are driven by supply demand economics 
the relationship between supply and demand reflects many factors including the level of domestic and international production of the basic agricultural products to be transported in particular the yields from grain harvests the level of domestic and international consumption of agricultural products and the effect of these levels on the volumes of products that are physically moved into the export markets worldwide demand for iron ore  steel  steel by products  coal  petroleum and other bulk commodities strength or weakness of the us dollar volatility of foreign economies volume of grain production in different growing regions the cost of ocean freight and the cost of fuel within the us other local factors also have an effect on pricing including the supply of barges available to move the products the ability to position the barges to maximize efficiencies and utility in moving cargoes both northbound and southbound the cost of alternative forms of transportation primarily rail general operating logistics on the river network including operating status of locks the effect of river levels on the loading capacities of the barges in terms of draft restrictions most of inland river services business is booked in the short term and spot markets  and therefore  its earnings are subject to fluctuations in market rates 
we occasionally seek to enter into long term contracts to provide a level of stable cash flows and moderate the effect of market fluctuations 
seasonality the upper mississippi river usually closes to barge traffic from mid december to mid march 
ice hinders the navigation of barge traffic on the mid mississippi river  the illinois river and the upper ohio river during the same period 
adverse river conditions due to high water resulting from excessive rainfall  or low water caused by drought  can also impact operations by limiting the speed at which tows travel the us inland waterways  the number of barges included in tows  and the quantity of cargo that is loaded in the barges 
the volume of grain transported from the midwest to the gulf of mexico  which is primarily for export  is highest during the harvest season from mid august through late november 
the harvest season is particularly significant because pricing tends to peak during these months in response to higher demand for equipment 
competitive conditions we believe that there are four other major domestic companies that operate over  barges each  with three of those operating over  barges each 
there are also four mid sized barge companies that operate more than but less than  barges 
the company estimates that the ten largest operators control approximately of the dry cargo capacity and the twelve largest operators control of the liquid cargo capacity in the barge industry 
competition is based primarily on price and equipment availability 
while our main competitors are other barge lines  railroads also compete for traffic that might otherwise move on the water 
customers and contractual arrangements the principal customers for inland river services are major agricultural and industrial companies 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of inland river services revenues in the loss of one or a few of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on inland river services results of operations 
most of the barges in the fleet are employed under contracts of affreightment a contract of affreightment is an agreement to transport cargo from one point to another for a specified rate per ton with customers 
contracts of affreightment can vary in duration  ranging from one voyage to several years 
for longer term contracts base rates may be adjusted in response to changes in fuel prices and operating expenses 
some longer term contracts provide for the transport of a minimum number of tons of cargo or the transportation requirements for a particular customer 
some of the barges are bareboat chartered out to third parties for a fixed payment of hire per day for the duration of the charter 
these contracts tend to be longer  ranging in term from one to five years 
aviation services business aviation services commenced operations in december with the acquisition of houston based helicopter owner operator tex air helicopters  inc tex air an operator of helicopters primarily servicing the offshore oil and gas markets in texas and louisiana 
on december   we acquired era aviation  inc the era acquisition  which operated helicopters  an airline with sixteen fixed wing aircraft  which we sold on july   and a fixed base operation fbo providing fuel and services to third parties at anchorage international airport 
in april  we integrated the operations of tex air with those of era aviation  inc and we began operating the combined group as era helicopters llc era 
era s primary activities support offshore oil and gas activities in the us gulf of mexico and alaska  flightseeing in alaska and equipment leasing in various parts of the world 
we operate from bases in alabama  louisiana  mississippi  texas and alaska 
aviation services contributed  and of consolidated operating revenues in  and  respectively 
equipment and services at december   aviation services owned helicopters and leased others under operating leases 
of these  were located in the united states and were located in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to our operating fleet of helicopters  helicopters have been removed from service and are being marketed for sale 
aviation services operates a federal aviation administration faa approved maintenance repair station in lake charles  louisiana and is a factory approved service facility for bell helicopter  american eurocopter and turbomeca 
since  era has manufactured and marketed  from its lake charles facility a composite external auxiliary fuel tank for use on several helicopter types  including the bell  and the military huey 
the tank system provides enhanced flight range with nominal drag while increasing passenger capacity 
sales to date have been to both civilian and military customers 
other aircraft accessories are also manufactured at the facility 
the composition of aviation services fleet as of december  was as follows manufacturer model number engine passenger capacity light helicopters eurocopter ec single eurocopter as types single agusta a single eurocopter bo twin agusta a twin medium helicopters sikorsky s types twin eurocopter ec twin bell bell twin agusta ab twin heavy helicopters sikorsky s twin the flightseeing tourist services in alaska are provided through contractual arrangement with cruise lines and through direct bookings with hotels  travel agents and individual passengers 
these services are operated out of juneau and from areas near denali national park 
other helicopter services to the oil and mining industries in alaska are provided on a contract or charter basis from bases in valdez  anchorage  the kenai area and deadhorse 
these services are somewhat seasonal in nature  peaking during the months of may through september when weather conditions are more conducive to operations 
operations in the us gulf of mexico largely support the offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production industry 
services are provided from aviation services corporate office in lake charles  louisiana and from bases in the louisiana cities of morgan city  cameron  abbeville  venice  fourchon  houma  schriever and johnson s bayou  the texas cities of galveston and sabine pass  from pascagoula mississippi and from theodore  alabama 
our principal aircraft base in alaska is our fixed base operation and hangar space at ted stevens anchorage international airport 
we also maintain smaller helicopter facilities in alaska at deadhorse and valdez and we own properties in juneau and denali park  alaska 
markets at this time  aviation services principal market for its transportation services is the oil and gas industry with offshore operations in the us gulf of mexico 
the customers and locations are similar to those serviced by offshore marine services and the market and aviation services opportunities there are subject to the same cycles and pressures as described above 
see item business offshore marine services markets 
in addition  aviation services leases aircraft in the us and internationally  conducts flightseeing operations in alaska and provides services to the utility and offshore markets in alaska 
seasonality a significant portion of aviation services operating revenues and profits from serving oil and gas industry customers is dependent on actual flight hours 
the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight and consequently flight hours are generally lower at these times 
in addition  prolonged periods of adverse weather and the effect of fewer hours of daylight can adversely impact our operating results 
in general  the winter months of december through february in the us gulf of mexico and october through april in alaska have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year 
in the us gulf of mexico  june through november is tropical storm season 
during tropical storms  we are unable to operate in the area of the storm although flight activity may increase immediately prior to and after storms due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers 
our flightseeing operation is also seasonal  activity generally occurs from late may until early september 
competitive conditions the helicopter transportation business is highly competitive 
there are two major competitors in the us phi  inc and bristow group inc 
as well as several other smaller companies 
in addition  several customers in the us gulf of mexico operate their own helicopter fleets 
we are the third largest helicopter company operating in the us gulf of mexico and one of the largest operators of flightseeing helicopters in alaska 
in most instances  an operator must have an acceptable safety record  demonstrated reliability and suitable equipment to participate in bidding for work 
among bidders meeting these criteria  customers typically make their final choice based on price and aircraft preference 
customers and contractual arrangements aviation services charters its helicopters to utility and oil and gas customers primarily through master service agreements  term contracts and day to day charter arrangements 
master service agreements require incremental payments above a fixed fee based upon flight hours flown  have fixed terms ranging from one month to five years and generally are cancelable upon days notice 
term contracts and day to day charter arrangements are generally non cancelable without cause and call for a combination of a monthly or daily fixed rental fee plus a charge based on hours flown 
day to day charter arrangements are generally based on either an hourly or daily rate 
our rate structure  as it applies to our utility and oil and gas contracts  contains terms that limit our exposure to increases in fuel costs over a pre agreed level 
fuel costs in excess of these levels are passed through to our customers 
with respect to flightseeing aircraft  we allocate block space to cruise lines and sell seats directly to customers 
at december   we had helicopters operating under master service agreements or term contracts with customers 
the company s principal customers in the us gulf of mexico are oil companies of varying sizes and production management companies 
in alaska  the company s principal customers are oil companies and cruise line passengers 
there are other markets for our helicopter transportation services that include oil and gas industry support activities abroad  medical transportation  agricultural support and general aviation activities 
our activity in these markets is limited 
we have nine helicopters operating abroad under leases to third parties 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of aviation services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on aviation services results of operations 
environmental services business environmental services primarily provides emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the us and abroad 
in the united states  these services are generally related to those clients who store  transport  produce or handle petroleum and certain non petroleum oils as required by opa and various other federal  state and municipal regulations 
internationally  these services may be required by legislation and regulation of the countries where our clients operate  international maritime conventions and environmental covenants placed on clients by their lending institutions 
in general  emergency preparedness services may include development of response plans  training  exercises  equipment selection and sales and other consulting projects 
response services may include mitigation and supervision of actual emergency response and crisis management situations  such as industrial fires  hazardous materials releases and oil spills 
we also bid on and perform contractual services for federal  state and local governments from time to time 
we conduct our business through the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  national response corporation nrc  the o brien s group  inc  seacor environmental services international ltd 
sesi and nrc environmental services inc nrces which was acquired in november this segment contributed  and of consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
products and services emergency response services 
environmental services employs trained personnel and maintains specialized equipment positioned in the us and in certain locations outside the us to respond to oil spills  other emergencies and projects required by our customers 
a fleet of specialized vessels and barges outfitted with oil spill equipment is positioned on the east  gulf  and west coasts of the us as well as in the caribbean and hawaii 
oil spill and other response equipment is also stationed in certain international locations  such as the caspian region  far east  middle east and south america 
the division has also established a network of approximately independent oil spill response contractors that may assist it by providing equipment and personnel 
operating revenues earned from emergency response services approximated  and of environmental services total operating revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
retainer services 
we offer retainer contracts to the maritime community  such as operators of tank and non tank vessels and chemical carriers and to owners of facilities  such as refineries  pipelines  exploration and production platforms  power plants and storage tank and transportation terminals 
retainer services include access to professional response management and specialized equipment necessary to respond to an oil or chemical spill emergency 
consulting services 
our personnel assist clients in the development and updating of their prevention  emergency response and security plans 
these personnel also develop and conduct customized training programs for clients to educate their employees on the prevention of and response to emergencies  such as oil spills  handling of hazardous materials releases  fire fighting  security incidents and other crisis related events and associated risks 
in addition  our environmental professionals plan  conduct  evaluate and participate in customer and government led emergency response drills and exercises 
we also assist customers in the selection  purchase  shipment and commissioning of environmental equipment and products and training of personnel to operate this equipment 
consultants with specialized qualifications also conduct and assist with vessel inspections and security assessments of vessels and facilities 
we offer these services throughout the us and internationally  both on a stand alone basis and as part of retainer services  to our oil  chemical  industrial  marine transportation and government customers 
industrial and remediation services 
we also provide remediation and cleaning services to oil  chemical  industrial and government clients primarily on the us west coast 
these services include hazardous waste management  industrial and marine cleaning services  salvage support  petroleum storage tank removal and site remediation services 
some of these projects are required or governed by federal  state or local regulations 
also  many of these projects are the result of competitive bidding conducted by our customers 
markets the market for contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services in the us resulted from the enactment of the opa legislation passed by the us congress after the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska 
opa requires that all tank vessels operating within the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states and all facilities and pipelines handling oil that could have a spill affecting the navigable waters of the us develop a plan to respond to a worst case oil spill and ensure by contract or other approved means the ability to respond to such a spill 
certain states have enacted similar oil spill laws and regulations  most notably california  washington and alaska 
in  many of these same preparedness and response requirements were expanded to include self propelled non tank vessels greater than gross tons by passage of the coast guard and maritime transportation act of the us coast guard has in turn issued a navigation and vessel inspection circular to clarify these requirements and is in the process of promulgating final regulations 
the united nations marpol convention also subjects companies to various requirements governing waste disposal and water and air pollution 
we also provide vessel security assessments  security plans  security training and exercises and other related services 
we market these services to clients who are required to comply with the maritime transportation security act of which was enacted following the september  terrorist attacks 
we also market these services to federal  state  county and local agencies to assist them in their efforts to improve emergency preparedness and response capabilities 
the international market is characterized by two distinct operating environments developed and developing nations 
in developed nations  the environmental regulations generally are mature and governments usually respond to oil spills with public resources and then recover their costs from the responsible parties 
in developing nations where global oil exploration and production exists  there is less oil spill response infrastructure and environmental services is seeking to develop opportunities to work with international oil and gas exploration and producing companies in such nations 
customers and contractual arrangements environmental services offers its services primarily to the domestic and international shipping community  major oil companies  independent exploration and production companies  power generating operators  industrial companies and airports 
services are provided pursuant to contracts generally ranging from one month to ten years 
in addition to our retainer customers  we provide training  exercise and response services for oil spills  chemical releases  terrorist acts and natural disasters to others  including  under certain circumstances  local  state and federal agencies such as the us coast guard 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of environmental services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on environmental services results of operations 
environmental services has more than  customers  and management does not believe that it is dependent on a single customer or small group of customers 
competitive conditions the principal competitive factors in the environmental service business are price  customer service  reputation  experience and operating capabilities 
in the us  nrc faces competition primarily from the marine spill response corporation  a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other non profit industry cooperatives and also from those commercial contractors who target specific market niches in response  consulting and remediation 
internationally  competition for both oil spill response and emergency preparedness and management comes from a few well known private companies and regional oil industry cooperatives 
risks of foreign operations environmental services operates worldwide 
services include oil spill response  training  exercise support and special projects in assessing risk of spills  response preparedness  strategies and resource requirements to multinational oil companies  governments and industry 
for the years ended december   and approximately   and  respectively  of environmental services operating revenues were derived from its foreign operations 
a significant increase in operating revenues earned from foreign operations in resulted from spill response  spill management  containment and remediation services provided in support of operation iraqi freedom 
foreign operations are subject to various inherent risks 
these risks include  among others  political instability  nationalization of assets  terrorist attacks  the repatriation of income or capital  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these conditions or events might develop in the future 
other harbor and offshore towing services 
the harbor and offshore towing services operation was acquired on july  as a result of the seabulk merger 
at december   the company operated a total of tugs  of which were conventional tugs and eleven were tractor tugs 
of the tractor tugs  four were ship docking module sdms which are innovative ship docking vessels  designed and patented by seabulk 
they are maneuverable  efficient and flexible and require fewer crew members than conventional harbor tugs 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of harbor and offshore towing services operating revenues 
at december   twelve tugs were operating in florida  four in port everglades  six in tampa and two in port canaveral 
there were five tugs operating in port arthur  texas  three in mobile  alabama and three in lake charles  louisiana

our domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the us coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the us customs service and the us maritime administration  as well as to rules of private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these agencies and organizations establish safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved maritime safety standards 
aviation services is subject to regulations pursuant to the federal aviation act of  as amended the federal aviation act  and other statutes pursuant to federal aviation regulations part air taxi certificate granted by the federal aviation administration the faa 
the faa regulates flight operations and  in this respect  has jurisdiction over aviation services personnel  aircraft  ground facilities and certain technical aspects of its operations 
in addition to the faa  the national transportation safety board is authorized to investigate aircraft accidents and to recommend improved safety standards and  because of the use of radio facilities in its operations  we are also subject to the communications act of  as amended 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and inland river services are also subject to the shipping act   as amended the act  and the merchant marine act of  as amended the act  or the jones act and  together with the act  the shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between us ports known as us coastwise trade 
the shipping acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us for a corporation engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a us citizen i the corporation must be organized under the laws of the us or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii each of the president or other chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a us citizen  iii no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens and iv at least of the interest in such corporation must be owned by us citizens as defined in the shipping acts 
should the company fail to comply with the us citizenship requirements of the shipping acts  it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in the us coastwise trade during the period of such non compliance 
aviation services helicopters operating in the united states are similarly subject to registration and citizenship requirements under the federal aviation act 
that act requires that before an aircraft may be legally operated in the united states  it must be owned by citizens of the united states  which  in the case of a corporation  means a corporation i organized under the laws of the us or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii of which at least of its voting interests are owned or controlled by persons who are us citizens as defined in the federal aviation act and regulations promulgated thereunder  and iii of which the president and at least two thirds of the board of directors and managing officers are us citizens 
to facilitate compliance with the shipping acts  seacor s restated certificate of incorporation i limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non us citizens of any class of the seacor s capital stock including the common stock to of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such foreign ownership will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law presently but authorizes seacor s board of directors  under certain circumstances  to increase the foregoing percentage to  ii requires institution of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership and iii permits the board of directors to make such determinations as reasonably may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations 
in addition  seacor s by laws provide that the number of foreign directors shall not exceed a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and restrict any officer who is not a us citizen from acting in the absence or disability of the chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer and the president  all of whom must be us citizens 
all of marine transportation services and inland river services vessels and the majority of offshore marine services vessels are registered in the united states and operate in the us coastwise trade 
offshore marine services also operates vessels registered in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
vessels registered in these jurisdictions are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership  registration  manning and safety 
in addition  the vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration 
among the more significant of these conventions are i the protocol relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships  ii the international convention on the safety of life at sea  and protocols  and iii the international convention on standards of training  certification and watchkeeping for seafarers  the company believes that its vessels registered in foreign jurisdictions are in compliance with all applicable material regulations and have all licenses necessary to conduct their business 
in addition  vessels operated as standby safety vessels in the north sea are subject to the requirements of the department of transport of the united kingdom pursuant to the united kingdom safety act 
all of our chemical and petroleum product tankers  harbor and offshore towing vessels  certain of our offshore marine vessels and all of our inland river tank barges that are operated by a third party are subject to periodic inspection and survey by  and drydocking and maintenance requirements of  the us coast guard and or the american bureau of shipping and other marine classification societies 
moreover  to insure compliance with applicable safety regulations  the us coast guard is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
nrc  one of our environmental services companies  is classified by the us coast guard as an oil spill removal organization osro for every port in the continental us  hawaii and the caribbean 
the osro classification process is strictly voluntary 
vessel owners and other customers subject to opa who utilize classified osros are exempt from the requirement to list their response resources in their plans 
the classification process permits the us coast guard and these customers to evaluate an osro s ability to respond to and recover oil spills of various types and sizes in different operating environments and geographic locations 
in addition to the us coast guard  the us environmental protection agency epa  the office of pipeline safety  the minerals management service division of the us department of interior and certain individual states regulate vessels  facilities and pipelines in accordance with the requirements of opa or under analogous state law 
there is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies 
when responding to third party oil spills  environmental services enjoys immunity from liability under federal law and some state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts  except in the event of deaths or personal injuries as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct 
environmental compliance as more fully described below  all of our businesses are  to some degree  subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health  including laws that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties and fines  injunctions or other sanctions 
we believe that our operations currently are in compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations 
we do not expect that we will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to our financial condition or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations  however  because such laws and regulations are frequently changing and may impose increasingly strict requirements  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards  and it is our view that this trend is likely to continue 
the oil pollution act of opa opa establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills 
opa applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters and owners and operators of vessels operating in us waters  which include the navigable waters of the united states and the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states 
although it appears to apply in general to all vessels  for purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements  opa differentiates between tank vessels which include our chemical and petroleum product vessels and other vessels which include our tugs  offshore marine vessels and dry cargo barges 
under opa  owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or certain charterers of vessels are responsible parties and are jointly  severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of certain third parties under specified circumstances  an act of god or an act of war 
damages are defined broadly to include i injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof  ii injury to  or economic losses resulting from the destruction of  real and personal property  iii net loss by the us government  a state or political subdivision thereof of taxes  royalties  rents  fees and profits  iv lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage  v net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response  such as protection from fire  safety or other hazards  and vi loss of subsistence use of available natural resources 
the statutory liability of responsible parties for tank vessels is limited to the greater of  per gross ton or million million for a vessel of  gross tons or less per vessel  for any other vessel  such liability is limited to the greater of per gross ton or  per vessel 
these liability limits do not apply a if an incident is caused by the responsible party s violation of federal safety  construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  b if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or c if the responsible party fails to comply with certain governmental orders 
under opa  with certain limited exceptions  all newly built or converted oil tankers carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us waters must be built with double hulls 
existing single hull  double side or double bottom tank vessels  unless retrofitted with double hulls  must be phased out of service at some point through  depending upon the vessel s size  age and place of discharge 
as a result of this phase out requirement  as interpreted by the us coast guard  unless modified to install double hulls  our one single hull and four double bottom chemical and petroleum product tankers will be required to cease transporting petroleum products between and opa expanded pre existing financial responsibility requirements and requires tank vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain with the us coast guard evidence of insurance or qualification as a self insurer or other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under opa we have satisfied us coast guard regulations by providing evidence of financial responsibility demonstrated by commercial insurance and self insurance 
the regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  described below  which imposes liability for discharges of hazardous substances such as chemicals  in an amount equal to per gross ton  thus increasing the overall financial responsibility in the case of tank vessels from  to  per gross ton 
opa also amended the clean water act  also described below  to require the owner or operator of certain facilities or of a tank vessel to prepare facility or vessel response plans and to contract with oil spill removal organizations to remove to the maximum extent practicable a worst case discharge 
the company has complied with these requirements 
we expect our pollution liability insurance to cover any cost of spill removal subject to overall coverage limitations of billion  however  a failure or refusal of the insurance carrier to provide coverage in the event of a catastrophic spill could result in material liability in excess of available insurance coverage  resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
opa allows states to impose their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries  and many states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills 
some states have issued regulations addressing financial responsibility and vessel and facility response planning requirements 
we do not anticipate that state legislation or regulations will have any material impact on our operations 
in addition to opa  the following are examples of environmental laws that relate to our business and operations the clean water act cwa 
the federal cwa and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the united states 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
a related statute  the coastal zone management act  authorizes state development and implementation of programs to manage non point source pollution to restore and protect coastal waters 
the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the federal rcra and comparable state and local laws regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and certain non hazardous wastes 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
our operations may generate or  in some cases  result in the transportation of these regulated wastes 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
the federal cercla and comparable state laws establish strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liabilities for specified parties in connection with liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and damages to natural resources 
the clean air act caa 
the federal caa and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
our chemical and petroleum product carrier vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements when loading  unloading  ballasting  cleaning  and conducting other operations in certain ports and are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements in all material respects 
we manage exposure to losses from the above described laws through our efforts to use only well maintained  well managed and equipped facilities and vessels and our development of safety and environmental programs  including a maritime compliance program and our insurance program 
we believe we will be able to accommodate reasonably foreseeable environmental regulatory changes 
there can be no assurance  however  that any future regulations or requirements or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by us will not have a material adverse effect 
security heightened awareness of security needs brought about by the events of september  has caused the us coast guard  the international maritime organization and the states and local ports to adopt heightened security procedures relating to ports and vessels 
the company has updated its procedures in light of the new requirements 
in  congress passed the maritime transportation security act the mtsa  which together with the international maritime organization s recent security proposals collectively known as the international ship and port facility security code or isps  requires specific security plans for our vessels and rigorous crew identification requirements 
the following vessels are subject to the requirements of the isps us flag vessels operating in the jones act trade that are at least gross registered tons us flag vessels operating on an international voyage foreign flag vessels that are at least gross tons under the itc international tonnage convention the company has implemented vessel security plans and procedures for each of its us flag vessels pursuant to rules implementing the mtsa which have been issued by the us coast guard 
the company anticipates that the costs of security for our business will continue to increase 
in addition  the company s us flag vessels  subject to the requirements of the isps  all foreign flag vessels and us flag vessels  operating on an international voyage  were in compliance with the isps requirements effective july  industry hazards and insurance vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment 
in addition  helicopter operations are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents 
hazards include adverse weather conditions  collisions  fire and mechanical failures  which may result in injury to personnel  damage to equipment  loss of operating revenues  contamination of cargo  pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs 
the company maintains marine and aviation hull  liability and war risk  general liability  workers compensation and other insurance customary in the industries in which we operate 
we also conduct training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately  individuals directly and indirectly through crewing or manning agreements 
substantially all indirect employees support offshore marine services vessel operations 
at december  offshore marine services employed seafarers in the united kingdom of whom were members of a union under the terms of an ongoing agreement 
in the united states  a total of approximately employees are unionized in marine transportation services and towing harbor services 
the union agreements expire at varying times from august  to may  certain individuals in environmental services are also represented by unions 
the unionization of domestic seamen and or aviation employees could arise in the future 
management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory 
item a 
risk factors risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results demand for many of our services substantially depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production industry 
the level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile and that volatility is likely to continue 
the level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond our control  including prevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore worldwide demand for energy and other petroleum products as well as chemical products availability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas local and international political and economic conditions and policies including cabotage and local content laws technological advances affecting energy production and consumption weather conditions environmental regulation the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital a prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices is likely to cause a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration  development and production activity 
lower levels of expenditure and activity would result in a decline in the demand and lower rates for our offshore energy support services and tanker services 
moreover  approximately of our offshore marine services and of our aviation services are currently conducted in the us gulf of mexico and are therefore dependent on levels of activity in that region  which may differ from levels of activity in other regions of the world 
we conduct international operations  which involve additional risks 
we operate vessels and lease helicopters worldwide 
activity outside the us involves additional risks  including the possibility of restrictive actions by foreign governments  including asset seizure foreign taxation and changes in foreign tax laws limitations on repatriation of earnings changes in currency exchange rates local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements nationalization and expropriation loss of contract rights political instability  war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets our ability to compete in the international offshore energy support market may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
further  our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company 
unstable political  military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of offshore marine services operations are conducted could adversely impact our business 
during  approximately of our offshore marine services operating revenues principally resulted from offshore marine services foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  including potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation  all of which are beyond our control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example could have significant impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and correspondingly on us should offshore marine services operate vessels in a country subject to any sanctions or embargo  or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupt our operations in the region 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services rely on several customers for a significant share of their revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services businesses and operating results 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services customers are primarily major oil companies and large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the portion of offshore marine services  marine transportation services or aviation services revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by such customer  our ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
consolidation of our customer base could adversely affect demand for our equipment and reduce our revenues 
oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation in the last few years 
additional consolidation is likely 
consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our equipment 
also  merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration  development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed 
such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation  adversely affecting demand for our offshore marine services vessels  marine transportation services tankers and aviation services helicopters  thereby reducing our revenues 
we may be unable to maintain or replace our vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of our offshore marine services vessels  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
an increase in the supply of offshore support vessels or tankers would likely have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by our offshore support vessels and tankers 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where offshore marine services operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates 
similarly  should our competitors in the domestic petroleum and chemical product tankers industry construct a significant number of new tankers or large capacity integrated or articulated tug and barges  demand for our tanker assets could be adversely affected 
if we do not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of our common stock  we could be prohibited from operating our offshore support vessels  inland river vessels and barges and tankers in parts of the us and could be prohibited from operating our helicopters  which would adversely impact our business and operating results 
we are subject to the shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels  tankers and barges used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us we are also subject to regulations pursuant to the federal aviation act of  as amended  and other statutes aviation acts 
generally  our aircraft operating in the us must be registered in the us in order to register such aircraft under the aviation acts  we must be owned or controlled by us citizens 
although our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the shipping acts  and also comply with the aviation acts  we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and our helicopters in the us during any period in which we did not comply with these regulations 
marine transportation services could lose jones act protection  which would result in additional competition 
a substantial portion of marine transportation services operations is conducted in the us coastwise trade 
under the merchant marine act of  which is also referred to as the jones act  this trade is restricted to vessels built in the united states  owned and manned by us citizens and registered under us law 
there have been attempts to repeal or amend the jones act  and these attempts are expected to continue in the future 
repeal of the jones act could result in additional competition from vessels built in lower cost foreign shipyards and owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than us citizens  which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
failure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers 
our customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider 
we must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to our customers 
should this not be achieved  the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected 
the outer continental shelf lands act  as amended  provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas 
because offshore marine operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  the government s exercise of authority under the provisions of the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla  to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
operational risks could disrupt offshore marine services  marine transportation services  harbor and offshore towing services and aviation services and expose us to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels  tankers  tugs  and helicopters is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure and collision 
additional risks to vessels include sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of our personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  we could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
aviation services may be subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from aviation services is dependent on actual flight hours 
prolonged periods of adverse weather  storms and the effect of fewer hours of daylight adversely impact aviation services 
winter months generally have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year with poor visibility  high winds  heavy precipitation and fewer daylight hours all adversely affecting the operations of helicopters 
june through november is tropical storm season in the us gulf of mexico  during tropical storms  helicopters are unable to operate in the area of the storm 
in addition  many of aviation services facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 
revenue from our tanker segment and towing activities could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for domestic refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products  or a change in existing methods of delivery 
a reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products may adversely affect revenue from our tanker segment and towing activities 
weather conditions also affect demand for our tanker services and towing services 
for example  a mild winter may reduce demand for heating oil in our areas of operation 
moreover  alternative methods of delivery of refined petroleum  natural gas or crude oil may be developed and therefore reduce demand for our services 
finally  a reduction in domestic refining capacity would reduce demand for our services 
construction of additional refined petroleum product  natural gas or crude oil pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our tanker and towing revenues 
long haul transportation of refined petroleum products  crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by tanker 
existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in  or do not reach all of  the markets served by our tankers 
new pipeline segments are being planned and approved for the florida market 
the construction and operation of these pipelines could have an adverse effect on our tanker and towing businesses 
we may have to phase out some of our single hull tankers from petroleum product transportation service in us waters 
opa establishes a phase out schedule  depending upon vessel size and age  for non double hull vessels carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation 
the phase out dates for our non double hull tankers are as follows seabulk magnachem  seabulk power  seabulk trader  seabulk challenge and seabulk america as a result of this requirement  unless these vessels are modified with double hulls  which will require substantial capital expenditures  they will be prohibited from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after their phase out dates 
they would also be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most foreign and international markets under a more accelerated international maritime organization international phase out schedule  were we to attempt to enter those markets 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the us coast guard  occupational safety and health administration  the national transportation safety board and the us customs service and to regulation by port states and class society organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  as well as to international regulations from international treaties such as the safety of life at sea solas convention administered by port states and class societies 
the us coast guard  occupational safety and health administration  and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
our business and operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of oil and hazardous materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection and occupational safety and health 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes  and the phase out of certain product tankers 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations 
some environmental laws impose strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources  which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
we cannot be certain that existing laws  regulations or standards  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for more information  see governmental regulation environmental compliance in item spill response revenue is subject to significant volatility 
environmental services response revenues are event driven and can vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on the number and magnitude of responses 
as a result  environmental services profitability may also vary greatly from year to year 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for environmental services services 
environmental services is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa  international conventions and  to a lesser extent  upon local regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for environmental services services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for environmental services oil spill response services could be adversely impacted 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization  or osro would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified by the us coast guard as an osro 
the us coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills 
us coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers because customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the us coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  environmental services could lose customers 
environmental services could incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although environmental services is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption might not apply if it were found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it were to have failed to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect environmental services against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which environmental services provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority were to determine that environmental services does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  environmental services could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
inland river services could experience variation in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges changes 
volume of freight transported on the inland waterways may vary as a result of various factors  such as global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic and international agricultural production and demand and foreign currency exchange rates 
barge participation in the industry will also vary year to year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service 
extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations can be adversely affected by the decline in us grain exports 
inland river services business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through us gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including the crop harvest yield levels in the us and abroad 
the shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for us grain 
conversely  an abundance of grain overseas can decrease demand for us grain 
a decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity  which would likely lower freight rates earned by inland river services 
inland river services results of operations can be adversely affected by international economic and political factors 
the actions of foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by inland river services 
foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities inland river services transports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports and or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the demand for transportation of the cargoes inland river services transports 
these actions or developments could have an adverse impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations are affected by seasonal activity 
inland river services business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower during the first and second quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth quarters july through december during the grain harvest 
inland river services results of operations are affected by adverse weather and river conditions 
weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice conditions during winter months  both of which can hamper barge navigation 
locks on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes  which may delay barge movements 
these conditions could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations 
for the most part  inland river services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors 
it is indirectly exposed to increases in fuel prices  as vendors will adjust the price of the services when fuel prices escalate 
if this happens  inland river services results of operation may be adversely affected 
we may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate  have a significant impact on our business 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of our business 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in our business 
we cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in our businesses 
we maintain insurance coverage against the risks related to our businesses 
there can be no assurance  however  that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  we could be exposed to substantial liability 
our global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
in some of our foreign businesses  we collect revenues and pay expenses in local currency 
if the value of foreign currencies in particular the value of the pound sterling  the currency in the united kingdom  where most of our currency exchange risk arises decline against the us dollar and we do not or are not able to minimize the effects of such fluctuations through currency hedging arrangements  our operating results may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
attracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of our business segments is an important factor in our future success 
the market for the personnel we employ is very competitive and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future
