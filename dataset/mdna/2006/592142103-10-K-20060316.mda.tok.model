item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december   substantially all of the company s revenues were directly or indirectly derived from reimbursements generated by medicare advantage health plans 
as a result  the company s revenue and profitability are dependent on government funding levels for medicare advantage programs 
see item description of business medicare  medicare modernization act 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of metropolitan s revenue came from the humana agreements 
the humana agreements have one year terms and renew automatically each december for additional one year terms unless terminated for cause or upon days prior notice 
failure to maintain the humana agreements on favorable terms would adversely affect metropolitan s results of operations and financial condition 
the humana agreements and mhp s agreement with cms are risk agreements under which the psn and mhp  respectively  receive net monthly payments per participating member at a rate established by the agreements  also called a capitated fee 
in accordance with the agreements  the capitated fee is a function of the number of participating members  regardless of the actual utilization rate of covered services 
to the extent that the participating members require more care than is anticipated  aggregate capitation fees may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with the treatment of such members 
if medical expenses exceed the company s estimates  except in very limited circumstances  it will be unable to increase the premiums it receives under these contracts during the then current terms 
relatively small changes in the company s ratio of medical expense to revenue can create significant changes in its financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
see item b 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note on pages f through f of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables and use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
the most significant area requiring estimates relate to the psn s arrangement with humana and such estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events  and accordingly  actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
with regard to revenues  expenses and receivables arising from the humana agreements  metropolitan estimates amounts it believes will ultimately be realizable based in part upon estimates of ibnr claims incurred but not reported and estimates of retroactive adjustments or unsettled costs to be applied by humana 
the ibnr estimates are made by humana utilizing actuarial methods and are continually evaluated by metropolitan s management based upon its specific claims experience 
with regards to mhp  the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an ibnr estimate based on management s best estimate of medical benefits payable  in conjunction with an independent actuarial firm 
it is reasonably possible that some or all of these estimates could change in the near term by an amount that could be material to the financial statements 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables and risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported during  the company incurred approximately million of medical costs related to the implantation of certain implantable automatic defibrillators aicd s 
cms has directed that the costs of certain of these procedures that meet eligibility requirements be paid by cms  rather than billed to medicare advantage plans 
the company is working with humana and the related providers to secure reimbursement for these amounts  and has estimated a recovery of approximately million at december  it is reasonably possible that this estimate could change in the near term by an amount that could be material to the financial statements 
use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million at december  realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are modified and those changes could be material see notes to consolidated financial statements  note use of estimates  deferred tax asset and note income taxes 
in the future  if metropolitan determines that it cannot  on a more likely than not basis  realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to establish or record an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
off balance sheet arrangements metropolitan does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on metropolitan s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors
