critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated financial statements most significantly 
you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated condensed financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
derivatives derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that all derivatives be included on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at fair value and that changes in fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if such hedge accounting criteria are met  the change is deferred in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the deferred items are recognized in the period the derivative contract is settled 
as of december   we had not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges and therefore are required to mark them to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period 
in early  we adopted a hedging policy and we expect to use hedge accounting in the future 
product exchanges we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange lpgs with third parties 
we record the balance of lpgs due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of lpgs due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
revenue recognition for our terminalling and storage segment  we recognize revenue monthly for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  we recognize revenue based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
for our marine transportation segment  we recognize revenue for contracted trips upon completion of the trips 
for time charters  we recognize revenue based on the daily rate 
for our natural gas lpg services segment  we recognize natural gas gathering and processing revenues when title passes or service is performed 
lpg distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck to our lpg customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize lpg distribution revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
for our sulfur segment  we recognize revenue for product delivered by truck upon the delivery of sulfur to our 
table of contents customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
for our fertilizer segment  we recognize revenue when the customer takes title to the product  either at our plant or the customer s facility 
equity method investments on july   we acquired the remaining interests in cf martin sulphur not previously owned by us 
subsequent to the acquisition  cf martin sulphur is included in the consolidated financial presentation of our sulfur segment 
prior to the acquisition  we used the equity method of accounting for our interest in cf martin sulphur because we owned an unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in this entity 
following our acquisition of prism gas in november  we own an unconsolidated interest in waskom gas processing company  the matagorda offshore gathering system  and the panther interstate pipeline energy llc 
as a result  they are accounted for by the equity method and we do not include any portion of their net income in our operating income 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets 
we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
we have performed the annual impairment tests as of september   september  and september   respectively 
in performing such tests  we determined we had four reporting units which contained goodwill 
these reporting units were four of our reporting segments marine transportation  natural gas lpg services  sulfur and fertilizer 
we determined fair value in each reporting unit based on a multiple of current annual cash flows 
we determined such multiple from our recent experience with actual acquisitions and dispositions and valuing potential acquisitions and dispositions 
environmental liabilities we have historically not experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
asset retirement obligation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  we recognize and measure our asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement cost upon acquisition of the related asset 
subsequent measurement and accounting provisions are in accordance with sfas on march   the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas fin  which was effective for fiscal years ending after december   clarifies that the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas apply to asset retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future 
table of contents event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
we have recognized asset retirement obligations  where appropriate 
reclassifications as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended september   which was filed with the sec on november   we converted to a new accounting system in august in connection with the system conversion  we closely examined expense classifications under the new system 
upon review  it was determined that certain payroll  property insurance and property tax expenses that were previously categorized as selling  general and administrative expenses would be more appropriately classified as operating expenses or costs of products sold 
as a result  those expenses were set up in the new system with the new classification 
accordingly  it is necessary for us to reclassify the related expense items for fiscal years   and since the reclassifications  as indicated in the tables set forth below  had no impact on the prior periods revenues  operating income  cash flows from operations or net income  we have determined that the reclassifications are not material to our audited financial statements for the prior periods 
nonetheless  we are effecting the reclassifications for prior periods in order to provide comparative clarity and consistency among the annual periods when compared to our financial reporting for our current fiscal year 
the following tables set forth the effects of the reclassifications on certain line items within our previously reported consolidated statements of income for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands  which statements of income and certain relevant footnotes thereto as well as the relevant portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for those periods have been updated

our marine transportation revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our inland marine assets  coupled with leased inland marine assets generated an additional million in revenue due to stronger customer demand  higher equipment utilization  and charging our inland customers the increase in our fuel costs 
partially offsetting these increases in inland revenue was a decrease of million in offshore revenues as a result of decreased utilization and downtime as upgrades were performed to prepare to handle petroleum products 
because the majority of our inland equipment is on time charter  the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita was minor

seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly lpgs and fertilizers  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for lpgs is strongest during the winter heating season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses and the molten sulfur business of cf martin sulphur are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive a majority of our net income from our terminalling and storage  marine transportation and sulfur businesses 
therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
however  extraordinary weather events  such as hurricanes  have in the past  and could in the future  impact our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses 
for example  hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter of adversely impacted our operating expenses and the four hurricanes that impacted the gulf of mexico and florida in the third quarter of adversely impacted our terminalling and storage and marine transportation business s revenues

we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased costs to our customers 
increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
diesel fuel  natural gas  chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses 
an increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income

as a result  our profitability is sensitive to changes in the market price of lpgs 
lpgs are a commodity and the price we pay for them can fluctuate significantly in response to supply and other market conditions over which we have no control 
when there are sudden and sharp decreases in the market price of lpgs  we may not be able to maintain our margins 
consequently  sudden and sharp decreases in the wholesale cost of lpgs could reduce our gross profits 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to market risk by maintaining a balanced inventory position by matching our physical inventories and purchase obligations with sales commitments 
other than the current and anticipated hedging arrangements noted above  we have not historically acquired and held inventory or derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
we entered into the current hedging arrangements with an investment grade subsidiary of a major oil company and investment grade banks 
while we anticipate that future derivative transactions will be entered into with investment grade counterparties  and that we will actively monitor the credit rating of such counterparties  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
our principal customers with respect to prism gas natural gas gathering and processing are large  natural gas marketing services and industrial end users 
in addition  substantially all of our natural gas and ngl sales are made at market based prices 
this concentration of credit risk may affect our overall credit risk in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other factors 
our standard gas and ngl sales contracts contain adequate assurance provisions which allow us to suspend deliveries  cancel agreements or continue deliveries to the buyer after the buyer provides security for payment in a form satisfactory to us 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility as of the date hereof 
based on the amount of debt owed by us on december   the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually 
as of march   we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility 
the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually
