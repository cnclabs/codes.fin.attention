item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures and markets high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure  high end computing and aerospace markets 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  new york  arizona and california 
the company s products are marketed and sold under the nelco  nelcote formerly fibercote and neltec names 
the global electronics manufacturing industry  which had become extremely and unsustainably overheated in the s and into calendar year  collapsed in calendar year  and has not recovered since that collapse 
the company believes that that industry has become a mature industry  and the company does not expect significant non cyclical  sustainable growth from that industry in the future 
the company s net sales increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared with the fiscal year ended february  as a result of increases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials in north america  asia and europe and increases in sales of the company s advanced composite materials  and the company achieved higher operating profits and higher net earnings in the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were increased by a tax benefit of million recognized by the company in the fiscal year third quarter relating to the reversal of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets recorded in the united states in prior periods and were reduced by a tax charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the repatriation of approximately million of accumulated earnings and profits of the company s nelco products pte 
ltd 
subsidiary in singapore  a pre tax asset impairment charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter for the write off of construction costs related to the installation of a treater at the company s neltec europe sas facility in mirebeau  france and a pre tax employment termination benefits charge of million related to a workforce reduction at the company s neltec europe sas facility recorded in the fiscal year first quarter ended may  the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were increased by a million gain related to insurance proceeds from the november accident at the company s singapore facility and reduced by an employment termination benefits charge of million related to workforce reductions at the company s north american and european volume printed circuit materials operations recorded in the third quarter ended november  the improvement in the company s operating performance during the fiscal year was attributable principally to increases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products and cost reductions resulting primarily from the workforce reductions at the company s north american and european printed circuit materials operations in the fiscal year and the 
table of contents workforce reduction at the company s neltec europe sas facility in france during the fiscal year 
although the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products improved somewhat in the second half of the fiscal year and the first half of the fiscal year  those markets weakened in the second half of the fiscal year and continued to be mixed in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year but improved somewhat in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
consequently  sales of the company s printed circuit materials increased in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters and in the full year compared to the comparable periods in the fiscal year and the full fiscal year 
the aerospace markets for the company s advanced composite materials were healthy during the fiscal year  and  as a result  sales of the company s advanced composite materials increased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
despite mixed conditions in almost all markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials  the company s operating profits in the fiscal year were greater than its operating profits in the fiscal year principally as a result of higher total sales  higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products and the company s reductions of its costs and expenses 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials will be in the fiscal year 
the aerospace markets for the company s advanced composite materials continued to be healthy during the fiscal year fourth quarter  and the company believes that such markets will continue to be healthy during the fiscal year first and second quarters 
in the first quarter of the fiscal year  the company completed the construction of a new manufacturing facility in the zhahai free trade zone in guangdong province in southern china to support the growing demand for advanced printed circuit materials in china  and the company is in the process of installing equipment for the facility 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company installed one of its latest generation  high technology treaters in its newly expanded facility in singapore  and during the fiscal year second quarter  the company completed the installation of an additional large treater at its nelcote formerly fibercote advanced composite materials facility in waterbury  connecticut  which has significantly increased the treating capacity of that facility 
while the company continued to expand and invest in its business during the fiscal year  it made additional adjustments to certain of its operations  which resulted in workforce reductions 
in the fiscal year first and second quarters  the company reduced the size of the workforce at its neltec europe sas subsidiary in mirebeau  france  as a result of further deterioration of the european market for high technology printed circuit materials  and it recorded an employment termination benefits charge of million during the fiscal year first quarter ended may   million of which was reversed in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company reduced the sizes of the workforces at its north american and european printed circuit materials operations  as a result of which the company recorded pre tax charges of million in the fiscal year third quarter 

table of contents in the fiscal year third quarter  the company also settled an insurance claim for property and business interruption losses sustained by the company in singapore as a result of an explosion in one of the four treaters located at its nelco manufacturing facility in singapore and recorded a pre tax gain of million as a result of the settlement 
during the fiscal year  the company opened a facility at its advanced products business unit in arizona that had been completed in its fiscal year and that is now being well utilized  and completed the construction of its facility expansion in singapore 
during the first half of the fiscal year  the company realigned its north american volume printed circuit materials operations located in new york and california 
as part of the realignment  the new york operation was scaled down to a smaller  focused operation and the california operation was scaled up to a larger volume operation  and there were workforce reductions at the company s new york facility and workforce increases at the company s california facility  with the end result being a net reduction in the company s workforce in north america 
a portion of the new york facility was mothballed 
the realignment was designed to help the company achieve improved operating and cost efficiencies in its north american volume printed circuit materials operations and to help the company best service all of its north american customers 
as a result of the company s realignment of its north american volume printed circuit materials operations and related workforce reductions  the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million and million in the company s fiscal year first quarter and second quarter  respectively 
the company also recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year third quarter resulting from the sale of real estate previously used by its nelco uk subsidiary  which had ceased operations after its closure in the fiscal year third quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the realignment and closure 
in february  the company discontinued its financial support of dielektra gmbh  the company s wholly owned subsidiary located in cologne  germany dielektra  which supplied electronic materials to european circuit board manufacturers 
the company discontinued its support of dielektra because the market in europe had eroded to the point where the company believed it would not be possible  at any time in the foreseeable future  for the dielektra business to be viable 
dielektra had required substantial financial support from the company 
the discontinuation of the company s financial support resulted in the filing of an insolvency petition by dielektra 
the company continues to service the higher technology european digital and rf circuit board markets through its neltec europe sas facility located in mirebeau  france  and its neltec sa facility located in lannemezan  france 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company treated dielektra as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the company reclassified dielektra s operating losses and charges and recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra  million related to the closure of dielektra s mass lamination operation and related workforce reductions in the fiscal year first quarter and million for the write off of assets of dielektra and other costs  and the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year of million  comprised of million of operating losses incurred by dielektra and million for after tax fixed asset impairment charges 
the company s sales for the fiscal year did not include any 
table of contents sales by dielektra  and dielektra had no impact on the company s results of operations during the fiscal year 
furthermore  the company s sales from its continuing operations did not include sales by dielektra of million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information regarding the discontinued operations 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total worldwide sales were to delco  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  nti located in tempe  arizona  had been delco s principal supplier of semi finished multilayer printed circuit board materials  commonly known as mass lamination  which were used by delco to produce finished multilayer printed circuit boards 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the remainder of the fiscal year and have been nil since that time 
in may  the company and nti filed a complaint against delco and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of million  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of million 
both parties appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco  and in may  a panel of three judges in the court of appeals for the ninth circuit rendered a unanimous decision affirming the jury verdict 
in june  the united states district court for the district of arizona entered final judgment in favor of nti  and  on july   nti received a net amount of million in payment of such judgment 
the company recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fiscal year second quarter related to such payment

table of contents the company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures  which include special items  such as the tax benefit relating to the reversal of valuation allowances and the earnings repatriation tax charge  asset impairment charge and employment termination benefits charge in the fiscal year 
accordingly  in addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with gaap  the company discloses non gaap operating results that exclude certain items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the company s operating performance  since the company s on going  normal business operations do not include such special items 
such non gaap financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s sales of both its printed circuit materials and its advanced composite materials increased in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february   following increases in such sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the increased sales in the fiscal year and a further improvement in the company s gross profit margin in the fiscal year  following a substantial improvement in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  enabled the company s continuing operations to generate a larger gross profit than in the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was substantially higher than the gross profit in the prior fiscal year as a result of increased sales  the company s reductions of its costs and expenses and higher percentages of sales by the company of its higher margin  high technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials 
these improvements in gross profits occurred despite the operating inefficiencies resulting from operating certain facilities at levels below their designed manufacturing capacities and the competitive pressures that existed in the fiscal year and persisted in the year 
the company s financial results of operations were adversely affected by the pre tax asset impairment charge of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year fourth quarter for the write off of construction costs related to the installation of a treater at the company s neltec europe sas facility in mirebeau  france in a prior year  the tax charge of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year fourth quarter in connection with the repatriation of approximately million of accumulated earnings and profits of its nelco subsidiary in singapore and the pre tax charge of million that the company recorded in the fiscal year first quarter for employment termination benefits resulting from a workforce reduction at its neltec europe sas printed circuit materials facility in mirebeau  france  which were only partially offset by the reversal in the fiscal year fourth quarter of million of the previous charge for employment termination benefits at neltec europe sas and by the tax benefit of million that the company recognized in the fiscal year third quarter related to the reversal of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets previously recorded in the united states 
sales of the company s advanced composite materials increased during the fiscal year primarily as a result of the strength of the aerospace markets for advance composite materials

environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future

in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pre tax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december  the following information is provided regarding critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that entail  to a significant extent  the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment 

table of contents general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales allowances  accounts receivable  allowances for bad debts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  restructurings  contingencies and litigation  and pensions and other employee benefit programs 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the time title to product is transferred to a customer 
all material sales transactions are for the shipment of manufactured prepreg and laminate products and advanced composite materials 
the company ships its products to customers based upon firm orders  with fixed selling prices  when collection is reasonably assured 
sales allowances the company provides for the estimated costs of sales allowances at the time such costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s products are made to customer specifications and tested for adherence to such specifications before shipment to customers 
there are no future performance requirements other than the products meeting the agreed specifications 
the company s bases for providing sales allowances for returns are known situations in which products may have failed due to manufacturing defects in the products supplied by the company 
the company is focused on manufacturing the highest quality printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials possible and employs stringent manufacturing process controls and works with raw material suppliers who have dedicated themselves to complying with the company s specifications and technical requirements 
the amounts of returns and allowances resulting from defective or damaged products have been approximately of sales for each of the company s last three fiscal years 

table of contents accounts receivable the majority of the company s accounts receivable are due from purchasers of the company s printed circuit materials 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due within established payment terms and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than established payment terms are considered past due 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for bad debts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions about future demand for the company s products and market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in the use of the company s assets or strategy of the overall business 
income taxes carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly
