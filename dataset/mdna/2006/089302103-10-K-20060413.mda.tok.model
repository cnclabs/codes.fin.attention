please refer to item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
recent developments what s important now win strategy in  the company initiated a strategic assessment of its operations 
specifically  the company is focusing on opportunities for improved financial performance as a result of a continuing detailed analysis of real estate  operating expenses  and merchandising 
this strategic assessment is resulting in specific initiatives collectively referred to by the company as its win strategy 
we believe that the tactical plans for have been set 
fiscal year will also be a year of significant testing activity to help develop a long term strategic direction for the company 
the following is a discussion of these specific initiatives 
real estate as part of the real estate analysis  on october   the company announced its decision to close approximately underperforming stores in addition to the stores previously planned for closure in fiscal year the company completed its evaluation of underperforming stores in the fourth quarter and  as a result  stores were closed during fiscal year the company does not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of each store after closure 
to determine if cash flows of each closed store met the statement of financial standards sfas no 
criteria for reporting each store in discontinued operations  resulting in their elimination from ongoing operations  the company evaluated a number of qualitative and quantitative factors  including proximity to remaining open stores  physical location within a metropolitan or non metropolitan area  and expected transferability of sales between open and closed stores 
based on these criteria  the company determined that the results of stores should be reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company has included in discontinued operations the net sales and associated costs which were directly related to and specifically identifiable in relation to these stores 
certain costs such as general office  field operations  national advertising  fixed distribution costs  and interest expense were not allocated to discontinued operations because these costs were not specifically identifiable at the store level 
the table below identifies the significant components of income loss from discontinued operations related to these closed stores for fiscal years   and  respectively 
fiscal year in thousands net sales gross margin operating income loss income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax the company s results of discontinued operations in fiscal year include pretax losses in the amount of million as the result of the stores reported in discontinued operations in fiscal year  including million of exit related pretax costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the reversal of pretax charges of million associated with the kb toys business and a pretax non cash impairment charge of million and other related charges of million associated with the reclassification of the pittsfield dc as held for sale and the related write down of its carrying value to fair value less selling cost 
the table below summarizes the type and amount of charges recorded as a result of the store closures and identifies remaining obligations as of january  write down of property  inventory  and deferred rent severance and benefits lease termination costs total in thousands charges payments non cash reductions remaining obligations at january  asset write downs include assets used in normal operations of retail stores and remaining unrecoverable net book values of fixtures  equipment  and signs 
the inventory write downs above are specific to the markdowns associated with liquidation sales conducted at the closed stores  which qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment 
the company records markdowns throughout the year in the normal course of business 
the markdowns associated with the liquidation sales are the only markdowns included in the table above 
future cash outlays related to store closure obligations are anticipated to be million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million thereafter 
operating expenses the company s review of its operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in the general office  field operations  and distribution centers 
realignments of resources were made based on the store closings and lower expected store growth in the near term 
additionally  some redundancies between the closeout store operations and the furniture store operations were eliminated 
merchandising as part of a review of its merchandising strategy  the company in fiscal year closed its stand alone furniture stores  executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover  and exited the frozen food business 
the company is continuing to develop its merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars 
the company has performed customer research and found that brand names  treasure hunt  price  value and savings are most important to its customers 
the company has taken this research and is working with its existing vendors and developing relationships with new vendors to produce a merchandising plan for each category 
certain elements of these plans will be tested and executed in fiscal year the company will monitor the results of these tests to modify future merchandising plans as necessary to achieve its goals 
kb toys and pittsfield distribution center update although the kb toys business emerged from bankruptcy in fiscal year  the claims process associated with the bankruptcy remains open 
as a result of uncertainties associated with the continuance of the bankruptcy claims process  the company believes it is possible that it will continue to receive in fiscal year demands from landlords for guarantees related to the kb lease obligations 
the company is an unsecured creditor of the bankruptcy trust with respect to losses it has incurred in connection with kb lease obligations and is unable to estimate the timing or amount of any recovery it can expect to receive upon resolution of these claims 
accordingly  no recoveries related to the kb toys bankruptcy have been recorded by the company 
in addition  the typical kb lease obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended  amended or modified without the consent of the guarantor 
the company has concluded that its reserve for the kb lease obligations is adequate at january  based on the uncertainties related to the kb lease obligations  the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves as dictated by the facts and circumstances available to the company at each future reporting period 
in the event additional liability arises from future defaults on the kb lease obligations  any related charge would be to discontinued operations 
in fiscal year  the company initiated plans to dispose of the pittsfield dc  which was acquired by the company as a result of an indemnification of a mortgage guarantee satisfied by the company in fiscal year the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is actively being marketed by a reputable broker 
the company has no intention of using this property in its current operations 
as a result  at january   the pittsfield dc has been classified as held for sale  as defined by sfas no 
 and accordingly  its carrying value at january  has been adjusted to its estimated fair value less applicable selling costs  resulting in a pretax non cash impairment charge of million and other related charges of million included in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year as partial consideration for the sale of the kb toys business  the company received a year note from havens corners corporation hcc  a subsidiary of kb acquisition corporation and a party to the bankruptcy proceedings  in the aggregate principal amount of million principal and interest together known as the hcc note 
upon receipt of the hcc note in fiscal year  the company evaluated its fair value and recorded it at an estimated fair value of million 
the note bears interest  on an in kind basis  at the rate of per annum  however  the company discontinued the accrual of interest on the hcc note in fiscal year as a result of the kb toys bankruptcy 
under the kb toys bankruptcy plan  the company expects to receive million as satisfaction of the hcc note 
in fiscal year  the company partially charged off the hcc note in the amount of million in order to reflect a remaining balance receivable of million 
this partial charge off was reported in selling and administrative expenses 
for a discussion of these matters and other matters related to the kb toys business  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
amendment to the credit agreement on october   the company and its lenders entered into an amendment to the credit agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closing plan discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share repurchase program on february   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares 
the company expects the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with such purchases to be completed within one year of the announcement 
common shares acquired through the repurchase program will be available for general corporate purposes

in addition  the company s quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
the company purchases substantial amounts of inventory and incurs higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit loss as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit loss as a percentage of full year furniture growth during fiscal year  the company continued to add furniture departments ranging in size from  to  square feet to its closeout stores 
the furniture department net sales have grown over the last ten years to a level representing of the company s net sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the company offered a furniture assortment within  of its  existing closeout stores at the end of fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year this increase is due to new stores opened in fiscal years and and the comparable store sales increase of for fiscal year comparable store sales are calculated by the company using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of fiscal year this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable stores sales based on other methods 
fiscal year comparable store sales were driven by a increase in the value of the average basket partially offset by a decline in customer transactions 
customer transactions  which declined  continue to be challenging across the discount sector 
from a merchandise perspective  home  which includes furniture  was the best performing category 
as part of the company s merchandising initiatives  clearance markdowns  primarily in the fourth quarter  benefited net sales and comparable store sales and were initiated to reduce inventory levels on slower moving items or classifications 
the following table summarizes comparable store sales  customer transactions  and the value of the average basket for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year comparable store sales customer transactions value of the average basket the company internally evaluates and externally communicates overall sales and merchandise performance based on the following key merchandising categories and believes these categories facilitate analysis of the company s financial performance

the other category includes strong performances in electronics  home appliances  and tools 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this gross margin rate decline of basis points was primarily due to clearance related markdowns  higher inbound freight costs  and certain initial markup related cost pressures such as higher resin based material costs 
inbound freight costs are higher as a result of higher fuel costs and transportation capacity constraints 
the company continues to develop its merchandising strategy focused on increasing gross margin dollars through improved buying decisions  better pricing strategies  and a focus on improving inventory turnover 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year primarily due to costs associated with higher levels of sales and increased carton volume 
the million increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll costs of million  increased store occupancy related costs  including rent and utilities  of million  increased general office costs of million  the partial charge off of the hcc note of million  increased advertising costs of million  and increased distribution and transportation costs of million 
the increase in general office is primarily resulting from an increase in wage and benefit related costs 
outbound distribution and transportation costs  which were included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year outbound distribution and transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the basis point decrease was primarily due to improved efficiency at the distribution centers  particularly the durant dc 
in addition  productivity has improved at the columbus dc after two years of re engineering efforts 
partially offsetting these cost savings were higher diesel fuel costs incurred on outbound freight and higher utility costs at the distribution centers 
depreciation expense depreciation expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the million increase was principally related to new store growth 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the million decrease in interest expense was due to the million debt prepayment charge incurred in fiscal year in connection with the repayment of the million in senior notes privately placed in the senior notes and the retirement of the million secured revolving credit agreement entered into in the credit agreement  lower average borrowings in fiscal year  and a lower effective interest rate in fiscal year the prepayment charge was incurred in order to replace the senior notes  which carried a weighted average yield of  and the credit agreement with the variable rate credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans under the credit agreement at january   was 
income taxes the effective income tax rate of the continuing operations of the company was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the rate was lower in fiscal year because of proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates  the adjustment of loss contingencies to recognize the expiration of the statute of limitations  offset by the write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes including ohio tax reform enacted in the second quarter of fiscal year 
the company anticipates the fiscal year effective income tax rate to fall within a range of to

the company s discontinued operations in fiscal year relate to pretax losses in the amount of million as the result of the stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of million associated with the kb toys business 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year the company attributes this increase principally to new store growth as comparable store sales were flat for fiscal year comparable store sales consisted of a increase in the value of the average basket driven by strong gains in hardlines and home d cor departments  as well as the addition of new furniture departments 
average basket gains were offset by a decrease in the number of customer transactions  which the company believes was principally the result of the impact that macro economic pressure of higher prices for gas  home heating oil  and other commodities had on the company s core customer 
the following table summarizes comparable store sales  customer transactions  and the value of the average basket for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year comparable store sales customer transactions value of the average basket net sales by product category  net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales  and the net sales change in dollars and percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year were as follows fiscal year change in thousands consumables home seasonal and toys other net sales the consumables category includes sales increases in food  health and beauty  paper  and pet

gross margin gross margin dollars increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this gross margin rate decline of basis points was primarily due to lower sales in higher margin merchandise  such as holiday oriented departments in seasonal and toys  an increased markdown rate due to a flat comparable store sales and the need for additional markdowns on seasonally sensitive categories  giftable items with low sell through rates  and selected discontinued styles in furniture 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in fiscal year compared to  million in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the number of stores  costs associated with higher levels of sales  and increased carton volume

because of the contingent nature of this claim  no tax benefit has been recorded for this item 
discontinued operations discontinued operations resulted in a pretax loss of million in fiscal year compared to a pretax loss of million in fiscal year the company s discontinued operations in fiscal year include pretax losses in the amount of million for the results of stores reported in discontinued operations and pretax charges of million associated with the kb toys business

the pricing and fees related to the credit agreement fluctuate based on the company s debt rating 
loans made under the credit agreement may be prepaid by the company without penalty 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement  which would permit the lenders to restrict the company s ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit  and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
on october   the company and the lenders entered into an amendment to the credit agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with its amended financial covenants under the credit agreement at january  the credit agreement permits  at the company s option  borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin 
the credit agreement also permits  as applicable  borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the company and the lenders 
the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding loans at january   was 
the company typically repays and or borrows on a daily basis in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
the daily activity is a net result of the company s liquidity position  which is generally affected by cash inflows such as store cash and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings  wire and other electronic transactions  and other miscellaneous disbursements 
in addition to revolving credit loans  the credit agreement includes a million swing loan sub limit  a million bid loan sub limit  and a million letter of credit sub limit 
at january   the total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement were million  all in swing loans 
the borrowings available under the credit agreement  after taking into account the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million  were million at january  the company utilizes its credit facility primarily to manage ongoing and seasonal working capital 
given the seasonality of the company s business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including the time of year and the company s need to acquire merchandise inventory 
the company anticipates borrowings and letters of credit through the end of may to range between million and million  excluding any impact resulting from the execution of the million share repurchase authorized by the board of directors in february liquidity the primary source of liquidity for the company is cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
at january   working capital was million 
cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal year and resulted primarily from net loss of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a decrease in net assets of million over fiscal year the million decrease in net assets was primarily a result of lower inventory of million  higher accounts payable of million  higher accrued operating expenses of million  and higher other liabilities of million 
the reduction in inventory is primarily a result of fewer stores open at the end of fiscal year compared to prior year and the impact of the markdown clearance sales 
the higher accrued operating expenses are primarily due to the increased current portion of lease obligation resulting from the closure of certain stores before their full lease term expired 
the increase in other liabilities is primarily due to the non current portion of the lease obligation associated with the closed stores and an increase in the non current portion of insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability 
cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal year and resulted primarily from net income of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million partially offset by an increase in net assets of million 
the impact of closing the underperforming stores and the series of markdowns taken on slower moving inventory had the effect of significantly strengthening the company s balance sheet in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year was primarily related to capital expenditures of million and million in each of the respective fiscal years 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were primarily due to opening new stores 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were primarily driven by the re engineering of the columbus dc  remodeling existing stores  and opening new stores 
capital expenditure requirements in fiscal year are anticipated to range between million and million  focused on maintaining existing property and equipment along with a limited number of new store openings and information technology enhancements 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year and related primarily to the net repayment of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year including net repayments of debt of million and acquisition of treasury stock costing million 
the company announced a share repurchase program of million on february   which it expects to complete within one year of the announcement 
the amount of the repurchase program was based in part on the level of cash provided by operations in fiscal year the company continues to believe that it has  or  if necessary  has the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures 
additionally  management is not aware of any current trends  events  demands  commitments  or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on the company s capital resources or liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under the company s contractual obligations at january  payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that the company believes to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that the company ultimately incurs 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by the company as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges or market rates that the company is obligated to pay under contracts it has with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under or the automatic renewal of contracts that provide for the same 
long term debt obligations consist of the total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are permitted under various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin  as well as borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by the company and the lenders 
the company also had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at january  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and the company does not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from the preceding table 
the remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in purchase obligations 
the table assumes that the credit agreement is paid at maturity 
for a further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for the company s retail stores  warehouse space  offices  and certain office equipment 
the future minimum commitments for store  warehouse space  and office operating leases are million 
for a discussion of leases  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require the company to pay for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
the company estimates that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance are million at january  the company has made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for its contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to extrapolation of historical data to estimate the company s future obligations  calculation of the company s obligations based on per square foot averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to certain increases over historical data where the company s obligation is a prorated share of all lessees obligations within a particular property 
the remaining million relates primarily to the operating leases of certain office equipment with remaining terms of less than one year or a month to month basis 
for purposes of the operating lease and purchase obligation disclosures  the company has assumed that it will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and the company disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement of the company and its vendor  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  the company disclosed its minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of the length of the eventual term 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for retail merchandise issued in the ordinary course of the company s business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of january  purchase obligations also include a commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at january  while the company is not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  the company has included the value of the purchases that it anticipates making during each of the reported periods  as purchases will count toward its fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million is primarily related to distribution and transportation commitments 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to kb toys 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   the company has approximately kb lease obligations 
the relevant guarantees were issued prior to january   and are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
the typical kb lease obligation provides that the terms of the underlying lease may be extended  amended  or modified without the consent of the guarantor 
as a result  the company is unable to estimate any potential range of loss in the event of non performance or non performance by kb toys  as applicable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion of kb toys matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  insurance reserves  income taxes  contingencies  leases  and pension 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to reporting its results of operations and financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company s accounting policies 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
under the average cost retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margin 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information 
permanent markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period of management s decision to initiate price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail 
promotional markdowns are recorded as a gross margin reduction in the period the merchandise is sold 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  and seasonal trends 
shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and gross margin and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on the company s actual experience and the company s most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that it believes minimize shrinkage 
long lived assets depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment are recorded on a straight line basis using estimated service lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis using the shorter of their estimated service lives or the lease term 
when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated service life  depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated service life 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major repairs that extend service lives are capitalized 
the estimated service lives by major asset category are as follows land improvements years buildings and leasehold improvements years fixtures and equipment years computer software costs years transportation equipment years long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived asset are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
the company s assumptions related to valuation of long lived assets include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results  and projected cash flows 
the company estimates the fair value of its long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets 
when material  the company classifies the results of operations of closed stores as discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations and the company no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure 
the company generally meets the second criteria on all closed stores as  upon closure  operations cease and the company has no continuing involvement 
to determine if cash flows have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations  the company evaluates a number of qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to  proximity to remaining open stores and estimates of sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open 
the estimated sales migration is based on the company s historical estimates of sales migration upon opening a new store in a similar market 
for purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations  the company reports net sales  gross margin  and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations 
certain corporate level charges  such as general office cost  field operations  national advertising  fixed distribution costs  and interest cost  are not allocated to discontinued operations because the company believes that these costs are not specific to the stores operations 
insurance reserves the company is self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is paid by employees 
the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit significant exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated accruals are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account known trends and projections of future results 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at the company s estimate of their net present value while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
actual future claims experience can impact these calculations and  to the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from estimates  future earnings could be impacted materially 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  the company s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
contingencies the company is subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions  lease termination obligations on closed stores  lease indemnification obligations on kb toys stores  and other claims arising out of the normal course of business 
in connection with such claims and contingencies  the company estimates the likelihood and amounts of any potential obligation using management s judgment 
management uses subject matter experts including various internal and external experts to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from management s estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
with respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations  the company considers the remaining minimum lease payments  estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained  and other potentially mitigating factors 
in addition  as market conditions or other factors change  the estimate of the obligations could be materially different 
the company continually evaluates the adequacy of its recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information  including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations 
the company accrues a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable  or if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable  disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
lease accounting rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease 
the company recognizes minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord  which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening 
when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent  the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent 
the company also receives tenant allowances  which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
pension pension assumptions are evaluated each year 
outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated obligations for pension 
the company reviews external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
the company s objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  the company reviews rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the current or anticipated future allocation of the pension portfolio 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for fiscal year was 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in fiscal year was 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires an entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award using an option pricing model 
the cost of the awards  including the related tax effects  will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
this statement eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method for valuing share based compensation  which typically resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
on april   the sec issued release no 
 which amended the effective date for sfas no 
r  to the first interim or annual period of the first fiscal year beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted sfas no 
r as of january   using the modified prospective method of adoption  in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the date of adoption of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date 
because the company previously accounted for options issued under the company s incentive plans under the intrinsic value method permitted under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
this change in classification will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption for any excess tax benefits realized 
while the amount of this change cannot be estimated at this time  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was not significant in fiscal years   and  respectively

fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  constructions  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted the provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and this adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k
