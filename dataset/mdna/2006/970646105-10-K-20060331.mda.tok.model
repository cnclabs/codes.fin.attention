this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements other than statements of historical fact  including statements regarding prospects or future results of operations or financial position  made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  intends  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the effects on the airline industry and the global economy of events such as terrorist activity  changes in oil prices and other disruptions to the world markets  trends in the airline industry  including growth rates of markets and other economic factors  risks associated with owning and leasing jet engines and aircraft  our ability to successfully negotiate equipment purchases  sales and leases  to collect outstanding amounts due and to control costs and expenses  changes in interest rates and availability of capital  our ability to continue to meet the changing customer demands  regulatory changes affecting airline operations  aircraft maintenance  accounting standards and taxes  the market value of engines and other assets our portfolio 
these risks and uncertainties  as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations  are described in greater detail in item a 
of part i  risk factors  which  along with the previous discussion  describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
general 
our core business is acquiring and leasing pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment  and the selective sale of such engines  all of which we sometimes refer to as equipment 
we have no current plans to enter into finance leases although we may do so in the future 
as of december   we had lessees in countries 
our portfolio is continually changing due to acquisitions and sales 
as of december   our total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  five aircraft and three spare engine parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
on december   we entered into a joint venture with oasis international leasing usa  inc  called wolf 
wolf completed the purchase of two airbus a aircraft from boeing aircraft holding company for a purchase price of million 
we actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets 
our leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engine 
these engines are the most widely used engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  and mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  bad debts  and income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  grouped by our activities  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  we do not recognize revenue until received 
we also estimate and charge to income a provision for bad debts based on our experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december   all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  we retain title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
we generally depreciate engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  we depreciate the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by us  upon sale of the equipment  a loss may be realized 
we review these estimates regularly and a change in either of these estimates would cause an associated change in depreciation expense 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of our lease portfolio  we recognize the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits and reserves are included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
asset valuation 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of generally be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecasted cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the asset s book value minus maintenance reserves 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value  we write the asset down to its fair value 
we determine fair value by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg  an offer to purchase and other factors 
for further information on these and other accounting policies we have adopted  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
restatements our financial statements were restated twice during we restated the form k for the years ended december   and and the form q for the quarter ended march  on august  as a consequence of a review of our financial statement presentation and disclosures during a normal periodic review of our filings by the staff of the securities and exchange commission 
as a result of the review  our financials were restated to reclassify restricted cash into a separate line item on the balance sheet for all periods presented and to reclassify a gain on the prepayment of a debt facility in from revenue to a component of net finance costs 
we concluded that we had a material weakness in our procedures surrounding our financial statement disclosures and classifications and implemented expanded procedures including completion of a financial reporting checklist to ensure compliance with current reporting standards and accounting pronouncements issued since the end of the previous reporting period 
on november   we again restated our form k for the years ended december   and and the forms q for the quarters and year to date periods ended march  and june  for inappropriate application of accounting for derivative related transactions under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 sfas 
in particular  it was determined that the documentation related to our derivative instruments was insufficient to meet the documentation criteria under sfas and as a result that we could not apply hedge accounting to the transactions 
as a result of these restatements  we have reflected the change in the fair value of derivative contracts in the income statement and not in other comprehensive income where the change had previously been recorded 
we concluded that we had a material weakness because we did not maintain effective controls over the documentation and valuation of derivative transactions since the implementation of sfas in specifically  our documentation and effectiveness testing was not reviewed and validated regularly to ensure compliance with sfas and related implementation issues 
we have changed our internal controls over derivative accounting by implementing expanded procedures including a completion of a derivative accounting checklist to ensure compliance with current derivative documentation and accounting standards and accounting pronouncements issued since the end of the previous period 
see management of interest rate exposure below for further information on hedge accounting 
we were delinquent filing our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter ended september  as a result of work necessary to complete our second restatement of our financial statements for  and and the first and second quarters of and year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands lease revenue gain on sale of leased equipment other income total leasing related activities 
our lease related revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects a reduced amount of equipment off lease together with increased average lease rate factors the monthly rent on the engines divided by the net book value of the engines 
the aggregate of net book value of leased equipment at december  and  was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
at december   and  respectively  approximately and of equipment by net book value was on lease

during all periods up to december   we accounted for our interest rate swaps as speculative hedges with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement 
for the year ended december   approximately million in deferred loan fees were written off upon repayment of the prior warehouse credit facility 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in due mainly to increases in net operating costs for corporate aircraft million  increased employment related costs million  increased bad debt expenses million  increased accounting costs million  and offset by reduced insurance costs million 
income taxes 
income taxes for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for the comparable period in reflecting decreased pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate 
the overall effective tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the prior year due to a lower apportionment of income to the state of california and corresponding reduction in the effective state income tax rate 
our tax rate is subject to change based on changes in the mix of assets leased to domestic and foreign lessees  the proportions of revenue generated within and outside of california and numerous other factors  including changes in tax law

our lease related revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects a reduced amount of equipment off lease together with increased average lease rate factors 
the aggregate of net book value of leased equipment at december  and  was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
at december   and  respectively  approximately and of equipment by net book value was on lease 
however  we purchased three engines towards the end of which were off lease at year end 
excluding those engines utilization would have been approximately at december  the average utilization for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
during the year ended december   five engines were added to our lease portfolio at a total cost of million including capitalized costs 
during the year ended december   engines and two aircraft were added to our lease portfolio at a cost of million including capitalized costs

recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  was based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we did not undertake any transaction in that would be affected by this statement 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r which is a revision to fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in sfas no 
sfas no 
applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
we have an employee stock option issuance plan described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements which will be affected by the implementation of sfas no 
r 
currently  under the existing statement we do not recognize compensation cost in respect of our plans and opt to make pro forma disclosure of the impact which is described in note q to our financial statements 
in april  the sec adopted a rule allowing companies to implement sfas no 
r for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r effective january liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through borrowings secured by our equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
on february   we announced the completion of our public offering of  shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or approximately million in total 
after underwriting commissions and expenses of issuance  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  or approximately  per month 
the first dividend payment date  was march  the payment of dividends  including with respect to the series a preferred stock  is at the discretion of our board of directors 
the series a preferred stock  which is a new series of our capital stock  is traded on the nasdaq national market 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and interest expense 
note that cash received from reserves arrangements are restricted per our debt arrangements 
while we have experienced increased lease rates  these have been offset by increases in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has narrowed throughout the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while a substantial amount of our debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of our assets were on lease at december   compared to approximately at december   and the average utilization rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
if there is any increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of loans totaling million payable over periods of less than year to approximately years with interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of our interest rate derivative instruments 
the significant facilities are described below 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the facility matures in may the interest rate on this facility at december   was month libor plus 
under the revolver facility  all subsidiaries except wlfc ac and west engine funding llc jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus accrued interest and fees 
the guarantee would be triggered by a default under the agreement 
on august   we closed the asset backed securitization through a newly created  bankruptcy remote  delaware statutory trust  willis engine securitization trust west 
west issued and sold million of term notes and approximately million of warehouse notes 
the warehouse notes allow for borrowings during a two year term  after which it is expected that they will be converted to term notes of west 
the assets and liabilities of west remain on our balance sheet at historical carrying value 
the net proceeds of the term notes issued by west were used primarily to repay the obligations under our previous warehouse facility  which was terminated 
as a result of this transaction we wrote off approximately million of unamortized capitalized costs associated with the previous facility 
under our previous warehouse debt facility  willis engine funding llc now known as west engine funding llc  was a wholly owned special purpose entity created in for the purpose of financing jet aircraft engines 
the facility had a revolving period which ended march   followed by a four year amortization period  during which of the net rents from the collateral were used to pay down principal  followed by a final balloon payment 
the facility s structure was designed to facilitate the issuance of public or private securitized notes 
the facility notes were paid off at the closing of the west securitization for million the amount then outstanding on the facility notes  million class a notes and million class b notes 
at december   we had million of west term notes and million of west warehouse notes were outstanding 
the term notes are divided into million series a notes and million series b notes 
the warehouse notes are divided into million series a notes and million series b notes 
the assets of west  west engine funding and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy our obligations or any of our affiliates 
west is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
at december   interest on the series a notes and series a notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
at december   interest on the series b notes and the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and a supplemental margin of  for a total margin of 
at december   we had warehouse and revolving credit facilities totaling approximately million compared to million at december  at december   and december   respectively  approximately million and million was available under these combined facilities 
at december   one month libor was and at august   the commercial paper rate related to the previous warehouse debt facility was approximately 
at december   the one month libor rate was approximately 
approximately million of our debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments under long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total approximately million of the above debt is subject to our continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  we can typically borrow of an engine purchase and only between to of an aircraft or spare parts purchase under these facilities  so we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or it will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we have estimated the interest payments due under long term debt by applying the interest rates applicable at december  to the remaining debt  adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above 
actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates for one month libor and commercial paper as applicable 
the interest estimate excludes the effect of any derivative instruments in place at the balance sheet date 
we have commitments to purchase  during  three new engines for a gross purchase price of between million and million depending on thrust rating elected  for delivery from january to december the lease of our office premises in sausalito expires on december  the sub lease of our premises in san diego expires in october our shanghai  china office lease expires in june we believe our equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds  such as could result if off lease rates increase or there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities  would impair our ability to sustain our level of operations 
we are discussing additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks 
if we are not able to access additional capital  our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of our borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to libor or commercial paper rates 
our equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue we realize under our leases and the interest rate that we pay under our borrowings 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk and not to speculate or trade in these derivative products 
we currently have interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between and months and fixed rates of between and 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was positive million and million  respectively  representing a net asset for us 
we have also purchased an interest rate cap with a notional amount of million  a remaining term of four months  and the rate capped at 
on october   the audit committee of our board of directors determined that we should restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the three year period ended december   and the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three month periods ended march  and  and the three and six month periods ended june  and due to documentation deficiencies related to accounting for interest rate derivative contracts under sfas as a result of this announced restatement we were unable to file our quarterly report on form q on the due date and were not in compliance with several of our bank agreements which require that we deliver financial statements in a timely manner prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a waiver from each of the affected banks was obtained 
commencing december  we applied hedge accounting per sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to record derivative instruments at fair value as either an asset or liability 
beginning in january  derivative instruments were recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
we use derivative instruments primarily for interest rate swaps to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
while substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into for the purposes described above  hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria have been met and it is practicable to do so 
in order to apply hedge accounting  the transaction must be designated as a hedge and it must be highly effective 
the hedging instrument s effectiveness is assessed utilizing regression analysis at the inception of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its life 
hedges are considered highly effective when a correlation coefficient between 
and is achieved 
all of the transactions that we have designated as hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these hedges flows through earnings in the current period 
settlement gains and losses are recorded in interest expense 
prior to december   changes in the derivatives fair values were recognized in earnings in realized and unrealized gains and losses derivative instruments  after that date hedge accounting was applied 
net finance costs for the years ended december  and december   were decreased by million and million due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments  respectively 
for the year ended december   net finance costs were increased by million due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments 
realized and unrealized gains includes both the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as the cash settlement expense or income due to the derivative instruments for the period 
the changes to the components of realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for each of the years ended december   and are shown in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease to net finance costs change in fair value of derivative instruments cash settlement expense total realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments we will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
we anticipate that we may hedge additional amounts of our floating rate debt during the next year 
related party and similar transactions we occasionally sell or consign engines to and purchase materials from avioserv  the successor to our former subsidiary and current subsidiary of t group america 
t group america is owned by t group f k a sr technics group  an entity that is related to flighttechnics llc  which holds of our common stock 
we also sub lease office space from avioserv with the lease term expiring october  during the year ended december   we sold one engine to avioserv at a net gain of  during the year ended december   we consigned one engine to avioserv and no parts of the engine were sold

islandair s obligations under four of these leases are guaranteed by aloha 
however  in december  aloha filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
with its emergence from chapter in february  aloha s obligations under its guaranty were discharged 
the five leases are still performing and the lessee is current on all obligations and no provision has been made for any loss 
we entered into a consignment agreement dated april   with avsets

there is no remaining book value for the parts consigned to avsets 
com as of december  and jtpower s sales responsibilities have ended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the libor rates would affect our cost of borrowing 
increases in interest rates to us  which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers  could result in a reduction in demand for our leases 
alternatively  we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
approximately million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we estimates a one percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
we estimate a two percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
we hedge a portion of our borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
based on the implied forward rates for month libor  we expect interest expenses will be reduced by approximately million for the year ending december   as a result of our hedges 
such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect us from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
we are also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during   and  respectively    and of our total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of our leases require payment in us dollars 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments
