table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth previously under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of cardiovascular imaging services and solid state nuclear medicine imaging products to physician offices  hospitals and imaging centers 
we were the first company to develop and commercialize a solid state medical gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are mobile as well as fixed and provide enhanced operability and improved patient comfort and utilization and  in the case of our cardius system  shorter image acquisition time  when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras 
the cameras and accompanying equipment fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures directly in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital 
revenues our revenues are generated within two primary operating segments our dis business and product sales 
dis collectively refers to our wholly owned subsidiaries  digirad imaging solutions  inc and digirad imaging systems  inc through dis  we offer a comprehensive and mobile imaging leasing program  called fleximaging 
this mobile imaging service is an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging procedures in their offices but wish to outsource the leasing of the imaging system  certified personnel  needed licensure and other support required to perform nuclear imaging in the physician office 
fleximaging is provided under the supervision of our physician customers 
we also offer digitech leases  a service similar to fleximaging services  except that our customer owns our camera 
dis leasing services are currently provided in states and the district of columbia  primarily to cardiologists and internists 
physicians enter into annual contracts for imaging services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to three times per week  adjusted for holidays and vacations 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business as a result of summer slowdowns  principally relating to vacations and holidays  and inclement weather 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras  upgrades and accessories  such as viewing workstations  networking solutions and other ancillary items  and from our maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
we do not anticipate that the international market will be a significant source of revenues in the foreseeable future 
currently  we purchase some components  including key components of the detector heads and software components utilized in our gamma cameras  from sole source providers and in many cases  are either qualifying or seeking second source providers in an effort to limit our reliance on these suppliers 
if we were unable to obtain these components  our ability to build gamma cameras could be materially affected 
we are currently outsourcing some portions of our production process and may outsource additional production activities in the future 
highlights consolidated revenues were million in  which was nearly unchanged from the prior year as sales growth in our dis business offset the decrease in revenue generated by our product segment 
in dis  revenue increased to million  and in the product business  revenue declined to million 
we recorded a consolidated net loss of million as compared to net income of million in  principally as a result of significantly reduced product sales in the second and third quarters of  after the departure of key 
table of contents management and sales personnel  lower gross margins in the dis business due to the approximately million impact of reducing the depreciable life of the dis fleet of cameras in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements  a decline in staff productivity and system utilization  and an increase in costs to operate as a public company  including costs associated with of our internal control efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in april of  gary burbach  an existing board member  assumed the role of ceo of digirad 
later in the year  we filled other key executive positions by naming mark casner as president of dis  peter sullivan as senior vice president of operations and randy weatherhead as head of marketing 
in january  mr 
burbach resumed his role solely as a board member of the company  mr 
casner was promoted to ceo of digirad  mr 
sullivan was promoted to president of digirad s product division and mr 
weatherhead took over as head of sales and marketing 
we also made key hires in the sales department  hiring three regional sales vice presidents 
in the summer of  we received validation of the technical capabilities of our cardius imaging system  our dedicated cardiac triple head camera which we believe remains the only such camera currently on the market 
a clinical study determined that the cardius camera s image acquisition time is percent faster than that of a competitor s traditional dual head camera  while maintaining the same image quality and clinical results 
the cardius imager s speed allows for higher patient throughput and thus makes it well suited for high volume cardiology practices  hospitals and outpatient imaging centers 
we also completed clinical testing of the mobile version of the cardius and intend to replace much of our dis camera fleet with the mobile cardius over the next three years 
during  we expanded our dis presence from to states  and increased the number of mobile cameras we operate from to our dis business performed more than  studies in  as compared to  studies in the comparable prior year period  resulting in an increase in revenue per study to in from in our dis gross margins  however  declined to  principally due to the approximately million impact of reducing the depreciable life of the dis fleet of cameras from seven years to five years in the fourth quarter of  and a decline in staff productivity and system utilization 
our product business experienced a decline in gross margin to in  due mainly to our underperformance in sales during the second and third quarter of and the resulting excess manufacturing capacity caused by producing fewer units than in during the third and fourth quarter of  we implemented a number or programs to improve operational efficiencies in the product business  streamlining processes in manufacturing that resulted in reducing net inventory from million to million 
our camera maintenance and service margins also improved each quarter during the year to over in the fourth quarter of we also focused on obtaining additional accreditation and certifications as recently required by some third party payors by accelerating our efforts to obtain certification from the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of nuclear medicine laboratories 
we have obtained accreditation at thirteen of our hub locations  and are working towards obtaining accreditation at nine others 
our market according to industry sources  million nuclear imaging procedures were performed in the united states in  of which million procedures were cardiac specific procedures 
to our knowledge  this industry information has not been updated  the number of imaging procedures we have performed has increased by approximately from  in to  in the national electrical manufacturers association  or nema  estimates that sales of nuclear imaging equipment  excluding the estimated million of maintenance revenue  declined approximately  from million in to million in  and projects an additional sales decline of approximately in according to nema  the total number of new gamma camera units sold declined by some from to in the cardiac segment of the overall nuclear 
table of contents market  sales of new camera units increased by from to units  while digirad s share of the total new cardiac specific gamma camera unit sales decreased from to 
nema attributes the declining sales to questions about reimbursement  lack of technology innovation and shifts to other imaging modalities 
however  we believe dis may benefit from our introduction of technological innovation and our ability to offer differentiated products like our triple head cameras that provide decreased image acquisition times 
we also believe that our imaging systems small size  mobility  and ability to accommodate physicians varying speed and throughput needs offer us competitive advantages in capturing a larger share of the overall nuclear imaging market  and also allow us to capitalize on the shift in delivery of nuclear cardiac imaging from hospitals to physician offices  and from cardiologists to internists and other physicians 
the target market for our products and services is comprised of approximately  cardiologists and the larger practices of four or more practitioners among the  internists and family practitioners in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac procedures 
we estimate that there are approximately  internist practices with more than four internists 
to date  we have provided imaging services through dis to approximately physicians and physician groups  the majority of which are cardiologists  and have sold cameras to customers through our product segment 
we believe our market is negatively affected by continuing pressures by third party payors to reduce health care expenditures  including change by some payors requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications 
our market is also adversely affected by reimbursement changes implemented by medicare and medicaid 
trends and drivers our dis services continued to grow during as compared to due to selling our dis services to new customers and increasing service levels to our existing customers 
however  the rate of growth of our dis business slowed in as we attracted fewer new customers and the number of lease days per new customer declined 
we believe these trends were driven mainly by sales management vacancies  underperformance of our sales force and an increasing proportion of our sales to internists whose practice volumes are lower than those of cardiologists  resulting in fewer annual service days 
sales to internists also appear to have created a moderate lengthening in the dis sales cycle 
furthermore  the number of new digitech leases entered into during decreased as compared to we believe that the number of nuclear imaging procedures performed in physician offices as opposed to hospitals will continue to grow  and that an increasing number of internists will begin to perform these studies in their offices 
we believe that the special characteristics of our imaging systems will allow us to capitalize on these trends and to allow further growth 
in  we intend to improve our dis camera fleet by beginning a measured roll out of our cardius mobile camera to increase patient throughput  shorten the work days of our employees and improve customer satisfaction 
we believe these steps will have a positive impact on improving employee satisfaction and reducing employee turnover  which in was in dis and in the product business including the results of the reduction in force which took place in the third quarter 
we will focus on increasing the delivery efficiencies in our existing hub locations and on continued expansion of dis to new states 
in addition  we intend to complete our icanl accreditation efforts 
in  we will also begin pilot programs in selected markets in the delivery of ultrasound services  leveraging our existing dis infrastructure and knowledge base 
in the product business  industry sources predict that camera sales will decline by approximately in as compared to  and that purchases of multi head cameras will far outpace those of single head cameras 
historically  our single head gamma cameras have represented the majority of our camera sales 
however  consistent with the industry data  we have seen an increasing percentage of our sales shifting to our dual head and triple head cameras 
we will continue to invest in research and development to improve the image quality  speed  reliability and overall performance of our multi headed cameras to enable us to capture an increasing share of the gamma camera market 

table of contents our performance in product sales in the third and fourth quarter of improved over that in the second quarter of  as we began to reorganize our sales management organization and fill open sales positions 
in  we will continue to strengthen our sales team and focus on better execution 
during  we experienced total employee turnover of in the combined product and dis service segments 
we have implemented specific programs designed to reverse this trend

consolidated revenues was million in  which was essentially unchanged from the prior year  as the increase in demand for our dis imaging services offset the decrease in revenue product revenue 
we believe that the increase in demand for our dis imaging services was principally a result of continued increase in physician awareness and acceptance of our services  primarily by internists 
dis and product revenue accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues in  compared to and  respectively  in we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods 
dis 
our dis revenue increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
the increase in dis revenue resulted from an increase in the number of dis service days to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   which was primarily 
table of contents attributable to an increase in the number of physicians entering into our dis services contracts and an increase in the retention of current dis customers 
we deployed nine additional systems during the year ended december  our dis business operated mobile and fixed site systems as of december  we continue to anticipate that our dis revenue will increase as we expand into new markets and continue to penetrate existing markets 
such growth will fluctuate  however  based on seasonality stemming from physician vacations  holidays  inclement weather and start up time required by sales representatives as we enter new geographical areas 
product 
our product revenue decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million  or compared to the decrease in product revenue is attributable to a decline in the sales of gamma cameras resulting primarily from management vacancies in the sales organization  underperforming sales representatives and a decline in the number of single head cameras sold 
maintenance contract revenues were million in and million in we continue to experience pricing pressures on our dual head gamma cameras and  while we expect this pricing pressure to remain  we also anticipate demand will increase as our sales force s performance improves 
gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million or 
the decrease in consolidated gross profit is primarily attributable to the decline in the number of gamma cameras sold during  a decline in staff productivity and dis system utilization  a fourth quarter expense of approximately million resulting from the change in the depreciable life of our dis camera fleet from seven years to five years  unfavorable variances attributable to a reduction in production volumes in the third quarter of  resulting in excess capacity costs of million and inventory related charges of million recorded in the second quarter of consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in dis 
cost of dis revenue consists primarily of labor  radiopharmaceuticals  equipment depreciation and other costs associated with the provision of services 
cost of dis revenue increased to million in  representing an increase of million  or  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of dis leasing days resulting from new contracts with new physicians 
dis gross profit decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million  or 
our clinical and regulatory headcount relating to our dis business increased to employees at the end of from employees at the end of dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the decline in dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of the approximately million depreciation charge in the fourth quarter of discussed above and a decline in staffing productivity and system utilization 
product 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of materials  labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
warranty costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period our cameras are sold and are based on our historical experience with failure rates and repair costs 
cost of goods sold increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
product gross profit decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million  or  primarily as a result of a decline in the number of gamma cameras sold and the unfavorable production variances and inventory charges  primarily incurred in the second and third quarters of product gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
the primary costs are salaries and fringe benefits  consulting fees  development material costs  facility and overhead costs and nonrecurring engineering costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in  which represents an increase of 
table of contents million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development  including a mobile version of our cardius triple head camera 
research and development headcount decreased to employees in from employees in research and development expenses were of total revenue in compared to for our research and development efforts occur principally within our products segment 
in the future  we expect to continue to invest in research and development as we innovate and seek to continue to improve our existing technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  recruiting costs  travel  marketing and collateral materials and tradeshow costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million or  primarily as a result of a reduction of variable compensation associated with camera sales 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in compared to for we expect to increase our sales and marketing effort in the future  as we upgrade our sales work force with more experienced sales representatives  focus on increasing market awareness of our products and offerings  begin to marketing to internists and general practitioners and launch a marketing program for echocardiography and vascular ultrasound 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance and accounting  human resources and other personnel  as well as legal and other professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
increases in headcount  recruiting costs  professional fees  legal costs  costs related to our internal control efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and other costs related to operating as a public company all contributed to increased general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative headcount increased to employees in from employees in general and administrative expenses were of total revenue in compared to for in the normal course of business  we have been and will likely continue to be subject to routine litigation incidental to our business  such as claims related to customer disputes  employment practices  product liability  warranty or patent infringement 
as we continue to grow  we anticipate that the volume of these claims is likely to increase 
the substantial costs of litigation or an unexpected adverse outcome could materially increase our anticipated operating expenses 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of intangibles increased to million in from million in stock based compensation charges 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
options or awards issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and periodically remeasured in accordance with eitf and recognized over the respective service or vesting period 
these amounts are initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are amortized  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to cost of revenues and operations over the vesting period of the options 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded amortization of stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than january  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we will adopt sfas r on january  
table of contents as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
determining the exact impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the assumptions for the variables which affect the computation 
in management s opinion  existing stock option valuation models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options that have vesting provisions and are not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
changes in such subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of employee stock options 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share elsewhere in note of our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense interest income increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances in as a result of our initial public offering  which closed in june interest expense decreased to million in from million in  as a result of the repayment of two credit lines in and a reduction of amounts outstanding on capital leases 
net income loss our net loss was million in compared to net income of million in  as a result of the factors described above 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenues in increased to million  which represents an increase of million  or  primarily as a result of increased demand for our dis services and our cardius products 
we believe that this increased demand was principally a result of increased customer awareness and acceptance of our products and services 
dis and product revenue accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues in  compared to and  respectively  in we expect dis revenue to continue to represent a larger percentage of consolidated revenue 
dis 
our dis revenue increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
the increase in dis revenue resulted from an increase in the number of dis service days to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of physicians purchasing our dis services 
to respond to this demand  we deployed additional systems in the year ended december  dis revenue accounted for of total revenues in versus in collectively  our dis business operated mobile and fixed site systems as of december  although average dis revenue per day increased in as compared to  the mid launch of our digitech leasing program  a personnel only service offered by dis to physicians who have purchased a digirad camera that is priced at a lower per day fee than our traditional fleximaging service offering  resulted in a decline in average dis revenue per day during the second half of product 
our product revenue increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to increased sales of our gamma cameras  maintenance contract revenue  and  for the first time  upgrades from single head cameras to multi head cameras 
we sold cameras  
table of contents not including upgrades  in  compared to cameras  without upgrades in in  we recorded revenue associated with the delivery of our first two cardius systems

gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in primarily as a result of an increase in revenue  and reductions in gamma camera production costs and per unit warranty costs 
dis 
cost of dis revenue increased to million in  representing an increase of million or 
dis gross profit increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or  as a result of increased volumes 
our clinical and regulatory headcount relating to our dis business increased to employees at the end of from employees at the end of dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in although dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased on a year over year basis  it declined in the second half of as a result of lower margin digitech leases and  to a lesser degree  to a decline in system utilization resulting from the expansion of our operations and an increased number of dis customers purchasing nuclear gamma cameras in the third quarter of product 
cost of goods sold decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million  or 
product gross profit increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or  primarily as a result of increased manufacturing volumes and reduced per unit costs resulting from lower warranty costs  fewer and less expensive materials and more efficient manufacturing processes used to build our third generation camera heads introduced in july our third generation camera heads consist of fewer and less expensive materials than our earlier generation camera heads and are produced using more efficient processes that have reduced labor and overhead costs compared to historical rates 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased employee headcount to develop new products such as the cardius which was introduced into the marketplace at the end of the third quarter of research and development headcount increased to employees in from employees in our research and development efforts occur principally within our products segment 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our marketing efforts 
in  sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue versus in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  which represents an increase of million  or 
increases in headcount and recruiting costs  insurance  professional fees and other costs primarily related to operating as a public company all contributed to increased general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative headcount was increased by employees by the end of to employees versus employees at the end of in  general and administrative expenses amounted to of total revenue which represented a slight decrease from in amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decline from to was principally a result of impairment charges recorded in associated with purchased contracts 

table of contents stock based compensation charges 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded as amortization of stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other income expense interest income increased to million in from negligible amounts in  primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances in as a result of our initial public offering  which closed in june interest expense decreased to million in  which represents a decrease of million  or 
the reduction is a result of lower balances on our two credit lines and a reduction of amounts outstanding under capital leases 
net income loss our net income was million in compared to a net loss of million in  which represents an increase of million  as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures 
working capital is required principally to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of dis cameras and vans  computer hardware and software 
through may  we funded our operations principally through private placements of equity securities 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and received net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  high grade auction rate securities and us government or corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering  together with cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations was million in the net cash provided by operations during the period resulted from the reduction in working capital requirements as the cash generated by the reduction in accounts receivable and inventory more than offset the net loss for the period net of non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of stock based compensation 
accounts receivable were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease at the end of compared to the end of  was a result of a reduction in sales compared to the prior years fourth quarter  as well as the improvement in days sales outstanding at both our dis and product businesses 
inventories were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease during was a result of an improvement in our inventory management 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million in  and reflects million of net maturities of our securities available for sale  partially offset by million of capital expenditures primarily associated with our dis operations 
net cash used by financing activities amounted to approximately million in  and primarily reflects the repayment of capital lease obligations  net of proceeds of million arising from the exercise of stock options 
in december  we announced a fleet upgrade program to replace the dis fleet of mobile imaging systems over the next three years with our proprietary triple head digital mobile gamma camera 
we estimate that the cost of this plan will be approximately to million  which we expect to fund from existing cash resources 

table of contents debt service as of december   we had capital lease obligations totaling million 
these obligations are secured by the specific equipment financed under each lease and will be repaid monthly over the lease terms  which range from to months 
our dis subsidiary entered into the majority of these capital lease obligations 
we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s opinion  very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that are most subject to important estimates or assumptions include those described below 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from providing in office services to support the performance of nuclear imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
when all of the following four criteria are met a contract or sales arrangement exists  products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our dis revenue is recorded once the services and disposables are provided and consumed  which is normally on the day of the service 
for our product revenue  these criteria are usually met upon delivery 
reductions to our dis revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments 
reductions to product revenue are recorded to provide for payment adjustments and credit memos and historically have not been significant 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments historically  the need to estimate reserves for accounts receivable has been limited to our dis business 
we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
dis payment adjustments and credit memos are adjustments for billing errors that are normally adjusted within the first days subsequent to the performance of service  with the majority occurring within the first days 
reserves are provided as a percentage of dis revenue based on our historical experience rate 
we use a combination of factors in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
each account is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis and a percentage varying from zero to for each account is established 
we do not establish reserves for accounts with a history of payment 
table of contents without disputes 
we generally reserve between and of the outstanding balance for accounts that are more than days late and or under dispute 
we reserve of the outstanding balance for accounts that we believe constitute a high risk of default based on factors such as level of dispute  payment history and our knowledge of a customer s inability to meet its obligations 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectibility could be impacted by material amounts by changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
the provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
long lived assets we state property and equipment and purchased contracts at cost 
we capitalize betterments  which extend the useful life of the equipment 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment and purchased contracts on the straight line method over the estimated useful live three to seven years for property and equipment of the assets 
we follow financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  we measure the impairment be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we undertook an assessment of our dis camera fleet to determine whether and when to deploy newer and more technically advanced models 
based on our assessment  we established a program to replace our existing camera fleet in its entirety over the next three years and we also concluded that we should reduce the depreciable life of our dis cameras from seven to five years 
in prior years  we have taken impairment charges on certain customer contracts purchased during from nuclear imaging systems  inc and florida cardiology  inc assets are examined for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that may indicate a potential asset impairment 
inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances quarterly for excess or obsolete inventory levels 
except where firm orders are on hand  we consider inventory quantities in excess of the next months demand as excess and reserve for them at of cost  depending on our knowledge and forecast for the product 
we establish obsolescence reserves at for obsolete products 
we review the reserve quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
once the inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
warranty we provide a warranty on certain of our products and accrue the estimated cost at the time revenue is recorded 
historically  the warranty periods have ranged from months up to months 
since july  substantially all of the warranty periods have been months before customer sponsored maintenance begins 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of units at customers covered by warranty 
we review warranty reserves monthly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the return on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in

a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
