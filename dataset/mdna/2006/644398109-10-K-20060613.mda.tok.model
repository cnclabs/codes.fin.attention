item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in part iv  item of notes to consolidated financial statements  of this form k  which information is incorporated by reference into this part i  item pay tv group industry overview new frontier media  through its wholly owned subsidiary ten also referred to as pay tv group  is focused on the distribution of adult entertainment programming through electronic distribution platforms including cable television  dbs  hotels and c band 
adult entertainment content distribution has evolved over the past twenty five years from home video platforms video cassette to cable television systems and dbs providers  and most recently to the internet and mobile phones 
cable television operators began offering subscription and ppv adult programming from network providers such as playboy enterprises  inc playboy in the early s 
conditional access technology enables cable television operators or satellite providers to sell content as ppv ie  individual movie  a timed block of programming  or as an event for a set fee 
in addition  it also permits cable television operators or satellite providers to sell the pay tv group s programming on a monthly  quarterly  semiannual and annual basis 
ppv and vod programming competes well with other forms of entertainment because of its relatively low price point 
kagan research  llc kagan  a leader in media research  estimates that adult ppv and vod revenue generated by cable systems and dbs providers in was million most recent data available 
as the number of cable operators which offer adult content increases and distributors continue to expand their offerings  kagan projects revenues from the adult category will grow to billion by the year ppv programming is delivered through any number of delivery methods  including a cable television  b dth to households with large satellite dishes receiving a low power analog or digital signal c band or dbs services such as those currently offered by echostar communications corporation and directv group  inc  c wireless cable systems  and d low speed dial up or broadband internet connections ie  streaming video 
the pay tv group provides programming on both a ppv and subscription basis to home satellite dish viewers through large backyard satellite dishes receiving a low power analog or digital signal c band 
according to general instrument corporation s gi access control center reports  the us c band market has declined year over year  from  households as of april to  as of april the pay tv group also provides ppv and subscription programming to small dish viewers receiving a high power digital signal via dbs providers such as echostar communications corporation s dish network 
as of march   echostar communications corporation dish and directv group  inc direct tv had million and million subscribers  respectively  according to public filings made by each company 
kagan estimates that the number of dbs subscribers will grow to million by the year in addition  the pay tv group provides its programming on a ppv  subscription and vod basis through large multiple system operators msos and their affiliated cable systems  as well as independent  privately held cable systems 
as of april  the pay tv group maintained distribution arrangements with nine of the ten largest domestic cable msos that control access to million  or  of the total basic cable household market 
according to the national cable and telecommunications association ncta  cable msos delivered service to million basic households in the united states as of december the most recent statistics available 
in addition  kagan indicates that as of december  total analog and digital addressable cable service ie  basic cable households that have the capability of receiving ppv or subscription services was provided to million households 
growth in the ppv market is expected to result in part from cable system upgrades utilizing fiber optic  digital compression technologies or other bandwidth expansion methods that provide cable operators additional channel capacity 
cable operators have shifted from analog to digital technology in order to upgrade their cable systems and to respond to competition from dbs providers who offer programming in a digital environment 
when implemented  digital compression technology increases channel capacity  improves audio and video quality  provides fully secure scrambled signals  allows for advanced set top boxes for increased interactivity  and provides for integrated electronic programming guides epg 
the pay tv group expects that all of its future cable launches will be on a digital platform 
according to the ncta  as of december  over of us cable customers  or approximately million households  received digital cable service 
this represents an increase of over the number of digital subscribers receiving service at the end of million 
kagan estimates that the number of digital cable subscribers will grow to million by the year  which will represent a digital penetration rate 
cable operators are also using their upgraded plants to provide their digital customers with vod services due to technology constraints  dbs providers are not currently able to provide vod service to their customers  however  dbs providers are expect to launch new technologies that will facilitate vod in the future 
vod is a more advanced form of pay per view service which provides a digital video subscriber with the ability to watch movies  tv shows  infomercials  and other content on demand with full vcr functionality  in contrast to watching programs at preset times 
the pay tv group currently provides programming to over million vod enabled households

ten family of networks programming strategy the ten family of networks is designed to be offered together as one cohesive programming package 
the counter programming strategy employed between each of the seven ppv networks and vod service is designed to provide the widest variety of content to the consumer while at the same time supporting an efficient use of ten s vast content library 
premiere titles are programmed on vod first and then are made available through the ppv networks 
because ten does not duplicate titles across its ppv channels or between ppv and vod in a single month  ten is able to give its consumers access to more unique titles  a wider variety of talent  and a greater variety of studio representation than any of its competitors 
ten focuses on prime time viewing blocks and programs specific types of content in those blocks to create an appointment viewing calendar with the intent of driving viewers to traditionally less popular nights of the week for viewing adult content 
all networks are counter programmed to one another  creating an even greater level of variety for the consumer with multiple channels 
ultimately  this strategy is responsible for the fact that ten has services per unique addressable home

the pay tv group brands its services to the consumer under the ten name and logo 
the pay tv group seeks out low cost  high impact ways to reach its consumer audience and build brand recognition 
competition the pay tv group principally competes with playboy in the subscription  ppv and vod markets 
playboy has a longer operating history and broader name recognition than the pay tv group 
playboy s size and market position makes it a more formidable competitor than if it did not have the resources and name recognition that it has 
the pay tv group competes directly with playboy with respect to the editing standards of its programming  network performance in terms of subscriber buy rates  and the license fees that the pay tv group offers to cable operators and dbs providers 
however  the pay tv group cannot and does not compete with playboy in the amount of money spent on programming and promoting its products 
other competitors such as hustler and playgirl have recently entered the vod market 
while there can be no assurance that the pay tv group will be able to maintain its current distribution and fee structures in the face of competition from playboy or any other content provider  the pay tv group believes that the quality and variety of its programming  and its ability to generate higher buy rates for its programming  are the critical factors which have influenced cable operators and dbs providers to choose the pay tv group s programming over its competition 
the pay tv group also faces general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other television networks  feature films  and other programming 
in addition  the pay tv group faces competition in the adult entertainment arena from other providers of adult programming including producers of adult content  adult video dvd rentals and sales  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  telephone adult chat lines  adult oriented internet services and adult oriented wireless services 
internet group industry overview according to pew internet american life pew  a non profit entity whose initiative is the timely information on the internet s growth and societal impact  of american adults are internet users about million  and or million american adults have high speed connections in the home 
according to ncta  the us cable industry served approximately million high speed internet customers as of december  up from million high speed internet customers as of december  an increase of year over year 
additionally  comscore networks  a global information provider and consultant  found that million people fifteen years old and older used the internet worldwide in march  representing of the world s total population within this age group 
asian countries  including china  japan  india and korea  represented of the total worldwide online population or million users 
in anticipation of the continued increase in broadband users  during the fiscal year ended march  the internet group shifted its focus from the dial up web surfer to creating an award winning website targeted specifically to the broadband consumer 
this site  ten 
com  features over  hours of video content  over  photos  live chat  and voyeur cams 
ten 
com is offered to consumers on a monthly subscription basis for or a three month subscription for 
traffic to ten 
com is derived from advertising on the pay tv group s networks 
in addition  a targeted network of affiliated adult webmasters directs traffic to ten 
com and is compensated only if the traffic converts into a paying member to ten 
com 
monthly subscription revenue declined during the fiscal year ended march   as the internet group was not attracting enough new traffic to ten 
com to offset the churn of its recurring membership base 
the internet group also sells ten 
com through revenue sharing partnerships with third party gatekeepers 
the internet group executed its first such revenue sharing agreement with on command during the fiscal year ended march  under the terms of the agreement  the internet group is the exclusive provider of adult content for on command s tv internet service 
the internet group is providing a customized version of its ten 
com broadband product for delivery through on command s tv internet service in its hotel rooms nationwide 
during the fiscal year  the internet group began to focus on the development of a wireless product for distribution both domestically and internationally 
an october report by the yankee group  a research and consulting firm  forecasts that the mobile adult content market in the us could reach billion by this estimate assumes that adult content providers can use the carriers billing systems easily and that consumers can easily sign up for and use these services 
a report by strategy analytics  an independent global research and consulting firm  forecasts that the mobile adult services market is set to reach billion worldwide by growth in the us market will initially be limited because wireless operators are reluctant to offer explicit content for fear of regulatory or consumer backlash 
an october report by gartner  the largest information technology research and advisory company  states that us carriers are only offering pg rated content 
the report further states that the cellular telecommunications internet association ctia is currently working on a content rating system 
the two biggest issues which must be solved for us carriers to be comfortable offering more explicit content on the handset are how to prevent minors from viewing adult content and what content should be restricted 
the solutions will most likely require an opt in measure so that adults can verify they are over years old 
the internet group is currently working with ctia to develop age verification standards  and it believes that its long history and experience in compliance will be an asset in the wireless market 
wireless customers in the us will still be able to access this content by browsing wireless internet sites  such as the one that the internet group has developed 
according to the ctia the number of us wireless subscribers as of december has increased since to approximately million  and worldwide subscribers have topped billion 
according to the october gartner report  the cultural acceptance of adult content is higher in europe 
for example  sfr in france reports that of the searches on its portal are for adult content while the figure is for vodafone uk 
in asia  however  only a handful of operators distribute adult content as part of their mobile content offering 
countries like malaysia  indonesia  and singapore do not offer adult content  but they also do not prevent their subscribers from accessing sites by manually keying in the url or via search engines 
the market for mobile content is continuously evolving 
the internet group believes that the always on capability of the phone will drive the market for mobile content 
in addition  improvements in user interfaces to make it easier to get content  making it more intuitive and more like that of the internet  making it simpler to purchase content with less button clicks  and the capability to purchase from a variety of vendors will increase the revenue for this market 
further  the continued rollout of third generation g mobile phones will also drive the market for video mobile content 
the internet group currently has agreements with third party aggregators such as mobix interactive  mobile bv  and fone starz to distribute its content on a revenue sharing basis to their distribution partners such as orange  o  and vodaphone 
currently  the internet group s content is available to million mobile phone users  including million in the us revenue from the internet group s mobile products is minimal at this time due its limited content offering 
during the fiscal year  the internet group was successful in implementing its own wireless platform through which it can distribute its own content or the content of other providers 
this wireless platform will enable the internet group to bypass the third party aggregators and go directly to the wireless carriers for distribution of its wireless product 
by going directly to the wireless carriers the internet group expects to increase the amount of the revenue that it is retaining  be more in control of the distribution of its product  obtain better placement of its product on the carrier deck  and obtain more timely reporting of the performance of its products 
the internet group currently faces the following challenges in providing its content to the mobile industry us carriers hesitancy to launch adult content lack of age verification technology in the us poor user interfaces resulting in poor consumer experience a lack of appropriately edited content for this space most content requested by mobile carriers has a less explicit editing standard than the pay tv group s pleasure network lack of timely and effective data on consumer buying habits lag time in revenue collection most companies remit on a quarterly basis multiple markets impedes scalability content localization issues difficulty in viewing the internet group s content and that of its competitors given the multiple carriers in multiple locations multiple  branded competitors worldwide with very few barriers to entry however  the internet group continues to believe that this market can  and will be  profitable within months given the following opportunities the size of the us adult mobile market is expected to be billion by and billion worldwide by the us wireless market is very similar to the pay tv group s business where the industry will be controlled by a small number of large companies who want to participate in adult revenue by partnering with a trusted provider carriers will need a way to achieve a return on their investment into g network upgrades the internet group has already developed a wireless platform  which will allow it to partner directly with the wireless carriers and by pass third party aggregators 
in addition  for a share of the revenue  the internet group can allow other content providers to distribute content via its platform 
our expectation of limited competition in the us market existing customer base of million television households of the pay tv group to aggressively market the internet group s wap site  sms campaigns  and other adult mobile content products ability to create unique and compelling content for wireless products description of internet revenue streams business to consumer ten 
com the internet group offers ten 
com to consumers on a recurring monthly subscription basis for or for three months at 
the site is targeted to adult broadband consumers and provides access to over  hours of video content 
the internet group generates traffic to its web sites through two primary sources 
the first  type in traffic  is generated when a consumer types the name of the internet group s web site into their browser address bar 
there is no cost to the internet group when traffic comes to its web site in this manner 
currently  the internet group actively markets its ten 
com web site on the pay tv group s networks in order to drive type in traffic to its site 
approximately of the internet group s traffic is currently generated from advertising on the pay tv group s networks or through type in traffic 
the second way in which the internet group generates traffic is through its affiliate marketing programs utilizing banner ads  hypertext  or graphic links 
the marketing programs compensate an affiliated webmaster for a referred visitor if the visitor becomes a member to ten 
com 
the affiliated webmaster programs currently pay out an amount equal to of the first month s membership revenue for a new member 
the internet group then keeps of the revenue from each recurring monthly membership 
during the past few years  the internet group has decreased its reliance on affiliated webmaster programs as a way to generate traffic to its sites 
business to business content the internet and pay tv groups have licensed thousands of hours of adult video content and over  still images from various adult studios  all of which have been organized thematically and  if necessary  digitized for internet distribution 
the internet group  in addition to using this content within its own web site  sublicenses this content to webmasters through its business to business programs on a monthly flat rate or bandwidth usage basis 
marketing the internet group currently generates approximately of its traffic to ten 
com from advertising its site on the pay tv group s networks and through type in traffic 
the internet group has a small group of affiliated webmasters that send traffic to ten 
com and are compensated if the traffic converts into a paying member 
the affiliate webmaster programs currently pay out an amount equal to of the first month s membership revenue for a new member 
the internet group then keeps of the revenue from each recurring monthly membership 
data center the internet group had its own data center in sherman oaks  california that provided for all of its web farm  hosting and co location needs 
the data center occupied approximately  square feet 
the internet group moved its data center to boulder  colorado in january where it has been integrated with the pay tv group s digital broadcast facility 
this move allowed the internet group to significantly reduce its data center costs 
integrating the data center with the broadcast facility enables the company to more efficiently leverage its content across multiple platforms 
the data center uses leading networking hardware  high end web and database servers  and computer software to effectively address the internet group s diverse systems and network integration needs 
e commerce billing historically  credit card purchases  primarily through visa and mastercard  have been face to face paper transactions 
this has evolved into face to face swipe transactions with the advent of point of sale terminals and a magnetic stripe on the back of the card storing the cardholder s information 
the credit card system  however  was never designed for non face to face transactions such as those that occur on the internet 
because the credit card system was not designed for non face to face transactions  it is understandable that most fraud originates in this area 
the credit card networks were not engineered to verify a valid card in a card not present environment such as the internet 
the card associations  instead of investing in modifications of its legacy networks necessary to operate in this changing environment  have combated fraud in card not present environments by charging high chargeback fees and penalties to merchants and banks 
in the past few years the number of banking relationships available for merchant banking has dropped  the cost of chargebacks has increased  and the acceptable level allowed for chargeback rates has also been dramatically reduced 
the internet group currently utilizes one credit card company to process its membership revenue from ten 
com and maintains chargeback and credit ratios that are well below the requirement 
competition the adult internet industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented given the relatively low barriers to entry 
the leading adult internet companies are constantly vying for more members while also seeking to hold down member acquisition costs paid to webmasters 
the internet group believes that the primary competitive factors in the adult internet industry include the quality of content  technology  pricing  and sales and marketing efforts 
although the internet group no longer actively competes for traffic with its primary internet competitors  the group believes that it has a distinct competitive advantage in forming third party gatekeeper arrangements for the distribution of ten 
com since it already has many of the same relationships through the pay tv group s contracts

risk factors this report on form k contains forward looking statements 
you can identify forward looking statements by their use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  likely  believe  intend  expect  or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations  or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
when considering the forward looking statements made in this report  you should consider the risks set forth below and other cautionary statements throughout this report 
you should also keep in mind that all forward looking statements are based on management s existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management s control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect 
if one or more risks identified in this report or other filing materializes  or any other underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  projected  or intended 
the loss of any of our current major customers  dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation  would have a material adverse affect on our operating performance and financial condition 
dish network  one of the leading providers of direct broadcast satellite services in the united states  time warner cable and comcast corporation  are major customers of our pay tv group 
the loss of any of dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation as customers would have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
we are currently negotiating a contract with dish network 
as a result of these negotiations  we expect that our license fees will be reduced and that  as a result  our revenue will be negatively impacted 
for our fiscal year ended march   our revenues from dish network  time warner cable  and comcast corporation were approximately   and  respectively  of our total company wide revenues 
dish network is not contractually required to carry our programming and can cancel its broadcast of our programming at any time 
failure to maintain our agreements with cable msos on favorable terms could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we currently have agreements with the nation s five largest cable msos 
our agreements with these operators may be terminated on short notice without penalty 
if one or more cable msos terminates or does not renew our agreements  or does not renew the agreement on terms as favorable as those of our current agreements  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
failure to meet our performance guarantee with direct tv could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we recently entered into a two year agreement with direct tv for the distribution of two of our networks 
this agreement requires us to meet certain performance targets connected with our replacement of competitive services 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these performance targets  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limits to our access to distribution channels could cause us to lose subscriber revenues and adversely affect our operating performance 
our satellite uplink provider s services are critical to us 
if our satellite uplink provider fails to provide the contracted uplinking services  our satellite programming operations would in all likelihood be suspended  resulting in a loss of substantial revenue to the company 
if our satellite uplink provider improperly manages its uplink facilities  we could experience signal disruptions and other quality problems that  if not immediately addressed  could cause us to lose subscribers and subscriber revenues 
our continued access to satellite transponders is critical to us 
our satellite programming operations require continued access to satellite transponders to transmit programming to our subscribers 
we also use satellite transponders to transmit programming to cable operators and dbs providers 
material limitations to satellite transponder capacity could materially adversely affect our operating performance 
access to transponders may be restricted or denied if we or the satellite owner is indicted or otherwise charged as a defendant in a criminal proceeding  the fcc issues an order initiating a proceeding to revoke the satellite owner s authorization to operate the satellite  the satellite owner is ordered by a court or governmental authority to deny us access to the transponder  we are deemed by a governmental authority to have violated any obscenity law  or our satellite transponder provider determines that the content of our programming is harmful to its name or business 
in addition to the above  the access of our networks to transponders may be restricted or denied if a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions 
our ability to convince cable operators and dbs providers to carry our programming is critical to us 
the primary way for us to expand our subscriber base is to convince additional cable operators and dbs providers to carry our programming 
we can give no assurance  however  that our efforts to increase our base of subscribers will be successful 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our primary cable dbs competitor  who has significantly greater resources than us  we will not be able to increase subscriber revenues 
our ability to increase subscriber revenues and operate profitably is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with playboy  our principal competitor 
playboy has significantly greater financial  sales  marketing and other resources to devote to the development  promotion and sale of its cable programming products  as well as a longer operating history and broader name recognition  than we do 
we compete with playboy as to the editing standards of its programming  network performance in terms of subscriber buy rates  and the license fees that we offer to cable operators and dbs providers 
if we are unable to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment  we will also not be able to increase subscriber revenue 
our ability to increase revenue is also related to our ability to compete effectively with other forms of adult and non adult entertainment 
we face competition in the adult entertainment industry from other providers of adult programming  adult video rentals and sales  books and magazines aimed at adult consumers  adult oriented telephone chat lines  adult oriented internet services  and adult oriented wireless services 
to a lesser extent  we also face general competition from other forms of non adult entertainment  including sporting and cultural events  other premium pay services  other television networks  feature films and other programming 
our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the quality and appeal of our competitors content  the strength of our competitors brands  the technology utilized by our competitors  the effectiveness of their sales and marketing efforts and the attractiveness of their product offerings 
our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  as well as better name recognition than we do 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their product offerings 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive technology research and development  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their content 
additionally  increased competition could result in price reductions  lower margins and negatively impact our financial results 
the continued addition of new competitors to the video on demand distribution platform will likely have a material adverse affect on our operating performance 
revenue from our pay tv group s video on demand service became a significant part of our overall revenue mix during our fiscal year ended march  the continued addition of new competitors to the vod platform  either on platforms where we have previously enjoyed exclusivity or where we currently share the platform  may continue to have an adverse affect on our operating performance 
we face competition on the vod platform from established adult video producers with postproduction capabilities  as well as independent companies that distribute adult entertainment 
these competitors may include producers such as hustler  penthouse  wicked pictures  and playgirl 
in the event that cable companies seek to purchase adult video content for their vod service directly from adult video producers or other independent distributors of such content our vod business is likely to suffer 
for the fiscal year ended march   revenue from our vod service was of our total pay tv revenue 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
because of the adult oriented content of our web site  we may be subject to obscenity or other legal claims by third parties 
we may also be subject to claims based upon the content that is available on our web site through links to other sites 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were found liable for this content 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure to this liability may require us to take steps that would substantially limit the attractiveness of our web site and or its availability in various geographic areas  which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue 
furthermore  our insurance may not adequately protect us against all of these types of claims 
increased government regulation in the united states and abroad could impede our ability to deliver our content and expand our business 
new laws or regulations  or the new application of existing laws could prevent us from making our content available in various jurisdictions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
these new laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  taxation  user privacy and other matters relating to our products and services 
moreover  the application to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  pornography  obscenity  libel  employment and personal privacy is still developing 
cable system and dbs operators could become subject to new governmental regulations that could further restrict their ability to broadcast our programming 
if new regulations make it more difficult for cable and dbs operators to broadcast our programming  our operating performance would be adversely affected 
the current administration in washington dc could result in increased government regulation of our business 
it is not possible for us to predict what new governmental regulations we may be subject to in the future 
continued imposition of tighter processing restrictions by the various credit card associations and acquiring banks would make it more difficult to generate revenues from our website 
our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment for our products and services is critical to us 
unlike a merchant handling a sales transaction in a card present environment  the e commerce merchant is responsible for all fraud perpetrated against them 
our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment for our products and services has been or could further be restricted or denied for a number of reasons  including but not limited to if we experience excessive chargebacks and or credits  if we experience excessive fraud ratios  if there is a change in policy of the acquiring banks and or card associations with respect to the processing of credit card charges for adult related content  continued tightening of credit card association chargeback regulations in international areas of commerce  association requirements for new technologies that consumers are less likely to use  an increasing number of european and us banks will not take accounts with adult related content in this regard we note that american express has a policy of not processing credit card charges for online adult related content 
to the extent other credit card processing companies were to implement a similar policy it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
the internet group utilizes one company to process credit cards for its membership website 
if this credit card company were to experience liquidity issues or become unable to process our monthly credit card transactions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
the loss of any of the film production group s major customers  directv  indemand  showtime  cinemax  lionsgate  universal music group or new line cinema  could have a material adverse effect on its operating performance and financial condition 
directv  indemand  showtime  cinemax  lionsgate  universal music group and new line cinema are key customers of the film production group 
the loss of any of directv  indemand  showtime  cinemax  lionsgate  universal or new line cinema could have a material adverse effect on the film production group s business operations and financial condition 
historically  the film production group has been responsible for of the total annual erotic content purchases made by cinemax and of the total annual erotic content purchases made by showtime 
neither directv  indemand  showtime  cinemax  lionsgate  universal music group nor new line cinema is contractually obligated to carry or purchase the film production group s programming 
if the film production group produces or acquires film content that is not well received by its customers  it may not be able to re coup the investment it has made in the film 
the film production group s ability to continue to create or acquire film content that is well received by its customers is critical to its future success 
if a film produced or otherwise acquired by the film production group does not sell as well as anticipated  the film production group may not be able to re coup its investment in the film  including  but not limited to  the cost of producing or acquiring the film and the costs associated with promoting the film 
historically  the average annual investment by the film production group in its films has ranged from million to million 
no assurance can be given that the film production group s past success in generating profits from its investment in its films will continue 
if we are not able to retain our key executives it will be more difficult for us to manage our operations and our operating performance could be adversely affected 
as a small company with approximately employees  our success depends upon the contributions of our executive officers and our other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a significant adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we cannot assure that new frontier media will be successful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
the three executive officers contracts end on march  if the three executive officers leave the company  it may have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
it may also be more difficult for us to attract and recruit new personnel due to the nature of our business 
our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
we are engaged in a business that has experienced tremendous technological change over the past several years 
as a result  we face all the risks inherent in businesses that are subject to rapid technological advancement  such as the possibility that a technology that we have invested in may become obsolete 
in that event  we may be required to invest in new technology 
our inability to identify  fund the investment in  and commercially exploit such new technology could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our ability to implement our business plan and to achieve the results projected by management will be dependent upon management s ability to predict technological advances and implement strategies to take advantage of such changes 
negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by opponents of adult content could adversely affect our operating performance and discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
we could become a target of negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts by one or more advocacy groups who oppose the distribution of adult entertainment 
these groups have mounted negative publicity campaigns  filed lawsuits and encouraged boycotts against companies whose businesses involve adult entertainment 
the costs of defending against any such negative publicity  lawsuits or boycotts could be significant  could hurt our finances and could discourage investors from investing in our publicly traded securities 
to date  we have not been a target of any of these advocacy groups 
as a leading provider of adult entertainment  we cannot assure you that we may not become a target in the future 
because we are involved in the adult programming business  it may be more difficult for us to raise money or attract market support for our stock 
some investors  investment banking entities  market makers  lenders and others in the investment community may decide not to provide financing to us  or to participate in our public market or other activities due to the nature of our business  which  in turn  may hurt the value of our stock  and our ability to attract market support

our business we operate our company in three segments pay tv  internet and film production 
we acquired the film production segment during the fourth quarter of our current fiscal year 
this segment engages in the production and distribution of mainstream films and soft  erotic features and events 
its library is distributed on us premium pay tv channels such as showtime networks  inc showtime and cinemax  as well as on pay per view channels across a range of cable and satellite distribution platforms 
the film production segment also distributes a full range of independently produced motion pictures to markets around the world and acts as a line producer for one mainstream movie a year for a major studio 
we acquired the film production segment to expand our portfolio to the rapidly growing market for less explicit  erotic content  which resides in more mainstream areas within the multi channel operators program guide  as well as to the growing market for event type content 
the acquisition also provides established relationships in international markets and provides access to a library of content that we own and that can be monetized through current distribution networks 
as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment  we use the following core competencies leveraging our technical infrastructure we own and operate a broadcast origination facility where our licensed content is a ingested at one central point and converted into multiple digital formats that allow for broadcast  vod  internet and wireless delivery  b tagged with meta data that allows for efficient cataloging of the elements included in the movie  c edited into the proper formats required by our customers ie  most edited  partially edited  and least edited  and d subjected to several rigorous quality control reviews prior to airing on any platform 
by owning and operating our own technical infrastructure  including our proprietary media asset management software tool  we are able to quickly respond to new revenue opportunities with zero to very little capital outlay 
for example  over the years  we have worked closely with many cable msos in understanding and perfecting the delivery of vod content  allowing us to become the leader in the delivery of vod content in the adult category 
we have been able to easily capitalize on new opportunities for delivering our content to the hotel industry due to our technical infrastructure 
we responded to the demand for new partially edited ppv services by launching two new networks in only days at very little additional cost 
we believe that our technical infrastructure will allow us to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities in the cable  satellite  broadband  hotel  wireless  and international markets  as well as any new platforms that may be discovered 
content library through our pay tv segment  we license content from a network of over forty five different adult studios  allowing us access to a wider variety of directors  actors and actresses  and content niches than our primary competitor 
we are committed to providing our consumers with variety  breadth and depth of content in order to appeal to the widest audience base possible 
we understand that our content is purchased in an impulse environment and that in order to capture those purchases we must provide a large amount of compelling  unique content to the consumer 
we use our extensive library to program our ppv networks  vod product  internet website  and wireless product 
content is used continuously through the life of the license term and will be repurposed in many ways  including using clips of the content and creating compilations or blocks of programming from several movies 
we spend approximately million annually licensing content for our ppv  vod  internet and wireless products 
we acquired the film library of our film production segment as part of the acquisition of this segment during the fourth quarter of our current fiscal year 
this library  which consists of titles that were produced by and are owned by the film production group  includes hours of soft  erotic feature movies and event style content 
we intend to monetize this library by distributing it through new platforms such as wireless  vod  direct to consumer dvd sales  as well as by leveraging our current relationships with on command  dish network  and other cable msos 
in addition  we believe that we can monetize this content for vod distribution internationally  where the editing standard is softer than that of the us pay television market 
we expect to create of hours of new content with a million production budget during the fiscal year 
expertise in creation  aggregation and editing of adult content we consider ourselves to be experts in the creation  aggregation and editing of high quality adult content 
we ensure that we have all proper documentation required to verify that the cast members of the movies that we produce or license are eighteen years or older 
all of our content is in strict compliance with usc we have developed processes and procedures to edit our content into various predetermined standards and censor that content for community standards 
we believe that the value we provide to our distribution partners lies in our insuring the existence of all age verification documents and appropriate content censorship in order to protect the brand equity of our distribution partners 
our pay tv segment monitor the trends in the video sales and rental market to understand what content niches are popular and we program our networks to correspond to these trends 
our pay tv segment monitors the trends of the vod buys of our own content to understand what type of content is selling the best and we adjust our programming models for these trends 
we understand how to create compelling vod content packages for our customers to launch on their systems  including ten latinas  ten hunks  ten real  quick n nasty  and double features 
we strive to provide the best performing ppv networks and vod service to the cable dbs hotel markets and the best performing soft  erotic content to our distribution partners 
we program seven ppv networks in order to accommodate different editing standards and different programming niches to best serve our customers needs 
we also ensure that the interstitial programming that we create for our ppv networks is entertaining  edgy  and appeals to our consumer audience 
reliable cash flows we consider our ability to generate reliable  recurring cash flows from operations to reinvest in our business to be a strength of our business 
we are able to reinvest these cash flows into capital expenditures to ensure that we are operating at maximum efficiency  that our broadcast operations are fully redundant  that our increasing storage needs are met  and that we are able to rapidly respond to changing technology requirements or platforms through which to distribute our products 
in addition  we are able to reinvest our cash flows into producing and acquiring compelling  unique  quality content for our products 
we also believe that our ability to generate reliable  recurring cash flows  as well as our current cash balances  will help us with the challenges of increasing competition in the vod market and with any regulatory issues that may arise from the current conservative administration 
our people we consider our employees to be a key driver to our business 
we are fortunate to be able to attract high quality marketing  branding  sales and technology employees who share our desire to use technology to make ourselves as efficient and effective as possible  who share our desire to build a worldwide recognizable brand  and who share our desire to obtain distribution on all electronic platforms willing to distribute adult content 
pay tv segment our pay tv segment is focused on the distribution of its seven ppv networks and its video on demand service to cable msos and dbs providers 
in addition  the pay tv group has had success in delivering its vod service to hotel rooms through its current distribution arrangements with on command and the hospitality network 
the pay tv group earns a percentage of revenue on each pay per view  subscription  or vod transaction related to its services 
revenue growth occurs as the pay tv group launches its services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experiences growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where its services are currently distributed on line growth  launches additional services to its existing cable dbs partners  experiences new and on line growth for its vod service  is able to effect increases in the retail price of its products  and is able to increase the buy rates for its products 
the pay tv group seeks to achieve distribution for at least four of its services on every digital platform in the us based on the current market of million dbs households and million digital cable households  the pay tv group currently has of its defined market share as of the year ended march  revenue growth for the pay tv group for the year ended march  was impacted by increased competition in the cable and hotel vod market increased vod distribution growth in our ppv revenue primarily attributable to new launches with cox communications  inc cox certain cable systems removing adult from their ppv platforms in an effort to transition customers to vod only revenue from the pay tv group s vod service became a significant part of its overall revenue mix during the fiscal year ended march   as cable operators upgraded their systems to deliver content in this manner 
the pay tv group currently delivers its vod content to million cable network households as compared to million a year ago  as well as to  hotel rooms through its distribution arrangement with on command as of march   as compared to  hotel rooms a year ago 
in addition  during the fiscal year we began to distribute our vod content to the hospitality network  which distributes content to  hotel rooms in several cities  including las vegas and atlantic city 
prior to our fiscal year  we were the sole provider of adult vod content to the two largest us cable msos 
during the third quarter of our fiscal year  our primary competitor in this market was added to the time warner cable time warner vod adult platform 
although our primary competitor was added to this platform  it did not negatively impact the number of hours of vod content that we provide to our time warner affiliates 
our vod revenue from time warner has declined year over year since our primary competitor was added to the platform 
we fully absorbed the impact of this revenue decline during the fiscal year  and we do not anticipate that any other competitors will be added to the time warner vod platform in the next months 
during our fiscal year  the largest cable mso in the us  comcast corporation comcast transitioned the editing standard on its vod platform from most edited to partially edited 
at the same time  comcast added adult content provided by two smaller competitors to its vod platform 
our revenue was not impacted by these changes and  in fact  we did experience an increase in vod revenue from comcast as a result of new launches with their affiliated systems during the fiscal year 
we anticipate that our primary competitor will be added to comcast s vod platform during our fiscal year 
at this time it is impossible for us to determine the impact  if any  that this will have on our revenue 
our vod revenue was favorably impacted during the fiscal year by growth in distribution of our vod product to affiliated systems of charter communications  inc charter and adelphia communications corporation adelphia 
we do anticipate that the addition of competition to vod platforms  a change in license fee structure for one mso  and a slowing in the growth of new vod subscribers may result in flat to declining vod revenues during the fiscal year 
the pay tv group s relationship with on command generated incremental vod revenue for the year ended march  however  revenue from on command declined during our and fiscal years 
the decline was a result of on command sourcing a portion of its content from our competitors instead of exclusively through us as well as to a decline in the number of hotel rooms to which on command is providing in room entertainment 
we continue to provide over of the content on the on command platform 
future growth from vod revenue generated through the hospitality industry is dependent upon the addition of new hotel properties by on command and an increase in business traveler occupancy rates 
we do not anticipate that our deal with hospitality network will result in a material increase in vod revenue from the hospitality industry 
our ppv revenue was flat year over year 
we did experience an increase in ppv revenue during the fiscal year from new launches with cox affiliated systems 
however  this increase in ppv revenue was offset by declines in revenue from two affiliated systems of time warner and charter that removed most of their adult content from their ppv platform in an effort to transition their customers to the vod platform 
however  this did not result in a revenue neutral transaction as many ppv customers are still not fully aware of vod and how to use it 
in fact  we were successful in re launching our ten blox network on time warner s manhattan system in an effort to recapture these buys 
we do not anticipate that other cable msos will remove adult entirely from their ppv platforms until vod becomes a more generally accepted manner by which to watch video content 
we believe this shift from ppv to vod will occur slowly over a three to six year period  in the same manner in which cable msos transitioned their consumer base from analog cable to digital cable 
we continue to launch our ppv services to cable msos  and we are anticipating new launches of our partially edited services during the fiscal year 
we do anticipate that revenue from our most edited service  pleasure  will continue to decline during the fiscal year as more cable msos transition to partially edited and least edited content 
we recently signed a two year agreement with direct tv for the distribution of two of our services 
these services launched in april we expect that these two services will generate approximately million in additional ppv revenue during our fiscal year 
we are currently negotiating a contract with dish for the continued distribution of three of our ppv networks 
we anticipate that this negotiation will result in a decline in our license fee structure  which will negatively impact our ppv revenue during the fiscal year 
at this time  we are unable to predict with any certainty when this contract will be completed and what the overall impact of the change in license fee structure will be 
we anticipate that our revenue could decline by as much as million annually as a result of this license fee reset 
to date  the focus of the pay tv group has been on the distribution of its ppv and vod services to cable  dbs and hotel platforms in the us market only 
we expect to begin exploring international markets such as canada  the uk  and europe during our fiscal year in an effort to expand our distribution 
in order to expand internationally  it will be necessary for us to acquire international rights to our content  which may result in higher content acquisition costs 
the pay tv group also provides its two least edited services to the c band market on a direct to the consumer basis 
c band customers contact the pay tv group s in house call center directly to purchase the networks on a one month or three month subscription basis 
the pay tv group retains of the revenue from these customers and over of the sales are made via credit cards 
this market has been declining for several years as these consumers convert from c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller  inch digital dbs satellite systems 
the pay tv group has been able to decrease its transponder  uplinking  marketing  and call center costs related to this business over the years in order to maintain its margins 
however  based on the rate of revenue decline and the expected erosion of its c band margins  the pay tv group expects that it will no longer be operating this business by the end of its fiscal year 
the pay tv group expects continued declines in revenue from this segment of its business during looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that could impact the pay tv group s future financial results including the following increased competition from other adult companies that may have better brand recognition increased pressure on license fees from our largest customer increased regulation of the adult industry increased competition attempting to acquire compelling adult content and changes to the flat fee structure by which we currently pay for content slowing growth of the overall adult ppv and vod category each of these challenges and risks has the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we believe that our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks 
we believe that many opportunities accompany these challenges and risks 
among these opportunities  we believe the following exist for the pay tv group future international distribution opportunities implementation of technologies that will allow for distribution of our content on new platforms such as ip vod and interactive content vod distribution through dish and direct tv acquisition and development of unique adult content continued increase in the number of digital customers able to view our ppv and vod content as cable operators transition analog customers to their digital platforms internet segment the internet group generates revenue by selling monthly memberships to its website  ten 
com  by earning a percentage of revenue from third party gatekeepers like on command for the distribution of ten 
com to their customer base  and by selling pre packaged video and photo content to webmasters for a monthly fee 
over of revenue from the internet group continues to be generated from monthly memberships to ten 
com 
however  we have seen this revenue erode over the past several years since the current traffic volume to ten 
com does not generate enough new monthly sign ups to offset the churn of our renewing membership base 
the decline in our membership revenue slowed during our and fiscal years as new marketing efforts increased traffic to ten 
com  generating monthly signups that were close to or slightly exceeding our monthly cancellation rate 
in addition  we increased the retail price for our website from to during the fiscal year 
we are working on implementing new pricing strategies to increase revenues generated by our website  including selling our searchable library of content on a pay per view and pay per minute basis and promotional pricing 
our website will also be redesigned during the fiscal year in an effort to increase the rate of conversion of traffic to the site into paying members 
additionally  we will be increasing our marketing efforts by advertising ten 
com through various search engines in order to reverse the recent revenue trends 
we have also seen a decrease in revenue generated from selling pre packaged content to webmasters during the past three fiscal years 
this decrease in revenue from the sale of content is due to a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
in addition  we have not allocated any significant resources towards a sales effort for these content products 
during the fiscal year  our internet group began to focus on the development of wireless products for distribution both domestically and internationally 
these wireless products include a wireless enabled web site wap site  photo and video content  and ring moans 
our content is sold direct to the consumer via our wap site 
our wap site is billed to the consumer via their cell phone bill by a third party payment processor who participates in the revenue that is generated 
in addition  we have revenue sharing agreements with third party aggregators such as mobix interactive  mobile bv  and fone starz that distribute our content to their distribution partners such as orange  o  and vodaphone 
currently  our content is available to million cell phone users  including million in the us revenue from our mobile products is minimal at this time due our limited content offering 
during the fiscal year  we were successful in implementing our own wireless platform through which we can distribute our content or the content of other providers 
this wireless platform will enable us to bypass the third party aggregators and go directly to the wireless carriers for distribution of our wireless product 
by going directly to the wireless carriers we will be able to increase the amount of the revenue that we are retaining  be more in control of the distribution of our product  obtain better placement of our product on the carrier deck  and obtain more timely reporting of the performance of our products 
currently  these third party aggregators remit reports and our revenue on a quarterly basis 
during the fiscal year  we will be focused on the following for our wireless products obtaining direct distribution with several wireless carriers whereby we can utilize our own wireless platform to deliver the content  creating the infrastructure necessary to create  market and deliver a full range of wireless products  creating and or acquiring unique content specifically for the wireless platform  including mobisodes and other short form content  which adheres to a less explicit editing standard than our pleasure network  creating sms marketing campaigns we expect that both our revenue and operating costs for wireless will increase during the fiscal year  but that we will continue to generate losses while we build this business 
we anticipate reaching break even for our wireless products during the fiscal year 
film production segment we acquired the film production segment during the fourth quarter of our current fiscal year 
this acquisition allows us to expand our portfolio to the rapidly growing market for less explicit  erotic content  as well as to the market for erotic  event type content 
this acquisition also provides established relationships in international markets  which we feel can assist the pay tv segment with its plans to expand internationally 
in addition  the acquisition provides access to a library of less explicit  erotic content that can be monetized through current distribution channels of our existing segments 
we derive our revenue from three principal businesses in this segment the production and distribution of original motion pictures known as erotic  thrillers and erotic  event styled content ie  owned product  the licensing of domestic third party films in international markets where we act as a sales agent for the product repped product  and the contract production of one motion picture per year for a third party distributor 
we create and produce soft  erotic thriller movies and original erotic series that are distributed in the us on premium movie services  such as cinemax and showtime  as well as internationally on similar services 
we also develop and produce original  event or reality styled programming that we sell on pay per view channels through cable and satellite tv systems across the united states primarily through our relationships with in demand  dish  and direct tv 
during the year we will produce hours of new content with an annual production budget of approximately million 
we use outside production companies to shoot the content while providing in house oversight of all critical areas such as scripting  casting  shoot location  and post production 
we generate revenue by licensing our content for a one time fee to premium tv services such as cinemax and showtime 
in addition  we license our erotic thrillers and adult event content to cable operators and satellite providers through our relationships with in demand  tvn  direct tv  and dish on a revenue share basis with license fees that are greater than those earned by the pay tv group due to the more mainstream nature of the content 
we also license our original content to international premium tv services primarily in europe and other countries 
international content rights are licensed for a period of time on a flat fee basis 
in addition  we generate revenue by establishing relationships with high quality  independent mainstream filmmakers to license the international rights to their movies under the lightning entertainment and mainline releasing labels 
most recently  we acquired the international distribution rights for junebug  winner of a special jury prize at the sundance film festival  walmart the high cost of low prices  and conversations with god 
we earn a commission of for licensing the international rights on behalf of these producers as well as a marketing fee 
each contract allows for the recoupment of costs that we may incur in preparing the title for market  including advertising costs  screening costs  costs to prepare the trailer  box art and screening material  and any costs necessary to ensure the movie is market ready 
additionally  we may obtain the domestic video rights for certain titles for which we will earn higher commissions than we do for the international licensing rights 
we have distribution agreements with lionsgate home entertainment  universal music group universal and new line cinema who will use these titles for direct to video release 
on average  we will license titles annually to these customers for home video use 
we earn our commission on any revenues remaining after lionsgate  universal and new line cinema recoup their commissions  marketing fee  and any hard costs incurred in preparing the content for market 
once a year we act as a contract film producer to one major hollywood studio 
most often the production involves the sequels to successful releases such as single white female where we produced single white female the production generally results in the delivery of the film in the third or fourth quarter of the fiscal 
at this time we are still negotiating with the studio for the fiscal year production and no assurance can be given as to the results of this negotiation 
we believe that we can increase our revenue in the following ways as a result of our integration with new frontier media s existing segments obtain distribution for our erotic thrillers with on command and hospitality network  distribute our content to wireless carriers by leveraging the internet segment s relationships in this area distribute our content to us and international cable vod platforms by leveraging the pay tv segment s relationships in this area develop reality  event content franchises by distributing our existing content direct to the consumer on dvd distribute our content through new media platforms such as itunes  real networks  and portals like msn or google increase distribution of our content with dish by leveraging the pay tv segment s relationship critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  goodwill impairment  prepaid distribution rights content licensing and our film library 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed with our audit committee the development  selection  and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues for the pay tv group are primarily related to the sale of our ppv and vod services to cable dbs and hotel affiliates 
the cable affiliates and dbs providers do not report actual monthly ppv or vod sales for each of their systems to the pay tv group until days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the pay tv group s historical experience for each affiliated system 
the pay tv group subsequently adjusts its revenue to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the cash 
historically  any differences between the amounts estimated and the actual amounts received have been immaterial due to the overall predictability of pay per view revenues 
given the evolution of the vod platform  the revenue expected from new vod cable affiliates can be more difficult to predict 
the pay tv group believes that it is conservative in estimating the impact of the rollout of vod households  and it continually adjusts estimates to reflect actual revenue remitted 
the recognition of revenues for the pay tv  internet  and film production groups is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
income tax expense and accruals our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time that we determine that it is probable that we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable 
such liabilities are recorded in the line item income taxes payable receivable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense  or additional paid in capital when appropriate  when the amounts involved become known 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
accounting for investments in debt and equity securities we hold investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  excluded from earnings and initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in income 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
we concluded for the   and fiscal years that the fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded the carrying values and no impairment charge was required 
if actual operating results or cash flows are different than our estimates and assumptions  we could be required to record impairment charges in future periods 
prepaid distribution rights content licensing and film costs our pay tv and internet group s film and content libraries consist of newly produced and historical film licensing agreements 
we account for the licenses in accordance with sfas financial accounting by broadcasters 
accordingly  we capitalize the costs associated with the licenses and certain editing costs and amortize the costs on a straight line basis over the life of the licensing agreement usually to years 
pursuant to sfas  the costs associated with the license agreements should be amortized in a manner that is consistent with expected revenues to be derived from such films 
we have determined that it is appropriate to amortize these costs on a straight line basis under the assertion that each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenues 
we regularly review and evaluate the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis and assess if an accelerated method would more appropriately reflect the revenue generation of the content 
through our analysis  we have concluded that the current policy of recognizing the costs incurred to license the film library on a straight line basis most accurately reflects the revenue generated by each film 
we periodically review our film library and assess if the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the films 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  we will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value of the film library to the fair market value 
our film production group capitalizes its share of direct film costs in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
capitalized costs of film and television product film costs  which are produced or acquired for sale or license  are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
film costs consist of direct production costs and production overhead and include costs associated with completed titles and those in development 
interest expense is not capitalized as the production runs are short term in nature 
film cost valuation is reviewed on a title by title basis when an event or change in circumstance indicates the fair value of a title is less than the unamortized cost 
estimated losses  if any  are provided in the current period earnings on an individual film forecast basis when such losses are estimated 
once a film is released  capitalized film production costs are amortized in the proportion that the revenue during the period for each film bears to the estimated ultimate revenues  for a period not exceeding ten years  to be received from all sources under the individual film forecast computation method as defined in sop estimates of ultimate revenues can change significantly due to a variety of factors  including the level of market acceptance of film and television product 
accordingly  revenue estimates are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted on a prospective basis  as necessary 
such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods 
results of operations pay tv group the following table outlines the current distribution environment and network households for each network and our vod service estimated network households in thousands network distribution method as of march  as of march  as of march  pleasure cable   ten cable dbs   ten clips cable dbs   video on demand cable  ten xtsy c band cable dbs  ten max c band cable ten blue cable   ten blox cable   total network households   ten xtsy and ten max addressable household numbers include million  million  and million c band addressable households for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the above table reflects network household distribution 
a household will be counted more than once if the home has access to more than one of the pay tv group s services  since each service represents an incremental revenue stream 
the pay tv group estimates its unique household distribution as of march   march  and march  to be million  million and million cable homes  respectively  and million  million and million dbs homes  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain financial information for the pay tv group for the three years ended march in millions year ended march percent change vs vs net revenue ppv cable dbs vod cable hotel c band total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income net revenue ppv cable dbs revenue to our cable dbs revenue was flat from to however  the mix of this revenue was impacted in the following manner we experienced a decline in revenue from the distribution of our four partially edited ppv networks through cable msos 
this decline is a result of the largest affiliated system of time warner cable time warner and several affiliated systems of charter communications  inc charter removing most of the adult content on their ppv platforms in an attempt to transition customers to their vod platform 
we do not anticipate that any other msos will remove adult content from their ppv platforms entirely during the next months 
in fact  we were successful in convincing the largest affiliated system of time warner to re launch our ten blox network during the fiscal year in order to recapture these lost buys 
this decline in revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue from new launches of our partially edited networks with cox communications  inc cox 
we signed a distribution agreement with cox in march and began to see initial launches with their affiliated systems in september launches with cox affiliated systems continued during the past twelve months resulting in an increase in revenue 
revenue from the pleasure network also declined as mso s continue to transition both their ppv and vod platforms to a partially edited standard 
the number of network households for pleasure declined to million as of march   from million as of march   representing a decrease of 
we expect to experience continued erosion of revenue from our pleasure network as the largest mso in the us completes the transition of the editing standard of its ppv platform from most edited to partially edited during our fiscal year  resulting in continued erosion of distribution for this network 
revenue from our three services distributed through dish network was flat from to revenue from advertising on our ppv networks  which represents less than of our total pay tv revenue  increased slightly from  offsetting the decline in revenue from our ppv networks 
ppv cable dbs revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s ppv revenues from to was attributable to the following items an increase in revenues generated by our three services on the dish platform a increase in cable ppv revenues from our partially edited services revenue from our ten  ten clips and ten xtsy networks on the dish platform increased year over year 
we attribute this to an increase in the number of subscribers to the dish platform as well as to certain changes that dish has made to the way it prices and packages its adult programming networks 
the increase in revenue from our partially edited services is related to the continued growing acceptance by our consumer base for our partially edited services  ten  ten blue  ten blox  and ten clips 
we view this as a positive development given the higher buy rates and higher retail rates associated with this editing standard 
the distribution of our four partially edited services increased to million network households as of march  from million network households as of march   representing an increase of 
approximately half of this increased distribution during our fiscal year can be attributed to our distribution agreement with cox 
at the same time that we are experiencing an increase in the distribution of our partially edited services  we are experiencing a decline in the distribution of our most edited service  pleasure  by certain msos 
revenue from our pleasure service declined year over year as one of our largest customers transitioned from distributing primarily pleasure in to primarily distributing our partially edited services in vod cable hotel revenue to the increase in our vod revenue is attributable to the following an increase in vod revenue due to increased distribution with several cable msos this increase in vod revenue from was partially offset by a decrease in vod revenue from the time warner vod platform as a result of competition being added to the platform during our fiscal year a decline in revenue from the distribution of our vod content via the hospitality industry during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  our largest competitor was added to the time warner vod platform 
previous to this  we had been the only provider of adult vod content for time warner and its affiliated systems 
we have experienced a decline in our year over year vod revenue from time warner as a result of the addition of this competitor to the platform 
the decline in revenue from the time warner vod platform was fully offset by an increase in revenue from new vod launches by charter  comcast corporation and adelphia communications corporation 
distribution for our vod product increased to million households as of march   from million as of march   representing a increase year over year 
revenue from our hotel vod service provided to on command corporation declined from due to on command adding content from other providers to their platform and due to a decline in the number of hotel rooms to which on command is providing in room entertainment 
we continue to provide approximately of the adult content to this platform 
vod cable hotel revenue to the increase in the pay tv group s vod revenue from to is attributable to the following an increase in the number of households to which ten on demand is available distribution for ten on demand increased to million households as of march  from million households as of march   representing an increase of 
much of the increase in this distribution was attributable to the largest cable mso in the us upgrading its affiliated systems to be vod capable 
until the third quarter of our current fiscal year  we were the exclusive provider of adult vod content to the time warner affiliated systems 
at that time  our largest competitor was added to the vod platform 
although competition has been added to the platform  we do continue to retain the largest share of vod content  providing over hours of vod content to the time warner systems 
revenue from our hotel vod service provided to on command declined from this decline was a result of on command adding content from our competitors during our fiscal year 
c band revenue the year over year decreases in c band revenue are due to the continued decline of the c band market as consumers convert c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller dbs satellite systems 
the total c band market declined from to and from to providing service to the c band market continues to be profitable for us  generating operating margins of approximately during the fiscal year 
we will continue to closely monitor this business and when margins erode to an unacceptable level we will discontinue providing our content on this platform 
we anticipate that we will no longer be providing our networks on the c band platform by the end of the fiscal year 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast facility  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisition and conforming costs  vod transport costs  amortization of content licenses  and c band call center costs 
the decrease in cost of sales from the fiscal year to the fiscal year is due to a a decline in our transponder costs  b a decline in our uplinking costs  c a decline in our vod transport costs and d a decline in depreciation and operating lease expense 
the decline in our transponder and uplinking costs is due to the renegotiation of our contracts for these services during the and fiscal years 
we do not anticipate any further material declines in these costs during the fiscal year 
the decline in our vod transport costs is related to the utilization of a new vendor for the transportation of our vod content to certain msos 
the decline in our depreciation and operating lease costs is due to our equipment reaching the end of its depreciable life and the completion of most of the remaining operating leases during the fiscal year 
the decrease in costs of sales from fiscal year to is due to a a decline in costs associated with our in house call center  b a decrease in our c band transponder costs  c a decrease in our uplinking costs  and d a decrease in our programming and editing costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in our vod transport costs 
our call center costs decreased year over year due to staff layoffs necessitated by declining call volume as the c band market continues to erode 
our c band transponder costs decreased year over year due to the termination of the transponder lease related to our ten blueplus network  which we ceased broadcasting during our fiscal year  as well as to the renegotiation of our existing analog transponders during our fiscal year 
our uplinking costs declined year over year due to the renegotiation of this contract with our current provider during our fiscal year 
our programming and editing costs decreased year over year because we were no longer outsourcing these services to a third party in fiscal our own in house programming and editing departments were able to perform these services at a much lower cost than the third party provider 
vod transport costs increased year over year in line with the increase in our vod distribution and the number of programming hours that we were providing to cable msos 
operating income operating income increased from to primarily as a result of an increase in our gross margins 
gross margins increased to from year over year 
gross profit increased by year over year due to an decrease in cost of sales  which more than offset the decline in revenue from operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to of revenue during our fiscal year from of revenue during our fiscal year 
overall  operating expense increased by year over year from the increase in operating expenses is related to an increase in trade show costs  marketing costs and employee salaries 
the increase in trade show costs is due to our exhibition at the national cable and television association industry show during the current fiscal year 
due to increased competition in the adult programming category  we felt that we needed an increased level of visibility at this trade show 
in past years  we had attended but not exhibited at this show 
we anticipate that we will continue to exhibit at this and other industry shows during the fiscal year 
marketing costs increased as we increased the number of co op marketing programs that we conducted at the local level with the affiliated systems of our cable msos 
the increase in payroll costs was necessary for us to remain competitive and to increase employee retention 
the increase in trade show  marketing and payroll costs was partially offset by a decline in operating lease costs  due to the term of the leases ending during the fiscal year  and a decrease in amortization expense 
operating income increased from to primarily as a result of an increase in our gross margins 
gross margins increased to from year over year due to a increase in revenue combined with a decrease in cost of sales 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined from of revenue during our fiscal year to of revenue during our fiscal year 
overall  operating expenses increased 
this increase in operating expenses is a result of an increase in our brand promotion costs 
during the fiscal year we incurred costs for several consumer outreach events to promote the ten brand and services 
in addition  we incurred increased costs for a brand marketing event at the major adult industry trade show held annually in january 
the increase in our brand promotion costs was partially offset by a decline in marketing costs associated with our c band barker channel  which we discontinued using during the first quarter of our fiscal year 
internet group the following table sets forth certain financial information for the internet group for the three years ended march in millions year ended march percent change vs vs net revenue net membership sale of content total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income net revenue the decline in net membership revenue from to and the decline in net membership revenue from to were a result of a decline in traffic to our web sites and a continued erosion of the sale of monthly memberships 
we do not actively market our websites and we participate in only a select number of affiliate webmaster traffic generating programs 
instead  we depend primarily upon our adult domain names and advertising on the pay tv group s networks to generate type in traffic for ten 
com 
during the fiscal year we implemented new pricing and marketing strategies that helped to slow the decline in our membership revenue 
during the fiscal year we increased our monthly membership price to from 
in addition  we now offer a three month membership for 
this price increase applies only to new members joining our site 
we believe that these new price points have helped to stabilize our revenue even as traffic to our site continues to decline 
the decrease in revenue from the sale of content during the past three fiscal years is a result of a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they do purchase 
we are experimenting with alternative billing methods for our content products  allowing webmasters to pay for content based on the amount of bandwidth utilized as opposed to a flat monthly fee 
we have also encoded our video library within a digital rights management package  which will allow us to provide our video library to webmasters on a pay per view and pay per minute basis 
to date  we have not generated any material revenue related to the distribution of our content to domestic or international wireless platforms 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of expenses associated with credit card processing  bandwidth costs  traffic acquisition costs  content costs  and depreciation of assets 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decrease in costs of sales from to is primarily related to a decrease in bandwidth costs  credit card processing costs  depreciation expense and traffic acquisition costs 
bandwidth costs declined as we continue to benefit from new contracts with lower per megabit costs 
credit card processing costs declined due to the year over year decline in our membership revenue 
depreciation costs declined as our equipment reached the end of its depreciable life 
traffic acquisition costs declined due to less traffic being sent to our website that resulted in a paying membership to us 
the decline in these costs was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the development of our wireless products 
the decrease in cost of sales from to is primarily related to a decline in depreciation expense and bandwidth costs 
the decline in these costs was partially offset by an increase in content amortization and traffic acquisition costs 
depreciation costs have declined from as much of our equipment has reached the end of its depreciable life 
bandwidth costs have declined due to the continued renegotiation of these services with our vendors 
traffic acquisition costs have increased due to new marketing programs implemented during the fiscal year 
these marketing programs pay webmasters a one time fee of of the first month s membership revenue 
the effect of these marketing programs has been to attract additional traffic to our site  resulting in a slight reduction in our churn rate 
as a result of these new marketing programs  traffic acquisition costs increased from of net membership revenue in to of net membership revenue in content amortization costs increased during because we are fully allocating the amortization of the pleasure library to the internet group since this content is primarily utilized within the ten 
com website 
operating income the increase in operating income form to is primarily due to the fact that our revenue  cost of sales and operating expenses all declined by million from the decline in our operating costs is primarily related to a decrease in legal costs 
in fiscal year  our legal expenses included a million non recurring charge for a settlement of a lawsuit 
the decrease in our legal costs was partially offset by an increase in costs related to the development and distribution of content to wireless platforms 
these costs included consulting costs  the hiring of dedicated wireless personnel  and our attendance at several wireless trade shows 
the decline in operating income from to is primarily due to the fact that our cost of sales and operating expenses declined by million while our revenue declined by million year over year 
the decline in operating expenses from to was primarily related to a decrease in legal  advertising  payroll  and property tax expenses 
legal expenses during  which declined from  included a non recurring million charge for the settlement of a lawsuit during the year 
restructuring recovery in millions year ended march restructuring recovery restructuring recovery as part of the internet group restructurings that were completed during the fiscal years ended march  and  we had accrued approximately million for excess office space in sherman oaks  california 
during the fiscal year  we reached a final settlement with the landlord for this space 
as part of the settlement  we paid  to the landlord and we were released from any ongoing obligations for the space 
the million of rent restructuring reserve remaining at that time was reversed into income as a result of this settlement 
film production group the following table sets forth certain financial information for the film production group for the year ended march in millions february march  net revenue repped title revenue owned title revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses net loss we completed the acquisition of the film production group on february  the results above are for the period february through march  revenue repped title revenue represents revenue from the licensing of film titles which we represent but do not own under international sales agency agreements with various independent film producers 
we have a portfolio of approximately titles that we represent through our mainline releasing and lightning entertainment labels 
we license the international television rights of these films to third parties on behalf of the various independent film producers we represent 
we will prepare the title for market by creating trailers  art work  and by ensuring the title conforms to broadcast standards in each particular territory 
cost incurred to prepare the title for market in this manner  as well as the marketing costs incurred at the shows attended throughout the year such as advertising and film screening costs are paid by us on behalf of the producer 
we will earn a commission of of the fees collected for licensing the title plus a marketing fee for most titles that we represent 
the costs we incur are recovered  as well as any monies advanced to the producer prior to licensing the movie to third parties  as fees are collected for licensing the film in the various international territories or domestically  if applicable 
we recover all costs incurred and advances paid to the producer before we remit any license fees to the producer 
we will typically recover all costs incurred and monies advanced to a producer  plus earn our marketing fee  within the first months of the sales agency relationship 
commissions are earned on the license fees once all appropriate revenue recognition criteria has been met 
we will generally earn a commission for films where we represent the domestic television rights 
owned title revenue is earned by licensing the rights to the content in our library or newly produced content consisting of erotic thrillers and adult reality style event content 
our library currently consists of hours of content  including a small amount of mainstream genres such as horror films 
we generally develop hours of new content annually 
titles are licensed on a flat fee basis to cinemax and showtime 
revenue is generally earned once the content is delivered to the licensee in the case of a flat fee arrangement 
we also license our erotic thrillers and event content on a monthly basis to direct tv and to in demand for distribution to cable msos 
our content is licensed to direct tv and in demand on a revenue sharing basis 
revenue is earned once the cash is collected and the amount becomes fixed and determinable 
therefore  revenue may fluctuate based upon when cash is collected from these customers 
in addition  other revenue sharing arrangements exist for distribution of our owned content through platforms such as dish  tvn  bskyb  and rogers cable 
we will also license the international rights for our content to various third parties on a flat fee basis 
we have distribution agreements with lionsgate  universal and new line cinema for the delivery of generally titles per year  which are distributed direct to video by these customers 
content licensed to these customers may be our own content or content for which we represent the domestic television rights 
revenue is recognized once the cash is collected and the amount becomes fixed and determinable 
because of this  revenue may fluctuate based upon when cash is collected from these customers 
we generally collect from these customers on a quarterly basis 
because we recently acquired the film production group  and because the film production group was a private company on a cash basis of accounting prior to the acquisition  it is difficult to predict the revenue for this company until we have more quarterly trends to analyze 
we believe that the owned title revenue will be a fairly predictable revenue stream  but that revenue from repped titles may fluctuate based upon when we attend trade shows where these titles will be actively marketed 
additionally  because of the fact that revenue is recognized when cash is collected or content is delivered  we do not believe that the revenue earned from owned titles for the period february march  is necessarily indicative of a full day period of time since some revenue was recognized prior to completion of the acquisition based upon the date of collection or delivery 
cost of sales cost of sales is primarily comprised of amortization of our content as well as delivery and distribution costs related to our owned content 
there are no costs of sales related to the repped title business 
film amortization is determined based on the revenue recognized in the current period for a title divided by the ultimate revenue expected for the title as determined at the beginning of the fiscal year times the unamortized cost for that title 
because of the valuation placed on the film library as a result of the acquisition  our unamortized film cost is higher than prior to the acquisition  resulting in higher amortization costs 
therefore  the margins we are recognizing on content that existed as of february  are much lower than we would normally recognize for the distribution of our content 
as we begin to monetize films that are currently in production over the next months  we would expect that our margins would increase 
currently  our film amortization represents about of our costs of sales 
operating loss we are generating an operating loss primarily because of our film cost amortization  the accrual of the contingent earnout payments related to the acquisition  and the amortization of intangibles identified as part of the acquisition 
under the provisions of the earnout agreement  the two principals of the film production group are able to earn up to million over three calendar years if certain ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization targets are met 
these ebitda targets are partially cumulative over the three year period 
additionally  as part of the valuation of the acquisition  million was allocated to the non compete agreements that we have with the two principals of the film production group 
the value of these non competes are being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
during this period  we incurred approximately  in non recurring costs related to outside services to assist us in integrating our accounting with the corporate accounting group 
other operating costs related to salaries  trade shows  office expense  travel and meals entertainment are generally consistent with our expectations of these costs for the fiscal year 
corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for corporate administration expenses for the three years ended march in millions year ended march percent change vs vs operating expenses expenses related to corporate administration include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the pay tv  internet and film production operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq and the sec  investor relation cost  and printing costs associated with the company s public filings 
the increase in corporate administrative expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in legal  consulting and payroll costs 
legal fees increased due to a lawsuit that went to trial during the current fiscal year 
we prevailed in the lawsuit and we do not expect to incur any additional expenses related to this issue 
the increase in consulting expense is related to fees paid to the investment banking firm hired by our board to assist us in analyzing strategic alternatives for the company 
this investment banking firm continues to assist us in analyzing additional strategic opportunities for the company 
the increase in payroll costs is due to additional accounting personnel hired during the year  an increase in annual salaries of our executives  and the addition of a vp of marketing and corporate strategy to the corporate staff 
the increase in legal  consulting and payroll costs was partially offset by a decrease in accounting fees related to lower costs associated with our continuing compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act section 
we anticipate that in these fees will be consistent with those incurred in our current fiscal year as we will utilize an outside consulting firm to assist us with developing and documenting the processes and procedures necessary to ensure that our film production group is in compliance with section the increase in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to a an increase in outside accounting fees  b an increase in listing fees  and c an increase in payroll costs 
these costs were partially offset by declines in consulting and legal fees 
outside accounting fees increased from due to our efforts to comply with section during the current fiscal year  we hired an outside consulting firm to assist us with documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting as required by section in addition  our external audit fees increased as a result of the additional audit work required for section listing fees increased from due to the payment of a one time fee for our application to the nasdaq national market during the fiscal year ended march  payroll costs increased from as a result of additional personnel hired by our accounting and legal departments as well as to an increase in executive bonuses 
the decline in consulting expense is related to fees paid during to our former chief executive officer and to a non cash expense related to the extension of his stock options 
outside legal fees declined due to the addition of an in house attorney who was able to internally manage many legal issues that we had outsourced in past years 
deferred taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion will not be realized 
the company routinely evaluates its recorded deferred tax assets to determine whether it is still more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
during the fiscal year  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our net operating losses 
accordingly  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance 
net deferred tax liabilities of approximately million pertain to certain temporary differences related to purchased intangibles and the film library  which were acquired as part of the mrg acquisition completed during the current fiscal year 
during the year ended march   we recognized a net deferred tax asset of  related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we determined that it was more likely than not that million of our net deferred tax assets would not be realized and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance for this amount 
the million relates to potentially expiring net operating loss carryforwards 
during the years ended march   we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and we  accordingly  recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of million 
during the year ended march   the company generated taxable income against which these tax attributes were applied  and accordingly  reversed a portion of the valuation allowance except as explained below 
during the year ended march   options and warrants were exercised and certain disqualifying dispositions occurred resulting in deductions for tax purposes 
similar benefits were included in the company s net operating losses 
these deductions resulted in a benefit of million to additional paid in capital during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in millions year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities purchases of equipment and furniture redemption of available for sale securities purchase of available for sale securities other payment for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired restricted funds held in escrow net cash used in investing activities the decline in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily related to the amount spent on content licensing prepaid distribution rights increased million to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year  accounts receivable increased million during the fiscal year  as compared to an increase in accounts receivable of million in the fiscal year  a decline in tax benefits from the exercise of options and warrants to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year  an increase in net income of million from the fiscal year  the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily related to the amount spend on licensing content declining to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
million of tax benefits from the exercise of options and warrants during the fiscal year 
an increase in net income from net cash used in investing activities increased slightly from we experienced a net redemption of the investments of our excess cash balances of million during the fiscal year as we accumulated the short term cash position necessary to complete the acquisition of mrg 
we paid million for the purchase of mrg during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  million related to this acquisition is being held in escrow pending the resolution of certain contingencies 
our capital expenditures for the fiscal year of million related to the purchase of software for our wireless platform  editing equipment  descrambling equipment necessary for new cable launches  and miscellaneous computers  servers  switches and software 
the increase in cash used in investing activities from to was primarily related to the investment of our excess cash balances in certificates of deposits and fixed income debt instruments with limited maturities during the fiscal year 
in addition  our capital expenditures of million during the fiscal year were related to the final leasehold improvements made to our digital broadcast facility  the purchase of a new storage area network solution to allow for increased redundancy and efficient future storage expansion  and various servers  computers  editing and broadcasting equipment 
purchases of equipment and furniture accounted for a portion of the significant cash outlays for investing activities in the fiscal year ended march  purchases of equipment and furniture during the fiscal year related primarily to purchases of broadcast equipment  including a new broadcast cluster to allow for increased redundancy of our digital broadcast center  purchases of encrypting equipment necessary for new cable launches  and leasehold improvements necessary to upgrade our digital broadcast facility 
purchases of investments represented the next most significant investing activity during the fiscal year 
these purchases related to certificates of deposits in which we invested during the year 
financing activities our cash flows used in provided by financing activities are as follows in millions year ended march  cash flows used in provided by financing activities payments on capital lease obligations decrease notes payable line of credit stock options warrants exercised retirement of stock issuance of redeemable preferred stock redemption of redeemable preferred stock other net cash used in provided by financing activities as part of the mrg acquisition  we assumed the debt outstanding on a line of credit and interest payable in the amount of million 
we paid down this line of credit to simultaneously with the closing of the acquisition 
this use of cash was only slightly offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year of million 
during the fiscal year  we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
this cash from financing activities was offset by the repayment of a million secured note payable that was due to an unrelated third party 
during the fiscal year  we issued million shares of class b redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem million of the company s class a redeemable preferred stock and to fund the purchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of new frontier media  inc common stock  valued at million  from edward bonn  a former officer of the company 
we also redeemed million of the class a and class b redeemable preferred stock during the fiscal year and million of the class b redeemable preferred stock was converted into a note payable  which was then subsequently repaid 
much of our cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year was offset by the exercise of stock options and warrants which generated cash from financing activities of million 
if we were to lose our major customers that account for   and of our revenue as of the year ended march   respectively  our ability to finance our future operating requirements would be severely impaired 
we currently have a million line of credit available through a commercial banking relationship 
this line of credit expires in july the interest rate applied to the line of credit is variable based on the current prime rate 
the balance on the line of credit is currently and we have not drawn down on it during our fiscal year 
the line of credit  if utilized  would be secured by our pay tv group s trade accounts receivable and it requires that we comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately million  content licensing expenditures to be approximately million  and our film production expenditures to be approximately million during our fiscal year 
in december  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan to purchase up to million shares of our stock over months 
at our current stock price  this would require a use of cash of approximately million over the next months 
to date no shares have been repurchased 
as part of the mrg acquisition we entered into an earnout agreement  which would require a million payment over three calendar years if certain ebitda targets are met 
we entered into a two year agreement with direct tv for the distribution of two of our services beginning april this agreement requires us to meet certain performance targets 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these performance targets  we may have to provide certain rebates to direct tv up to  but not exceeding  the amount of the license fees earned from direct tv 
we believe that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements  and we believe that any capital expenditures  content licensing or film production costs that may be incurred can be financed through our cash flows from operations

it also addresses transactions in which an entity  in an exchange for goods or services  incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is principally confined to cash in the bank  money market accounts  and notes payable  which have short maturities and  therefore  minimal and immaterial market risk 
interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had cash in checking and money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and fixed income debt securities 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these assets 
furthermore  the company s borrowings are at fixed interest rates  limiting the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exposure
