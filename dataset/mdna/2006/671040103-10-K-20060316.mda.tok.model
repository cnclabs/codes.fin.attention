item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a mid cap biotechnology company committed to building a scientifically strong and financially successful top tier biopharmaceutical organization that discovers  develops and commercializes innovative molecular targeted therapies addressing major unmet medical needs in oncology  ophthalmology and diabetes 
the launch in the united states in november of our flagship anti cancer product  tarceva erlotinib  a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor  or her egfr  represented a major milestone in the growth of our company 
tarceva was initially approved for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  patients who have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and subsequently  in november  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with the chemotherapy agent  gemcitabine 
tarceva was also approved for sale in the european union  or eu  for the treatment of nsclc in september tarceva was the most successful oncology drug launch in the united states in terms of number of patients treated during the first months of launch  and had the fourth most successful oncology drug launch in terms of sales in the united states 
total us net sales for tarceva for were approximately million and worldwide net sales reflecting a late launch in the eu were approximately million 
in  we set out to define and execute a strategy that would allow us to build upon our initial success with tarceva and establish a company capable of delivering long term  sustainable growth and value creation to our stockholders 
we believe that in order to achieve this goal we need to operate in two to three areas of attractive commercial potential that allow us to broadly leverage our core strengths in the discovery and development of novel molecular targeted therapies  continue to be a scientific innovator enabling us to deliver a novel and differentiated pipeline of products that represent major commercial opportunities by addressing significant unmet medical needs  and establish sustainable revenue growth allowing the significant reinvestment in research and development programs necessary for the creation of a strong portfolio while delivering the profitability and financial strength anticipated by many stockholders following tarceva approval 
the successful execution of this strategy also will allow us to mitigate the risks associated with dependence on a single product and a single disease area while continuing to build on our historical strengths in oncology and broader target based drug discovery 
we believe we now have established the strategic and operating framework from which to build a scientifically strong and financially successful biopharmaceutical company 
oncology  ophthalmology and diabetes represent three of the most attractive areas of commercial growth in the biotechnology pharmaceutical industries 
in tarceva and macugen we have two scientifically innovative products that are both in the early stages of their product life cycles and which  together with our partners genentech and roche for tarceva and pfizer inc for macugen  we believe we can grow into appreciable sources of ongoing revenue 
our emerging pipeline of products in oncology and back of the eye disease  along with our diabetes franchise with three novel and differentiated agents in clinical development represents an additional source of future value which  with our assembled research and development infrastructure and established team of scientists and clinicians  we believe we are well equipped to pursue 
our two high quality commercial organizations in the specialty areas of oncology 
table of contents and back of the eye disease give us the ability to add significant value to our partners efforts to commercialize tarceva and macugen in the united states and the future opportunity to commercialize our oncology and ophthalmology pipeline products in the us market on our own 
in addition  our patent portfolio around dipeptidyl peptidase iv  or dpiv  the target for our leading diabetes drug candidate  psn  an oral small molecule inhibitor of dpiv  could generate a valuable nearer term flow of royalty revenues from first in class competitor products  one of which is currently under review at the us food and drug administration  or fda  and is scheduled to come to market in the next nine to months if approved  and one of which is scheduled for filing with the fda in the first quarter of as we move forward our focus will be on executing the core elements of a business plan designed to draw out the growth and value that we believe to be inherent in the strategic framework that we have established 
we are committed to achieving this in a disciplined manner and to balance all of our investments in the longer term against the need to deliver revenue growth and profitability for our stockholders in the nearer term 
will be an important year for us as we begin the transition to a profitable  biopharmaceutical company 
many companies have struggled with the challenge of balancing investment in research and development  or r d  to create and develop a successful portfolio with the need to become a profitable enterprise 
we recognize that this transition will be no less challenging for us 
we have already assembled an innovative pipeline with six product candidates in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development 
if we are successful in developing these product candidates into commercial products  they may provide us with significant revenue streams and profitability beyond however  it will take a great deal of capital and financial resources over the next four to six years to bring these products to the market 
in the past few years  we have primarily relied on the capital markets for the financial resources to fund our r d 
while we may continue to access the capital markets from time to time as needed  it is our intention to primarily rely on our ability to generate profits and related cash flows including the cash flows from potential partnering activities to fund future r d 
our acquisition of eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc in november  or the eyetech acquisition  was a core part of our strategy to develop into a financially and scientifically diversified biopharmaceutical company 
eyetech s lead product  macugen  was the first vegf inhibitor approved by the fda to treat age related macular degeneration  or wet amd  a disease which left untreated results in vision loss and blindness 
in  it achieved approximately million of total us net sales 
based on the sales trajectory in the fourth quarter of and coupled with the significant cost reductions we put into place in december after we acquired eyetech  macugen was anticipated to generate a significant level of cash flow in  after considering the investment in ophthalmology related r d and commercial costs 
however  the competitive environment for macugen is rapidly evolving and may be especially challenging in macugen is facing serious competition from the off label use of avastin bevacizunab a biological product approved by the fda to treat some forms of cancer 
in addition  we anticipate that lucentis tm ranibizumab  a key competitive agent from genentech  may launch as early as july  six months sooner that we had anticipated at the time of the eyetech acquisition 
we have developed a strategy that we believe effectively positions macugen as a safe and effective agent that can be used as chronic maintenance therapy in the long term treatment of wet amd and in the primary treatment of patients with high cardiovascular risk 
however there is considerable uncertainty in the rapidly changing wet amd marketplace and this strategy may not be successful 
if we are not successful  this will impact our ability to become profitable in and will also reduce our current level of capital resources 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates and the estimated amounts could differ significantly under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
eyetech purchase accounting the purchase price related to the merger with eyetech was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
a third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets  and certain property  plant and equipment  and in determining the useful lives of such tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  determining the product life and term of estimated future cash flows  and developing appropriate costs  expenses  depreciation and amortization assumptions  tax rates  discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
these assumptions are based on the best available information that we had at the time 
additionally  certain estimates for the purchase price allocation including liabilities associated with restructuring activities may change as subsequent information becomes available 
revenue recognition net revenues from unconsolidated joint business net revenues from unconsolidated joint business are related to our co promotion and manufacturing agreements with genentech for tarceva 
it consists of our share of the pretax co promotion profit generated from our co promotion arrangement with genentech for tarceva  the partial reimbursement from genentech of our sales and marketing costs related to tarceva and the reimbursement from genentech of our manufacturing costs related to tarceva 
under the co promotion arrangement  all us sales of tarceva and associated costs and expenses  except for a portion of our sales related costs  are recognized by genentech 
we record our share of the co promotion pretax profit on a quarterly basis  as set forth in our agreement with genentech 
pretax co promotion profit under the co promotion arrangement is derived by calculating us net sales of tarceva to third party customers and deducting costs of sales  distribution and selling and marketing expenses incurred by genentech and us 
the costs incurred during the respective periods represent estimated costs of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review 
based on past experience  we do not believe that these adjustments  if any  will be significant to our consolidated financial statements 
the partial reimbursement of sales and marketing costs related to tarceva is recognized as revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we defer the recognition of the reimbursement of our manufacturing costs related to tarceva until the time genentech ships the product to third party customers at which time our risk of inventory loss no longer exists 
our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  as a result of an amendment to our collaboration agreement with genentech in june  milestone payments received from genentech after june and the remaining portion of the 
table of contents unearned upfront fee are being recognized in accordance with eitf milestones received from genentech after june and the remaining unearned upfront fee are being recognized over the term of our manufacturing and supply agreement with genentech  under which the last items of performance to be delivered to genentech are set forth  on a straight line basis  which approximates the expected level of performance under the manufacturing and supply agreement 
in march  we agreed to a further global development plan and budget with our partners  genentech and roche  for the continued development of tarceva 
for purposes of eitf  the revised development plan and budget for tarceva was deemed a material amendment to our roche agreement and therefore future milestones received from roche will be recognized in accordance with eitf accordingly  future milestone payments received from roche after march will be initially recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected term of the research collaboration on a straight line basis  which approximates the expected level of performance under the development plan 
product sales product sales consists primarily of sales of macugen  and to a lesser extent  gelclair  a bioadherant oral gel for the relief of pain associated with oral mucositis in the united states and its territories 
macugen is sold primarily to distributors  who  in turn  sell to physicians  a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and federal government buying groups 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under an agreement with pfizer dated february  we share sales and marketing responsibility for sales of macugen in the united states 
we report product revenue on a gross basis for these sales 
we have determined that we are qualified as a principal under the criteria set forth in eitf issue  reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent  based on our responsibilities under our contracts with pfizer  which include manufacture of product for sale in the united states  distribution  ownership of product inventory and credit risk from customers 
we record allowances for distribution fees  product returns and governmental rebates for all of our products sold in the united states currently macugen and gelclair at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such allowances 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in determining these allowances 
for instance our distributors have a limited right of return for unopened product during a specified time period based on the product s labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the allowance for product returns  we estimate the likelihood that product sold to distributors might be returned within a specific timeframe 
we determine our estimates using actual product data from distributors  industry data on products with similar characteristics and the expiration dates of product sold 
certain government buying groups that purchase our product from wholesalers have the right to receive a discounted price from us 
as a result  we estimate the amount of product which will ultimately be sold to these buying groups 
we determine our estimates using actual product data from distributors and historical industry trends 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we defer the recognition of revenue on product shipments of gelclair to wholesale customers until such time as the product is sold from the wholesale customer to the retail and non retail outlets 
for each reporting period  we monitor shipments from wholesale customers to pharmacies and hospitals and wholesale customers reorder history based on data from an external third party 

table of contents collaborative revenue collaborative program revenues represent funding arrangements for macugen r d with pfizer and are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts and related research and development activities undertaken 
based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with pfizer inc  revenues derived from reimbursements of costs associated with the development of macugen are recorded in compliance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
according to the criteria established by these eitf issues  in transactions where we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we have met the criteria to record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursements 
sales commissions sales commissions from novantrone on net oncology sales are recognized in the period the sales occur based on the estimated split between oncology sales and multiple sclerosis sales  as determined on a quarterly basis by an external third party 
the split between oncology and multiple sclerosis sales is subject to further adjustment based on the parties final review in the subsequent quarter 
based on past experience  we do not believe these adjustments  if any  will be significant to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory included in inventory are raw materials and work in process for tarceva that may be used in the production of pre clinical and clinical product  which will be expensed to research and development cost when consumed for these uses 
tarceva is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the weighted average method 
prior to receipt of fda approval of tarceva for commercial sale on november   we had expensed all costs associated with the production of tarceva to research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
effective november   we began to capitalize the costs of manufacturing tarceva as inventory  including the costs to label  package and ship previously manufactured bulk inventory which costs had already been expensed as research and development 
at december   the cost reflected in a portion of the finished goods inventory for tarceva consisted solely of cost incurred to package and label work in process inventory that had been previously expensed 
as we continue to process the inventory that was partially produced and expensed prior to november   we will continue to reflect in inventory only those incremental costs incurred to complete such inventory into finished goods 
in november  we recorded finished goods and work in process inventory that we acquired from eyetech at estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory less costs of disposal and a reasonable selling profit to both complete and sell the product 
the increase in fair value of the inventory of million will be included in cost of goods when the acquired inventory is sold in the future 
macugen inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  and our inventory costs are determined using the weighted average method 
inventory is comprised of three components raw materials  which are purchased directly by us  work in process  which is primarily active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  where title has transferred from our contract manufacturer to us  and finished goods  which is packaged product ready for commercial sale 
gelclair inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method 
during the year ended september   we recorded a provision of million for purchase commitments and excess inventory that we considered to be in excess of forecasted future 
table of contents demand based on the expiration date of the product on hand 
in late october  we exercised our right to terminate our distribution agreement with helsinn for gelclair 
the termination was effective january  however  we are continuing to sell off our remaining inventory per the agreement 
during the three months ended december   we recorded an adjustment of million to reduce the previously recorded provision for gelclair inventory as a result of a settlement agreement with helsinn 
accruals for clinical research organization and clinical site costs we make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical site costs 
we analyze the progress of clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
goodwill and other long lived assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
it specifies the criteria which intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred 
we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill at december   and determined that no impairment charge was required 
our identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization 
sfas no 
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
we review our intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
our most significant intangible asset is for the acquired core and developed technology related to macugen 
we continually monitor sales activity and market and regulatory conditions for macugen for the existence of any impairment indicators 
in october  we determined that it was necessary to record an impairment charge as of september  related to our intangible asset for exclusive distribution rights to the marketed product  gelclair  in north america 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired which may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
years ended december  and in december  we changed our fiscal year end from september to december the first fiscal year which will henceforth be the calendar year affected by this change ended on december  included in item of this annual report on form k  or the form k  are the consolidated balance sheets at december  and and the consolidated statements of operations  
table of contents consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december   for the three month transition period ending december   and for the years ended september  and in order to provide the reader meaningful comparison  the following analysis provides comparison of the audited year ended december  with the unaudited year ended december  derived from the results of operations of the last nine months of fiscal year ended september  and the transition quarter ended december  and the historical analysis for the years ended september  and results of operations our net losses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
our results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations of eyetech for the period from november   the date of the acquisition  through december  on an overall basis  our net loss declined significantly in as we recognized the net profits from our tarceva partnership with genentech and royalties from international sales of tarceva from roche 
the net loss included in process r d charges of million in connection with the acquisition of eyetech and the acquisition of the minority interest shares in prosidion 
the net loss included an in process r d charge of million for the acquisition of certain assets of probiodrug ag by prosidion  a charge of million related to the impairment of the gelclair intangible asset and a charge of million for excess inventory 
revenues year ended december  in thousands change net revenue from unconsolidated joint business product sales royalties on product sales sales commissions license  milestone and other revenues collaborative program revenues total revenues net revenue from unconsolidated joint business net revenue from unconsolidated joint business is related to our co promotion and manufacturing agreements with genentech for tarceva 
for the twelve months ended december   genentech recorded million in net sales of tarceva in the united states and its territories 
our share of these net sales is reduced by the costs incurred for cost of goods sold and on the sales and marketing of the product 
for the year ended december   we reported net revenues of million from our unconsolidated joint business for tarceva 
the revenues from our unconsolidated joint business of million for the quarter ended december  represents an increase of million over the quarter ended september  we continue to be confident in the long term prospects of tarceva 
product sales product sales for primarily consists of sales of macugen  and  to a lesser extent  gelclair  in the united states and its territories 
for the twelve months ended december   macugen net sales totaled million 
net sales of macugen from november   the date we acquired eyetech  through december   totaled million  and are included in product sales for the twelve months ended december  net macugen sales represents gross product revenue less 
table of contents distribution service fees and estimates for allowances and returns 
at december   we estimate that our wholesale distribution network had approximately three weeks of macugen supply on hand based on current product demand 
product sales also includes sales of gelclair of  and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
royalties on product sales we receive royalties on the sales of tarceva and macugen outside of the united states and its territories 
in september  roche received approval from the european commission for the sale of tarceva in the eu for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsclc 
tarceva was approved for this indication by the swiss health authority  swissmedic  in march and by health canada in july our partner  roche  began selling in switzerland and canada in march and july  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   roche recorded million in net sales of tarceva outside of the united states and its territories  of which we recorded million in royalty revenues 
macugen royalties on rest of world sales were  from november   to december   and are included in royalties on product sales for the twelve months ended december  macugen was approved for marketing and sale in the eu in february and we expect our partner  pfizer  to launch macugen in the eu in may sales commissions sales commissions represent commissions earned on the sales of novantrone in the united states for oncology indications 
sales commissions for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
sales commissions were lower compared to the prior year period and are expected to be significantly lower in as we approach patent expiration in april the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product  therefore  we expect a significant decrease in our commissions related to novantrone as we approach patent expiration or shortly thereafter as a result of an expected decrease in oncology sales 
we also believe that a worsening reimbursement environment under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of may have contributed to the decrease in the current period 
license  milestone and other revenues we recognized million of license  milestone and other related revenues for the year ended december   of which million related to upfront fees and milestone payments relating to worldwide non exclusive license agreements entered into by prosidion under our dpiv patent portfolio covering the use of dpiv inhibitors for treatment of type diabetes and related indications 
also included in license and milestone revenues is the recognition of the ratable portion of the million upfront fees from genentech and the ratable portion of the million of milestone payments received from genentech and roche to date in connection with various regulatory acceptances and approvals for tarceva in the united states and europe 
these payments were initially deferred and are being recognized as revenue in accordance with eitf the ratable portion of these upfront fees and milestone payments for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the unrecognized deferred revenue related to these upfront fees and milestone payments received from genentech and roche was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
upon regulatory approvals and filings subsequent to december   additional milestone payments will be due from genentech  roche and pfizer 
future milestone payments will be due from roche upon the successful approval of tarceva in a second oncology indication in the eu 
additional milestone payments will be due from genentech and roche upon approval of adjuvant indications in the united states and europe 
additional milestone payments will be paid by roche upon registration of tarceva in japan 
milestone payments will be due from pfizer based on the launch of macugen in the eu and future approvals of macugen for additional indications beyond the treatment of wet amd 
the 
table of contents ultimate receipt of these additional milestone payments is contingent upon the applicable regulatory approvals and other future events 
collaborative program revenues collaborative program revenues represents reimbursement of a portion of research and development costs for macugen under our collaboration agreement with pfizer for the period november  through december   and totaled million 
expenses year ended december  in thousands change cost of goods sold collaborative profit share net expense from unconsolidated joint business research and development acquired in process research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of intangible asset amortization of intangibles cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in  cost of goods sold consisted of million related to macugen for the period between november  through december   million related to tarceva and  related to gelclair 
in  cost of goods sold consisted of  related to tarceva and million related to gelclair 
in november  in connection with the acquisition of eyetech  we recorded the acquired macugen inventory at its estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
included in cost of product sales in was approximately million of the step up in fair market value from the purchase accounting adjustments 
we expect that approximately million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to macugen will be included in future cost of product sales 
the increase to fair market value is being recognized as cost of product sales when the acquired inventory is sold 
for the years ended december  and  tarceva cost of goods sold for manufacturing related expenses associated with the sale of tarceva to genentech was million and  respectively 
prior to receipt of approval of tarceva for commercial sale on november   we had expensed all costs associated with the production of tarceva to research and development 
effective november   we began to capitalize the costs of manufacturing tarceva as inventory  including the costs to label  package and ship previously manufactured bulk inventory whose costs had already been expensed as research and development 
although it is our policy to state inventory reflecting full absorption costs until we sell all of our existing inventory for which all or a portion of the costs were previously expensed  certain components of inventory will continue to reflect costs incurred to process into finished goods previously expensed raw materials and work in process 
we anticipate that our cost of goods will continue to increase through from quarter to quarter as we work through our previously expensed inventory and sales of tarceva increase 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and the three months ended december  would have been million and  higher  respectively  if the tarceva inventory sold had reflected the full absorption 
table of contents manufacturing costs 
the increased costs presented in this manner are more reflective of our cost of goods sold going forward 
for the years ended december  and  gelclair cost of goods sold were  and million  respectively 
the decrease in cost of goods for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily related to a provision of million for gelclair inventory that we deemed in excess of forecasted demand  based on the expiration date of the product 
collaborative profit share collaboration profit sharing represents pfizer s share of net product sales of macugen less cost of goods sold within the united states for the period between november  and december  under our agreements with pfizer  we will share profits and losses from the commercialization of macugen in the united states until the later of years after commercial launch in the united states and the expiration of the unites states patent rights for macugen 
net expense from unconsolidated joint business net expense from unconsolidated joint business is related to our co promotion and manufacturing agreements with genentech for tarceva 
it consists of our share of the pretax co promotion loss generated from our co promotion arrangement with genentech for tarceva  the partial reimbursement from genentech of our sales and marketing costs related to tarceva  and the reimbursement from genentech of our manufacturing costs related to tarceva 
for the period from the product launch on november   through december   genentech recorded million in net sales of tarceva in the united states and its territories 
the resulting net expense from unconsolidated joint business of million was due to the significant costs we  along with genentech  incurred on the sales and marketing of tarceva during the period 
in  this joint business turned profitable  and is reflected in net revenue from unconsolidated joint business 
research and development we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline crucial to the long term process of getting a clinical candidate approved by the regulatory authorities and brought to market 
we manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate a constant flow of clinical candidates into development to offset both the advancement of products to the market and the anticipated attrition rate of drug candidates that fail in clinical trials or are terminated for business reasons 
the duration of each phase of clinical development and the probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
because we manage our pipeline in a dynamic manner  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development  or to the future cash inflows from these programs 
for the years ended december  and  we invested a total of million and million  respectively  in research and million and million  respectively  in pre clinical and clinical development 
we consider this level of investment suitable for a company with our pipeline of clinical and pre clinical candidates 
research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million of research and development expenses related to the programs we acquired from eyetech on november  these expenses reflect the expenses incurred between november  and december  the increase is also associated with an increase in expenses related to our diabetes research  offset by a decrease in oncology expenses 
development costs associated with our diabetes pre clinical and clinical pipeline  including psn  psn  and psn  increased million for 
table of contents the year ended december  over the prior year 
in january  we initiated a phase ii proof of concept and dose range finding study for our dpiv inhibitor  psn offsetting this increase was a million net decrease in our oncology research and development programs primarily associated with the decision to de prioritize or cease development of our clinical candidates  osi l and osi  and the consolidation of our uk based oncology activities into our new york locations  and the million of related realignment charges recorded in the year ended december  we manage the ongoing development program for tarceva with our partners  genentech and roche  through a global development committee under a tripartite agreement among the parties 
together with our partners  we have implemented a broad based global development strategy for tarceva that implements simultaneous clinical programs currently designed to expand the number of approved indications of tarceva and evaluate the use of tarceva in new and or novel combinations 
our global development plan has included major phase iii clinical trials in lung and pancreatic cancer in the past  and currently includes additional major phase iii clinical trials in lung cancer in the maintenance and adjuvant settings 
since  the partners have committed approximately million combined in the global development plan to be shared equally by the three parties 
as of december   we have invested in excess of million in the development of tarceva  representing our share of the costs incurred to date in the tripartite global development plan and additional investments outside of the plan 
we manage the ongoing development program for macugen with pfizer through a collaboration entered into in december whereby the parties jointly develop macugen for the prevention and treatment of diseases 
our current development program includes major phase iii clinical trials in age related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema 
for the period between november   the date of our eyetech acquisition  and december   we have invested million in the development of macugen  of which million has been reimbursed by pfizer 
together with pfizer  we have committed a combined million in for the ongoing development of macugen 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of eyetech in november  we recorded an in process r d charge of million representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also recognized in process r d charges of million in connection with the acquisition of the minority interest shares in prosidion in calendar  and million in connection with the acquisition of probiodrug in calendar selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ending december  and remained constant at million 
however  expenses increased by million as a result of the eyetech acquisition on november  these expenses reflect the expenses incurred between november  and december  this increase was primarily offset by our share of genentech s commercial expenses relating to tarceva no longer being included in selling  general and administrative expense and now being included as part of the co promotion profit and included in the calculation of net revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the year ended december  also included a charge of million for estimated facility lease return costs and the remaining rental obligations net of estimated sublease rental income for the unused portion of our oxford facility resulting from the consolidation of our uk based oncology operations 
the year ended december  included a charge of million for the remaining rental obligations net of estimated sublease rental income for our horsham  pennsylvania facility which we assumed as part of the cell pathways acquisition in june 
table of contents impairment of intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of cell pathways  we assumed the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair in north america 
we recorded an identifiable intangible asset of million which was being amortized over eight and a half years  representing the remaining term of the agreement 
we assess the potential impairment of our long lived asset under the provisions of sfas no 
in performing the recoverability test prescribed by sfas no 
 we determined that the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly related to the gelclair asset was less than the carrying value of the gelclair asset 
as a result an impairment charge was required 
the amount of the impairment charge represents the difference between the fair value of the intangible asset and its associated carrying value 
we calculated the fair value of the intangible asset using discounted cash flows 
the discounted cash flows calculation was made utilizing various assumptions and estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  cash flow and discount rates 
based on these calculations  we determined that an impairment charge of million  which represented the full unamortized balance of the gelclair intangible asset  was necessary as of september  the impairment charge resulted from both the discontinuance of discussions with a replacement dental partner and slower than originally expected sales growth in the oncology marketplace 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in  we recorded amortization expense of million related to macugen  and the related technology platform and patent estate of million acquired in the eyetech acquisition 
the core technology is being amortized over the estimated useful life of years

other income and expense year ended december  in thousands change investment income net interest expense other income expenses net total other income expenses the increase in investment income for the year ended december  over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the funds available for investment  offset by million of previously unrealized losses relating to available for sale marketable securities for which the impairment was deemed other than temporary 
the increase in funds available for investment was the result of the public offering completed in november resulting in net proceeds to us of million  and the convertible note offering completed in december for net proceeds of million 
these cash inflows were significantly offset by net cash outflows of million used in the eyetech acquisition  million for treasury stock repurchases  and million for the call spread option purchase 
investment income is expected to decline in due to the lower available funds for investment 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from the full conversion of the outstanding million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  in july as a result of the conversion  interest expense for the year ended december  primarily represented interest expense on our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  and one half month of interest expense on our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  which were issued in december interest expense for the year ended decem

revenues year ended september  in thousands change product sales sales commissions license  milestone and other revenues collaborative revenues total revenues revenues for fiscal were primarily comprised of sales commissions as compared to sales commissions and collaborative revenues for fiscal this shift reflects our transition from a business centered on funded collaborative programs to one which generates our own product revenues in conjunction with the launch of tarceva 
product sales we began recording gelclair product sales upon the close of our acquisition of cell pathways in june net product sales for fiscal were million compared to  for fiscal the increase was due to a full months of sales in fiscal compared to three and a half months of sales in fiscal we previously had a marketing agreement with john o 
butler company  under which butler marketed gelclair to the dental market 
in april  we agreed with butler to terminate this agreement 
in late october  we exercised our right to terminate our distribution agreement with helsinn upon days notice 
under the terms of the agreement  helsinn had the option to purchase any and all of our inventory at cost plus following termination 
helsinn elected to purchase our inventory  and we were permitted to continue to sell off our inventory on hand 
sales commissions we began recording novantrone sales commissions upon the execution of our co promotion agreement with an affiliate of serono  sa in march sales commissions for fiscal of million were million higher than the fiscal sales commissions of million 
the increase was primarily due to a full months of sales commissions in fiscal compared to six and a half months of sales commissions in fiscal the increase was also due in part to net oncology sales exceeding a contractual threshold limit in both the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  thus resulting in higher effective commissions 

table of contents license  milestone and other revenues license revenues consisted principally of the recognition of the million upfront fees from genentech and roche over the expected term of the collaboration

research and development for fiscal  we invested a total of million in research and million in pre clinical and clinical development 
for fiscal  we invested a total of million in research and million in pre clinical and clinical development 
the marginal increase in the research and development expense for fiscal was primarily due to costs associated with the clinical development of our pipeline  including increases for the development of osi l  osi  osi and aptosyn  of million  as well as an increased investment in prosidion of million 
r d expenses related to prosidion for fiscal were million compared to expenses of million in fiscal included in prosidion s r d expenses in fiscal was a million termination fee paid in cash and prosidion stock to tanabe relating to a termination agreement with tanabe  whereby prosidion obtained the rights to certain compounds and patents developed under the collaboration 
tanabe retained the rights to develop and commercialize  in certain asian territories  compounds covered by such patents 
prosidion was also required to make payments to tanabe upon the achievement of certain milestones 
also included in research and development expense for fiscal was million relating to termination benefits paid to employees and million relating to the acceleration of certain leasehold improvements  in connection with our decision to consolidate our uk based oncology research and development activities into our new york locations 
these increases to research and development expense in fiscal were offset by a decrease in the development expense of tarceva of million due to the completion of the phase iii trials in nsclc and pancreatic cancer  as well as decreased investment in the osi and osi programs of approximately million 
in fiscal  we decided to halt the further development of osi  since we were unable to differentiate the program from a current competitor s product  and osi  since we were unable to overcome certain toxicity issues 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of certain assets from probiodrug by prosidion in july  we recorded an in process r d charge of million in fiscal  representing the estimated fair value of the acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million during fiscal reflects increased investment in our commercial infrastructure as we prepared for the launch of tarceva  as well as our continued investment in supporting our other commercial and pipeline pro 
table of contents grams 
for fiscal  our commercial operation expenses increased approximately million compared to fiscal the most significant component of our investment was commercialization and marketing costs relating to tarceva which were shared with genentech in accordance with the terms of our collaboration 
the increase in commercial cost was also due to additional management and personnel relating to the establishment of a commercial operation to support tarceva  gelclair and novantrone  as well as an additional two quarters of maintenance fees paid to serono relating to novantrone 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were exit costs of million relating to remaining rental obligations for our horsham  pennsylvania and uniondale  new york facilities  termination benefits to employees relating to the consolidation of our uk based oncology research and development activities and the acceleration of depreciation of certain equipment and leasehold improvements at our oxford and uniondale facilities 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were fees paid to serono for transition services provided by them after our acquisition of the novatrone rights  fees paid to celgene corporation in connection with our recovery of the full rights to market and distribute gelclair in north america  and subcontracting expenses related to our transitional arrangement with a contract sales organization as we were building our commercial infrastructure 
impairment of intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of cell pathways  we assumed the exclusive rights to market and distribute gelclair in north america 
we recorded an identifiable intangible asset of million  which was being amortized over eight and a half years  the remaining term of the agreement 
we assess the potential impairment of our long lived assets  under the provisions of sfas no 
in performing such recoverability test we determined that the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly related to the gelclair asset was less than the carrying value of the gelclair asset

based on these calculations  we determined that an impairment charge of million  which represented the full unamortized balance of the gelclair intangible asset  was necessary as of september  the impairment charge is non cash and has not and will not result in future cash expenditures 
the impairment charge resulted from discontinuance of discussions with a replacement dental partner  and slower than originally expected sales growth in the oncology marketplace 
amortization of intangibles the increase of million in fiscal was primarily related to amortization expense related to our rights to novantrone acquired in march and to gelclair acquired in june as noted above  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining carrying value of the gelclair rights as of september  other income and expense year ended september  in thousands change investment income net interest expense other expenses net total other income expenses 
table of contents the decrease in investment income in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the funds available for investment and a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments during these respective years 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal resulted from interest on the notes that we issued in september  as well as the guaranteed interest on the notes that were converted into common stock in july under the terms of the notes  the note holders were guaranteed the payment of interest for the first three years through february  the note holders became fully entitled to the remainder of this guaranteed interest on june   the date we called the notes for redemption 
upon the conversion of the notes  we issued million shares of our common stock in july and recorded a charge of million representing the guaranteed interest on the notes 
this resulted in an additional interest charge of million in fiscal representing the portion of the guaranteed interest from october  to february  included in other expenses net for fiscal and were amortization of debt issuance costs of million and  respectively  related to the convertible senior subordinated notes 
the increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the notes 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over a period of five years  which represents the earliest date that we may redeem the notes 
upon the conversion of the notes  the unamortized balance of the debt issuance costs of million was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
also included in other expenses net for fiscal is minority interest in the net losses of prosidion of  as of september   the minority interests represented approximately ownership of prosidion 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and investments  including restricted securities  was million compared to million at december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the following changes in working capital i net cash of million used in the acquisition of eyetech in november   net of cash acquired  ii net cash of million used in operating activities and iii capital expenditures of million 
the decrease in working capital was offset by net proceeds of million in connection with the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes in december   of which million was used to purchase common stock and call spread options 
on november   during the transition quarter  we concluded a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million after all related fees 
in addition  on november   underwriters associated with the offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million 
on november   we acquired all outstanding shares of eyetech common stock at a purchase price of in cash and shares of osi common stock 
the acquisition reduced the net cash and cash equivalents and investments by approximately million 
on december   we issued convertible notes notes in a private placement resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
on december   the investment bankers associated with this convertible debt offering exercised an option to purchase an additional million of the notes  resulting in an additional net proceeds to us of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  and mature on december  we used a part of the net proceeds to i purchase through the initial purchaser or its affiliates  concurrently with the offering   shares of our common stock for million  and ii pay approximately million to purchase a call spread option with respect to the our common stock 
the call spread is a european type option with a lower strike price of and an upper strike price of and involves an aggregate of million shares of our common stock and expires on december  
table of contents this would have the impact of increasing the effective conversion price of the notes from the company s perspective to per share  representing a conversion premium of approximately to the per share closing price on december  we estimate that over the next twelve to eighteen months  assuming we are able to execute on our internal plans  including our strategy to position macugen as a safe and effective agent that can be used as chronic maintenance therapy in the long term treatment of wet amd and as primary treatment for patients with high cardiovascular risk  our cash flow will become positive  but will fluctuate on a quarter by quarter basis 
however  there continues to be risk that we will not be able to execute on our internal plans 
tarceva  while expected to achieve significant revenues on a worldwide basis and therefore generate significant levels of cash flow for us  potentially faces emerging competition in the united states over the long term and is in the early stages of gaining acceptance in markets outside of the united states including the eu and  in  japan 
macugen is facing intense competition from the continued off label use of avastin in the treatment of wet amd and will face additional competition from lucentis  which we anticipate will launch as early as july we believe we have developed a strategy to meet macugen s competitive threats 
in addition  barriers to the reimbursement of off label avastin for the treatment of wet amd should slow its use 
however  if we are unsuccessful in executing this strategy  our ability to generate positive cash flow in will be impacted and we may not achieve profitability by the end of as originally expected 
we believe that we can manage macugen and the related eye disease franchise of eyetech in a cash flow positive manner in and beyond 
however  it is difficult to estimate the impact of competition from avastin and lucentis on our future revenues for macugen 
if we are able to execute on our internal plans  we expect that our r d investments and capital requirements over the next twelve to eighteen months can be funded from the generation of cash flow and partnering activities 
however  due to the expected fluctuation of cash flow  we may choose to access a borrowing facility on a short term basis to bridge any difference between cash availability and cash needs 
as such  on december   we signed a commitment letter with our commercial banking partner jpmorgan chase bank  na for a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the terms of the revolving credit facility are currently being negotiated and if negotiations are successful  it is expected that the facility will be available to us in the second quarter of as previously stated  we are currently transitioning from an r d stage company  fully dependent on the capital markets for liquidity and capital resources  to a fully integrated and profitable biopharmaceutical company 
when this transition is complete  we anticipate funding the majority  if not all of our liquidity and capital needs from the generation of cash flow from operations  with the potential exception of strategic acquisitions of products and or businesses

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands thereafter total contractual obligations senior convertible debt a operating leases capital commitments purchase obligations b obligations related to exit activities c total contractual obligations a includes interest payments at a rate of per annum relating to the million principal amount of the notes and at a rate of per annum relating to the million principal amount of the notes 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase  for cash  all of the notes  or a portion thereof  in september  and the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase  for cash  all of the notes  or a portion thereof  in december b purchase obligations include inventory commitments  commercial and research commitments and other significant purchase commitments 
c includes payments for termination benefits and facility refurbishments 
other significant commitments and contingencies include the following we are committed to share equally with genentech and roche approximately million combined amount of certain global development costs for tarceva  which represents an increase of approximately million over the originally committed million in the 
table of contents additional million was agreed to by the three parties during these costs will be shared by the parties pursuant to the terms of our agreement with our partners 
as of december   the parties have spent approximately of our commitment under the agreement 
we are also committed to share certain commercialization costs relating to tarceva with genentech 
under the terms of our agreement  there are no contractually determined amounts for future commercial and development costs 
under agreements with external cros we will continue to incur expenses relating to clinical trials of tarceva and other clinical candidates 
the timing and amount of these disbursements can be based upon the achievement of certain milestones  patient enrollment  services rendered or as expenses are incurred by the cros and therefore we cannot reasonably estimate the potential timing of these payments 
we have outstanding letters of credit issued by a commercial bank totaling million of which the full amounts were available on december  one is an irrevocable letter of credit related to our oxford  england facility which expires and is renewed annually with a final expiration date of september  another is an irrevocable letter of credit related to our horsham  pennsylvania facility  whose lease we assumed through the acquisition of cell pathways 
the letter expires and is renewed annually with a final expiration date of september  in connection with the eyetech acquisition  we assumed million of letters of credit associated with the leases of office and laboratory facilities in new york  new york  cedar knolls  new jersey  lexington  massachusetts and woburn  massachusetts 
these irrevocable letters of credit for our acquired leased facilities expire annually with a final expiration date of these letters of credit are collateralized by million invested in high quality certificates of deposit  which is reflected as restricted investments on our balance sheet at december  we have a retirement plan  which provides post retirement medical and life insurance benefits to eligible employees  board members and qualified dependents 
eligibility is determined based on age and years of service 
we have accrued postretirement benefit costs of million at december  in connection with the acquisition of cell pathways  we provided additional consideration in the form of five year contingent value rights through which each share of cell pathways common stock will be eligible for an additional share of our common stock in the event of a filing of a new drug application by june  for either of the two clinical candidates acquired from cell pathways  osi or aptosyn 
under certain license and collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies and educational institutions  we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of products 
however  successful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high risk  and most products fail to reach the market 
therefore  at this time the amount and timing of the payments  if any  are not known 
under certain license and other agreements  we are required to pay license fees for the use of technologies and products in our research and development activities or milestone payments upon the achievement of certain predetermined conditions 
these license fees are not deemed material to our consolidated financial statements and the amount and timing of the milestone payments  if any  are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
in connection with the eyetech acquisition  we assumed various contracts related to the in licensing  development  manufacture and marketing of macugen 
these license agreements represent rights and obligations of osi eyetech 
under the terms of the license agreements  we may be required to make additional milestone payments  and may also be required to pay royalties on net sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio of debt securities  to the fair value of equity instruments held and to foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities

table of contents comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes issued in september and february  we pledged us government securities with maturities at various dates through august and november  respectively 
upon conversion of the notes into our common stock in july  we were required to pay the remaining part of the guaranteed interest 
therefore  the restricted investment securities pledged in relation to these notes were liquidated 
upon maturity  the proceeds of the restricted investment securities will be sufficient to pay the first six scheduled interest payments of the notes when due 
we consider our restricted investment securities to be held to maturity as defined by sfas no 
these securities are reported at their amortized cost  which includes the direct costs to acquire the securities  plus the amortization of any discount or premium  and accrued interest earned on the securities 
we have not used or held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained an investment portfolio principally comprised of government and government agency obligations and corporate obligations that are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical change in interest rates during the twelve months ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our net loss for in march  we began to enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce foreign currency fluctuation risks relating to intercompany transactions for the funding of our research activities in the united kingdom

any ineffectiveness related to the derivative financial instruments change in fair value will be recognized in the period in which the ineffectiveness was calculated

underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make the conversion of the notes or notes to common stock beneficial to the holders of such notes 
conversion of the notes or notes would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share
