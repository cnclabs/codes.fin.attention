overview the company was formed in may  and currently manages offices in colorado  new mexico  and arizona staffed by dentists and specialists 
the company has acquired practices five of which were consolidated into existing offices and one of which was closed during and opened de novo offices one of which was consolidated into an existing office 
the company derives all of its revenue as defined below from its management agreements with the pcs in addition  the company assumes a number of responsibilities when it acquires a new practice or develops a de novo office  which are set forth in the management agreement  as described below 
the company expects to expand in existing markets primarily by enhancing the operating performance of its existing offices and by developing de novo offices 
the company has historically expanded in existing markets by acquiring solo and group dental practices and may do so in the future if an economically feasible opportunity presents itself 
the company was formed with the intention of becoming the leading provider of business services to dental practices in colorado 
the company s growth and success in the colorado market led to its expansion into the new mexico and arizona markets 
the company s growth strategy is to focus on greater utilization of existing physical capacity through recruiting more dentists and support staff and through development of de novo offices and selective acquisitions 
components of revenue and expenses total dental group practice revenue revenue represents the revenue of the offices  reported at estimated realizable amounts  received from third party payors and patients for dental services rendered at the offices 
net revenue represents revenue less amounts retained by the offices 
the amounts retained by the offices represent amounts paid as compensation to employed dentists and hygienists 
the company s net revenue is dependent on the revenue of the offices 
direct expenses consist of the expenses incurred by the company in connection with managing the offices  including salaries and benefits for personnel other than dentists and hygienists  dental supplies  dental laboratory fees  occupancy costs  advertising and marketing  depreciation and amortization and general and administrative including office supplies  equipment leases  management information systems and other expenses related to dental practice operations 
the company also incurs personnel and administrative expenses in connection with maintaining a corporate function that provides management  administrative  marketing  development and professional services to the offices 
under each of the management agreements  the company manages the business and marketing aspects of the offices  including i providing capital  ii designing and implementing marketing programs  iii negotiating for the purchase of supplies  iv staffing  v recruiting  vi training of non dental personnel  vii billing and collecting patient fees  viii arranging for certain legal and accounting services  and ix negotiating with managed care organizations 
the pc is responsible for  among other things  i supervision of all dentists and dental hygienists  ii complying with all laws  rules and regulations relating to dentists and dental hygienists  and iii maintaining proper patient records 
the company has made  and intends to make in the future  loans to pcs in colorado  new mexico and arizona to fund their acquisition of dental assets from third parties in order to comply with the laws of such states 
under the typical management agreement used by the company  the pc pays the company a management fee equal to the adjusted gross center revenue of the pc less compensation paid to the dentists and dental hygienists employed at the office of the pc adjusted gross center revenue is comprised of all fees and charges booked each month by or on behalf of the pc as a result of dental services provided to patients at the office  less any adjustments for uncollectible accounts  professional courtesies and other activities that do not generate a collectible fee 
the company s costs include all direct and indirect costs  overhead and expenses relating to the company s provision of management services at the office under the management agreement  including i salaries  benefits and other direct costs of company employees who work at the office  ii direct costs of all company employees or consultants who provide services to or in connection with the office  iii utilities  janitorial  laboratory  supplies  advertising and other expenses incurred by the company in carrying out its obligations under the management agreement  iv depreciation expense associated with the pcs assets and the assets of the company used at the office  and the amortization of intangible asset value relating to the office  v interest expense on indebtedness incurred by the company to finance any of its obligations under the management agreement  vi general and malpractice insurance expenses  lease expenses and dentist recruitment expenses  vii personal property and other taxes assessed against the company s or the pcs assets used in connection with the operation of the office  viii out of pocket expenses of the company s personnel related to mergers or acquisitions involving the pc  ix corporate overhead charges or any other expenses of the company including the pcs pro rata share of the expenses of the accounting and computer services provided by the company  and x a collection reserve in the amount of of adjusted gross center revenue 
as a result  substantially all costs associated with the provision of dental services at the office are borne by the company  other than the compensation and benefits of the dentists and hygienists who work at the offices of the pcs this enables the company to manage the profitability of the offices 
each management agreement is for a term of years 
further  each management agreement generally may be terminated by the pc only for cause  which includes a material default by or bankruptcy of the company 
upon expiration or termination of a management agreement by either party  the pc must satisfy all obligations it has to the company 
the company s revenue is derived principally from fee for service revenue and revenue from capitated managed dental care plans 
fee for service revenue consists of pc revenue received from indemnity dental plans  preferred provider plans and direct payments by patients not covered by any third party payment arrangement 
managed dental care revenue consists of pc revenue received from capitated managed dental care plans  including capitation payments and patient co payments 
capitated managed dental care contracts are between dental benefits organizations and the pcs under the management agreements  the company negotiates and administers these contracts on behalf of the pcs under a capitated managed dental care contract  the dental group practice provides dental services to the members of the dental benefits organization and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental group practice obligated to provide them 
this arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of these services to the dental group practice providing the dental services 
because the company assumes responsibility under the management agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the pcs associated with the provision of dental services at the office other than compensation of dentists and hygienists  the risk of over utilization of dental services at the office under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the company 
in addition  dental group practices participating in a capitated managed dental care plan often receive supplemental payments for more complicated or elective procedures 
in contrast  under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements  the insurance company pays whatever reasonable charges are billed by the dental group practice for the dental services provided 
see item business payor mix 
the company seeks to increase its fee for service business by increasing the patient volume of existing offices through effective marketing and advertising programs  adding additional specialty services and by opening de novo offices 
the company seeks to supplement this fee for service business with revenue from contracts with capitated managed dental care plans 
although the company s fee for service business generally provides a greater margin than its capitated managed dental care business  capitated managed dental care business serves to increase facility utilization and dentist productivity 
the relative percentage of the company s revenue derived from fee for service business and capitated managed dental care contracts varies from market to market depending on the availability of capitated managed dental care contracts in any particular market and the company s ability to negotiate favorable contractual terms 
in addition  the profitability of managed dental care revenue varies from market to market depending on the level of capitation payments and co payments in proportion to the level of benefits required to be provided

a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates used by management are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as described in financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  which was issued by the securities and exchange commission impairment of intangible and long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred income taxes 
at december   intangible assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet were million  representing of the company s total assets at that date 
the company s dental practice acquisitions involve the purchase of tangible and intangible assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the acquired offices 
as part of the purchase price allocation  the company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on estimated fair market values 
costs of acquisition in excess of the net estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are allocated to the management agreement 
the management agreement represents the company s right to manage the offices during the year term of the agreement 
the assigned value of the management agreement is amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
the company reviews the recorded amount of intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment for each office whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if this review indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of each office  whether acquired or developed  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value 
among the factors that the company will continually evaluate are unfavorable changes in each office  relative market share and local market competitive environment  current period and forecasted operating results  cash flow levels of offices and the impact on the net revenue earned by the company  and the legal and regulatory factors governing the practice of dentistry 
as of december   a review by the company determined that there was no permanent impairment of any long lived or intangible asset at any office 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires management to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while management considers the company s processes to be adequate to effectively quantify its exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may require the company to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the company s significant deferred tax assets are related to accruals not currently deductible  allowance for doubtful accounts and depreciation expense for tax which is less than depreciation expense for books 
the company has not established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets as the company expects to fully recover these amounts in future periods 
the company s significant deferred tax liability is the result of intangible asset amortization expense for tax being greater than the intangible asset amortization expense for books 
management reviews and adjusts those estimates annually based upon the most current information available 
however  because the recoverability of deferred taxes is directly dependent upon the future operating results of the company  actual recoverability of deferred taxes may differ materially from management s estimates 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations and growth through a combination of cash provided by operating activities  a bank line of credit the credit facility and  from time to time  seller notes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

on april   the company amended its credit facility 
the amended credit facility allows the company to borrow  on a revolving basis  an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million at either  or a combination of  the lender s base rate or at a libor rate plus a libor rate margin  at the company s option 
the lender s base rate computes interest at the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus one half percent 
the libor option computes interest at the libor rate as of the date such libor rate loan was made plus a libor rate margin of 
a commitment fee of on the average daily unused amount of the revolving loan commitment during the preceding quarter will also be assessed 
the company may prepay any base rate loan at any time and any libor rate loan upon not less than three business days prior written notice given to the lender  but the company will be responsible for any loss or cost incurred by the lender in liquidating or employing deposits required to fund or maintain the libor rate loan 
the amended credit facility expires on may  at december   the company had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under the revolving loan

the company believes that cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and dividend payments for at least the next months 
in order to meet its long term liquidity needs  the company may need to issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its strategy and could negatively affect its operations in future periods
