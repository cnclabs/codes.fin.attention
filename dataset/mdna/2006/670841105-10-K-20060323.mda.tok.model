item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to implement critical accounting policies and to make estimates that could significantly influence the results of operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates  which significantly influence the results of the company s operations and its financial position  include revenue recognition policies  the valuation allowance for inventories and accounts receivable  evaluation of the impairment of and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  and estimates for future losses on product warranties 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from three sources system sales  part sales  and services 
for system sales and parts sales  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the contract price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return  and  historically  sales returns have not been significant 
system sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  and that involve installation services are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and recognized when the installation is complete 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements  such as accessories ordered by customers  is deferred until the related items are delivered to the customer 
for certain other system sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is generally deferred until customer acceptance 
deferred revenue from such system sales is presented as unearned revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our products generally carry one year of warranty 
once the warranty period has expired  the customer may purchase an extended product warranty typically covering an additional period of one year 
extended warranty billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term 
revenue from extended warranties is deferred and recognized ratably over the duration of the contract 
unearned extended warranty revenue is included in unearned revenues in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments and for estimated sales returns 
customers may not make payments or may return products due to a variety of reasons including deterioration of their financial condition or dissatisfaction with the company s products 
management makes regular assessments of doubtful accounts and uses the best information available  including correspondence with customers and credit reports 
if the company determines that there is impairment in the ability to collect payments from customers  additional allowances may be required 
certain distributors or manufacturer s representatives in growing geographic areas  on management approval  may be allowed to temporarily exceed credit limits to accommodate their growth until new credit limits are considered and established  otherwise representatives are told they must comply with existing credit limits within a specified period of time 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses  but the company could experience increased losses if general economic conditions of its significant customers or any of the markets in which it sells its products were to deteriorate 
this could result in the impairment of a number of its customers ability to meet their obligations  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories consist of electronic equipment and various components 
the company operates in an industry where technological advances or new product introductions are a frequent occurrence 
either one of these occurrences can significantly impair customer demand for a portion of the company s inventory on hand  making it obsolete 
the company regularly evaluates its inventory and maintains a reserve for inventory obsolescence and excess inventory 
as a policy  the company provides a reserve for products with no movement in six months or more and which management determines  based on available market information  are no longer saleable 
the company also applies subjective judgment in the evaluation of the recoverability of the rest of its inventory based upon known and expected market conditions and company plans 
if the company s competitors were to introduce a new technology or product that renders a product sold by the company obsolete or unnecessary  it could have a significant adverse effect on the company s future operating results and financial position 
the company had changes in required reserves in recent periods due to discontinuation of certain product lines and obsolescence related to new product introductions  as well as declining market conditions 
as a result  the company incurred net inventory charges of approximately  during fiscal  approximately  in fiscal  and approximately  in fiscal intangible assets the company s intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january   as required 
accordingly  the company reviews the recoverability and estimated useful lives of other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the intangible assets acquired from intelligent ion  inc iii in december consisted of patents and licenses 
the majority of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research development and was expensed because the technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
product warranties products are sold with warranties ranging from days to one year  and extended warranties may be purchased for some products 
the company establishes a reserve for warranty expenditures and then adjusts the amount of reserve annually  if actual warranty experience is different than accrued 
the company makes estimates of these costs based on historical experience and on various other assumptions including historical and expected product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required

furthermore  improvement in the sale of products to that market is uneven in product mix and may result in lower overall sales to that market segment 
the company continues to encounter strong competition and continues to seek improved distribution strategies for certain products in some channels and markets 
we remain cautiously optimistic about future sales and have identified a number of products and strategies we believe will allow us to grow our business despite a potential market decline  including the acquisition of complementary businesses  the development of new products  development of new applications for our technologies  and the strengthening of our presence in selected geographic markets 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or if successfully implemented  that these strategies will result in growth of the company s business 
historically  inflation nor changing prices have had a material impact on the company s net revenues  however  inflation in certain commodity components included in the company s products has resulted in increased manufacturing cost in some of the company s products which have not been fully recovered in product pricing to customers

the increase in r d expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased expense related to development of a potential new gc mass spectrometer ms product 
the purchase of iii resulted in the company bringing in house development work for a major component of this potential new product and accordingly  we incurred the associated cost 
we anticipate r d expenses to remain at these levels and perhaps increase  depending on the outcome of our efforts and expenses related to any actions we may need to take in attempts to solve technical challenges encountered in our efforts to create a commercial gc ms product 
as stated previously  r d spending will likely increase over historical levels in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenues 
at this time  we plan to remain committed to this plan even at the risk of incurring an operating loss on a quarterly or annual basis

acquired in process research and development on december   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of iii  including intellectual property owned and licensed by iii  and prototype products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail of the transaction 
the purchase price was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including the in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we expensed the entire amount of the in process research and development of  at the date of the acquisition 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of acquired in process research and development at the acquisition date were as follows project name portable gc mass spectrometer percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue at acquisition date calendar year subsequent to the acquisition of these assets and during the whole of  technical progress on the development of a commercial product was slower than predicted at the time of the acquisition because the core patented technology required additional basic research before incorporation into a final product 
the status of the research and development at the end of can be estimated as follows percent completed at the end of estimated costs to complete technology at the end of  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue at the end of calendar year the development of the acquired technology into a commercial product or products remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for a new product  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop this technology into a commercially viable product consists primarily of research  planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technology can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure of our research efforts to prove that the technology will function for the intended purpose  or to bring a product to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on the future prospects of these r d efforts 
first period of expected revenue above should not be relied upon as a commitment or indication of product introduction date 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from a product or products based on this technology will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the purchase was completed and may result in impairment charges to the  of other intangible assets acquired and related intangible assets amounting to approximately  capitalized subsequent to the acquisition 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased  or to  compared to  for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in operating income for the year ended december  is primarily due to the increase in revenues from product sales partially offset by an increase in r d activity  sg a expenditures  and from iii in process research and development expense acquired

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income before income taxes income before income taxes for the year ended december  decreased  or to  compared to income of  for the same period of the prior year

liquidity and capital resources the company considers a number of liquidity measures that aid in measuring the company s ability to meet its financial obligations 
such ratios  working capital  and changes in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the company s last three years are as follows in thousands liquidity measures ratio of current assets to current liabilities total liabilities to equity days sales in accounts receivable average annual inventory turnover working capital    changes in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents beginning of year    end of year    we have historically been able to fund working capital and capital expenditures from operations  and expect to be able to finance our working capital requirements from cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
although the company invests a portion of its excess funds generated from operations in short term securities  including money market funds  treasury bills  and a portion in preferred stocks  the company s primary plan for the use of cash is continuing significant research and development efforts to introduce new products 
other matters which could affect the extent of funds required within the short term and long term include future acquisitions of other businesses or product lines 
we may engage in discussions with third parties to acquire new products or businesses or to form joint ventures 
these types of transactions may require additional funds from sources other than current operations 
we believe that such funds would come from traditional institutional debt financing or other third party financing 
we may also use our capital resources to enhance the company s competitiveness in the marketplace by providing favorable credit terms to more customers  and increase stock levels of certain products to take advantage of market opportunities

no repurchases were made in  but the company may purchase up to an additional  shares under the current stock repurchase program 
the company may seek an expansion of this program in the future if it believes repurchases continue to be in the best interests of the company 
expansion of this program would also be funded from cash from operations
