item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our credit facility  covenant requirements and effects on our business 
we may be unable to maintain favorable comparable restaurant sales results improvements in comparable restaurant sales are a key measure of financial health for our overall company as well as for our individual restaurants 
we experienced a decline in comparable restaurant sales in each year from fiscal through fiscal for our buca di beppo restaurants and each year since fiscal for our vinny t s of boston restaurants 
although we experienced an increase in comparable restaurant sales for buca di beppo in fiscal  our vinny t s of boston restaurants continued to experience declines in comparable restaurant sales and we may not see improvements in comparable restaurant sales in the future 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain positive comparable restaurant sales  we may continue to experience operating losses or negative cash flows and we may close those restaurants  which could result in significant exit costs  including lease termination costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the lease termination costs that we incurred in fiscal and insurers could deny or rescind coverage for securities litigation filed against us which could result in a significant uninsured loss a civil action has been filed against us asserting claims under the securities exchange act of  and seeking compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  plus an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  and the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  however the plaintiffs are likely to seek damages in an amount that would be significant and material to us 
while we have had and continue to maintain directors and officers insurance and have submitted the suit to our insurers for coverage  our insurers have reserved their rights with respect to coverage 
if our insurers were to attempt to deny or rescind coverage and were ultimately successful  we could face significant legal expenses in defending the action and we would have to pay any judgment to  or settlement with  the plaintiffs from our own resources 
such denial or rescission would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us as previously disclosed  we are the subject of an ongoing sec investigation 
we have cooperated with this investigation both before and after issuance of the formal order of investigation in february we understand that the order of investigation relates to our internal controls and compliance with rules governing filings and reports  including public disclosures  required to be filed with the sec  and the purchase of an old farmhouse in italy known as villa sermenino 
we are cooperating and assisting with the sec s investigation in order to bring the inquiry to a conclusion as promptly as possible 
we are unable to predict the ultimate focus or outcome of the investigation  or when it will be completed 
any unfavorable finding from the sec as a result of the investigation could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the sec s investigation 

index to financial statements the costs of the sec investigation and changing corporate governance have and may continue to result in significant additional expenses the costs of the on going sec investigation and the costs of compliance with more stringent corporate governance standards has created significant and material expenses in fiscal that will continue to be significant and material in fiscal we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to cooperate with the sec investigation and to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment have required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
in addition  it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we have purchased coverage at a substantially higher cost than in the past 
because of our recent investigations  director and officer liability insurance may not be available to us at any cost 
further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on us we maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting that is reviewed and monitored by our management and our audit committee and tested by an independent internal audit consulting firm 
as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  our management identified certain material weaknesses in our system of internal controls 
these material weaknesses are discussed in detail in item a 
controls and procedures 
while significant changes in executive personnel were made during fiscal and fiscal  our company has suffered in the past from an inappropriate tone set by former senior executives and a lack of a demonstrable commitment by former senior executives to set high standards of ethics  integrity  accounting and corporate governance 
our board of directors and current management believe that these inappropriate attitudes and deeds of former senior executives led to an environment where strong systems of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures were not supported 
we have taken remedial measures to correct such control deficiencies 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that the controls will be effective in preventing fraud or material misstatement 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and fraud may be easier to perpetrate on us 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on our stock price 
we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we will need substantial capital to finance our operations and expansion plans  including funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  the holdings of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
our credit 
index to financial statements facility limits our capital expenditures in future years  including a maximum of million in fiscal  subject to the satisfaction of certain bank covenants 
we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected  the costs of our internal investigation  the sec investigation  the derivative lawsuit and other related litigation exceed anticipated amounts  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to price  service  restaurant location and food quality  and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  economic conditions  population  and traffic patterns 
we compete within each market with locally owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains  some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than we do 
there is active competition for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
if we are unable to effectively compete within the restaurant industry  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
see item business competition for a discussion of the competition we face 
complaints  litigation  governmental investigations and the related adverse publicity may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
in march  two of our former hourly employees filed a purported class action suit against us in the orange county superior court  state of california 
the action was later transferred to the los angeles superior court  state of california  where it is currently pending 
the complaint alleges causes of action for failure to pay wages overtime  failure to allow meal breaks  failure to allow rest breaks  failure to pay reporting time pay  violation of california business professions code section  and certain statutory damages and penalties 
mediation occurred in february  at which time the parties reached a tentative settlement 
the settlement was preliminarily approved by the court on september  and the court entered its order approving the settlement on january  we expect that the total payments under the approved settlement will be between and million 
the actual amount will be dependent on how many members of the putative class file timely claims 
during the fourth quarter of  based on estimates received from external legal counsel  we recorded an estimated settlement expense of million associated with this legal action 
this expense amount is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying financial statements 
while we know of no other similar lawsuits threatened against us in any other jurisdiction  we can make no assurance that similar lawsuits will not be filed against us in the future 
any such lawsuits that are filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
three virtually identical civil actions were commenced against our company and three former officers in the united states district court for the district of minnesota between august  and september  the 
index to financial statements three actions have been consolidated 
the four lead plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended complaint the complaint on january  the complaint is brought on behalf of a class consisting of all persons who purchased our common stock in the market during the time period from february  through march  the class period 
the lead plaintiffs allege that in press releases and sec filings issued during the class period  defendants made materially false and misleading statements about our company s income  revenues  and internal controls  which allegedly had the result of artificially inflating the market price for our stock 
the lead plaintiffs assert claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  plus an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
on march   we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim and that it fails to plead fraud with the particularity required under the law 
the motion is scheduled for hearing on may  we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
federal securities litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including cash flows 
see also an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us above for a description of an on going sec investigation 
multi unit restaurant businesses can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  food borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
in particular  since we depend heavily on the brands buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston for all of our revenues  unfavorable publicity relating to one or more buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
fluctuations in our operating results may result in decreases in our stock price our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  timing of unexpected charges  general economic conditions  seasonality of restaurant sales  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  impairment of restaurant assets  changes in interest rates  competitive factors and weather conditions 
as a result  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
inflation could materially adversely affect our operating results the majority of our operating expenses have increased due to inflation 
because we are in a competitive industry  we may be limited in the amount of menu prices we can increase 
if we are unable to offset increases in operating expenses due to inflation  it could be materially adversely affect or business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our operating results depend in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
our contract with sysco expires in april after that date  we have agreed to use dma as our primary food distributor 
our agreement with dma will run to april although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available  any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by dma could cause our food costs to increase 
in addition  a failure to perform by sysco during the transition process could cause our food costs to increase 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 

index to financial statements changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature italian cuisine served primarily in small and large family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
our business may also be affected by changes in consumer tastes and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet  nutrition and health 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our restaurant operations are influenced by weather conditions weather  which is unpredictable  can adversely impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm or hurricane can restrict travel in an entire metropolitan area  resulting in a reduction in sales 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and complying with government regulations each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control  health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the state  county and or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
we may experience difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
we also are subject to federal and state environmental regulations and adverse changes in these regulations could have a material negative effect on our operations 
for example  more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the ada  various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted  or rules and regulations promulgated  by federal  state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters 
a material increase in the minimum wage and other statutory benefits could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled  we could be required to reconfigure our restaurants to provide service to  or make reasonable accommodations for  disabled persons 
such modifications could be costly 
we may face liability under dram shop statutes our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply 

index to financial statements we could face potential labor shortages and increases in labor costs our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
in addition  we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips for a significant portion of their income 
government mandated increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leaves of absence  or health benefits  or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities  or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements  could increase our labor costs and reduce our operating margins 
additional instances of avian flu or of mad cow disease or other food borne illnesses could have a material adverse effect on us in and  asian and european countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu 
incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds 
these problems  food borne illnesses such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference 
as a result  our sales could decline 
instances of food borne illnesses  real or perceived  whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors  could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry  which could adversely affect sales 
if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer  we may lose customers who do not accept those changes  and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable 
if our guests become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants 
a decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants  could materially harm our business 
increased energy costs and power outages may adversely affect our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs 
utility costs have been increasing across the country and various regions of the united states in which we operate multiple restaurants  particularly california  have experienced significant and temporary increases in utility prices 
we have in the past closed restaurants on a temporary basis due to the inability to receive electrical power 
if these increases should recur or continue  it may adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  our contract with our new primary food distributor  dma  allows for some fluctuation in distribution fees based on the price of diesel fuel 
a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel may result in increased expenses 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and other natural disasters  and terrorist attacks 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and florida and other earthquake and hurricane prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes and hurricanes 
in the event of an earthquake  hurricane or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 

index to financial statements the terrorist attacks on the united states had a significant impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
with the threats of additional terrorists attacks and continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  there could be a potential downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to expand in a timely and profitable manner during fiscal  we opened a one new restaurant and closed a total of three 
this reflects a reduction in our expansion activities relative to our history 
while we expect to add no new restaurants in fiscal  we do expect to resume growth by adding one to three new restaurants in fiscal to grow successfully through new restaurant additions  we must open new buca di beppo restaurants on a timely and profitable basis 
we have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future 
delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors  some of which are not entirely within our control  including the identification and availability of suitable restaurant sites  competition for restaurant sites  negotiation of favorable leases  timely development in certain cases of commercial  residential  street or highway construction near our restaurants  management of construction and development costs of new restaurants  securing of required governmental approvals  permits and licenses  recruitment of qualified operating personnel  particularly paisano partners and kitchen managers  competition in new markets  limitations under our credit facility  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we may enter new markets in which we have no operating experience 
these new markets may have different demographic characteristics  competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets  which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful in these new markets than in our existing markets

index to financial statements item legal proceedings from time to time  we are a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business  including claims resulting from slip and fall accidents  claims under federal and state laws governing access to public accommodations  employment related claims and claims from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
to date  none of this litigation  some of which is covered by insurance  has had a material effect on us

gadel was our chief financial officer until february motschenbacher was an officer since  and our senior vice president and chief information officer from february until march  in the complaint  we allege that gadel and motschenbacher breached the fiduciary duties of loyalty  good faith  and due care that they owed to us during their tenure as officers  and unjustly enriched themselves  by causing us to enter into unfavorable transactions with companies in which gadel and motschenbacher had undisclosed  material financial interests  causing us
