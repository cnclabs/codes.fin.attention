our acquisition strategy is to integrate acquired businesses into our core business to generate increased revenues  as well as synergies for the company as a whole 
this generally involves transitioning channel partners and end customers to our core products and utilizing acquired development and sales resources to support our core development  sales and marketing activities 
accordingly  we do not have the ability to accurately report revenue from our acquired businesses 
financial highlights net revenue  gross profit margin  and earnings per share are key measurements of our financial results 
for fiscal  net revenue was million  an increase of from fiscal gross profit margin was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the revenue increase was the result of increased sales of our products  primarily to large enterprise customers 
the gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily the result of significant sales of the neoware e thin client product in fiscal the neoware e has higher average selling prices  higher gross profit dollars per unit sold  and lower percentage gross margins than other neoware thin client devices 
diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of increased gross profit from revenue growth  offset by stock based compensation expense  increased operating expenses  and increased cost of amortization of acquired intangibles  as well as a larger number of fully diluted shares due to a stock offering completed in february stock based compensation expense included in these results was  in cost of products sold and million in operating expense for fiscal  and amortization of intangibles was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our fiscal results were also adversely affected by the significant financial difficulties of one of our german distributors  which caused us to reserve revenue of  invoiced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to add  to our reserve for doubtful accounts 
for fiscal  net revenue was million  an increase of from fiscal gross profit margin was for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the revenue increase and gross profit margin percentage decrease was the result of our previously announced strategy to introduce new lower priced products to compete more effectively with personal computers and to pursue large enterprise customers 
diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of increased earnings from revenue growth and the write off in fiscal of million of costs related to acquisitions that were not completed 
as of june   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million at june  we used million of cash in fiscal for acquisitions  generated million of cash from operations  received million from the issuance of common stock and received million of cash from the exercise of stock options and related excess tax benefits 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes stock based compensation these policies and estimates and our procedures related to these policies and estimates are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
please refer to note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates 
our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates and the management discussion and analysis with its audit committee 

back to index revenue recognition for each type of arrangement  we make judgments regarding the fair value of multiple elements contained in our arrangements  whether fees are fixed or determinable whether collectibility is probable  and accounting for potential distributor stock rotation rights and price protection 
these judgments  and their effect on revenue recognition  are discussed below 
multiple element arrangements net revenues include sales of thin client devices  which include the device and related software  maintenance and technical support as well as standalone software products and services 
we follow aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop for revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue related to post contract support services is generally recognized with the initial product sale when the fee is included with the initial product fee  post contract services are for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing such services during the arrangement is insignificant  and unspecified upgrades and enhancements offered during the period are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequent 
otherwise  revenue from extended warranty and post contract support service contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized over the term of the related support period 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of these amounts is determined by the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
the fee is fixed or determinable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether the fees are fixed or determinable 
the majority of our payment terms are within to days after invoice date 
we review arrangements that have payment terms extending beyond days on a case by case basis to determine if the fee is fixed or determinable 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
collection is probable we make judgments at the outset of an arrangement regarding whether collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have had a history of successful collections 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process to evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment 
stock rotation rights and price protection we provide certain distributors with stock rotation rights and price protection 
stock rotation rights are generally limited to a maximum amount per quarter and require a corresponding order of equal or greater value at the time of the stock rotation 
we provide price protection as a rebate in the event that we reduce the price of products that our distributors have yet to sell to end users 
we estimate potential stock rotation and price protection claims based on historical experience and the level of inventories in the distribution channel and reduce current period revenue accordingly 
if we cannot reasonably estimate claims related to stock rotations and price protection at the outset of an arrangement  we recognize revenue when the claims can be reasonably estimated 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions  we allocate portions of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  consisting of acquired technologies  distributor and customer relationships  tradenames and non compete agreements based on independent appraisals received after each acquisition  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to perform a sfas no 
impairment test at least annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

back to index our annual impairment date is june we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment 
the test for goodwill is a two step process first  we compare the carrying amount of our reporting unit  which is the book value of the entire company  to the fair value of our reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we have to perform the second step of the process 
if not  no further testing is needed 
if the second part of the analysis is required  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
we then compare the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we compare the fair value to the book value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the book value  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets  including goodwill  are our net book value compared to our market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  and significant changes to the asset since we acquired it 
we have not recorded an impairment loss on goodwill or other long lived assets 
at june   goodwill and intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
a decrease in the value of our business could trigger an impairment charge related to goodwill and or amortizable intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal  state and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax expense as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our balance sheet and results of operations 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on our assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
stock based compensation prior to june   we accounted for employee stock option plans based on the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and had adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

accordingly  compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the company granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  therefore  the company did not record stock based compensation expense under apb opinion no 

back to index in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r to require that compensation cost relating to share based payment arrangements be recognized in financial statements 
as of july   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock options are determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for stock options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
such fair value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in no cumulative change in accounting as of the date of adoption 
on march   the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides the staff s views on a variety of matters relating to stock based payments 
sab no 
requires stock based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation 
information about stock based compensation included in the results of operations is as follows in thousands year ended june  cost of revenues selling and marketing research and development general and administrative we expect stock based compensation expense to be approximately million for fiscal before income taxes  although this amount may increase if we hire additional executives or a significant number of other additional employees and grant options to them 
this amount may also change as a result of additional grants to existing employees  forfeitures or differences between actual and estimated forfeitures  modifications or other factors 
sfas no 
r provides that income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law 
under current us federal and uk tax laws  we would receive a compensation expense deduction related to non qualified stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received 
accordingly  the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for non qualified stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for compensation expense related to incentive stock options isos unless the underlying shares are disposed of in a disqualifying disposition 
accordingly  compensation expense related to isos is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes which increases the effective tax rate 
for stock based compensation arrangements we make judgments about the fair value of the awards  including the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures  which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
results of operations net revenues in thousands net revenue percentage change over prior period 
back to index we derive revenues primarily from the sale of thin client devices  which include a device and related software and services 
the increases in net revenues in fiscal and fiscal is due to an increase in market acceptance of thin client computing  an increase in our customer base from our selling and marketing activities  including an increase in sales to large enterprise customers and an increase in our business with ibm and lenovo 
unit sales of thin client devices increased in fiscal over fiscal and increased in fiscal over fiscal average selling prices increased slightly in fiscal due primarily to the change in product mix primarily resulting from the introduction of the neoware e  which carries a much higher selling price than our other thin client devices 
average selling prices declined slightly in fiscal due to changes in product mix  our strategy to reduce selling prices to increase sales to large enterprise customers and increased competition 
average selling prices will vary depending on product mix and competitive pricing situations 
the neoware e was introduced in fiscal and contributed of fiscal net revenues 
the following table sets forth sales to customers comprising or more of our net revenue net revenues lenovo ibm north american customer north american distributor european distributor amounts do not exceed for such period net revenues from sales outside of the united states  primarily in europe  the middle east and africa emea  based on the location of our customers  were as follows in thousands international net revenues percentage change over prior period percentage of net revenues international net revenues declined as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher revenue growth in the united states  primarily as a result of an increase in sales to large enterprise customers in the united states 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  one of our german distributors experienced significant financial difficulties and has since declared insolvency  which  in the fourth quarter  caused us to reverse revenues of  invoiced in april through june and to add  to our reserve for doubtful accounts 
we have relationships with several other distributors in central europe  and we expect that they will generate sales to offset the loss of this distributor in the future 
cost of revenues and gross profit margin in thousands cost of products percentage change over prior period amortization of intangibles percentage change over prior period total cost of revenue percentage change over prior period gross profit margin cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of thin client devices  which include a device and related software  and  to a lesser extent  overhead including salaries and related benefits for personnel who fulfill product orders  delivery services  amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions  distribution costs  and beginning in fiscal  stock based compensation expense 

back to index the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of increased unit sales and to a lesser extent to increased amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal  change in product mix with the introduction of the neoware e thin client product in fiscal  which carries a higher unit cost  increased freight costs related to air shipments and fuel cost increases and a charge of  related to the impact of the write up of finished goods inventory to fair value related to the maxspeed acquisition 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of revenues was  in fiscal the increase in cost of revenues in fiscal is primarily the result of increased sales and to a lesser extent to increased amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions completed in fiscal and an increase of  in inventory and warranty reserves due to higher sales 
we continue to benefit from manufacturing efficiencies and component cost reductions achieved through our outsourced production model 
this model depends on high volume production of our thin client device products using components commonly used in personal computers 
we have also benefited from license fee expense reductions due to the acquisition of the teemtalk software business  which we previously licensed prior to fiscal under a royalty fee agreement  and reductions in other software license fees 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal is primarily the result of increased sales of the neoware e thin client device  which has a higher selling price  higher gross profit dollars per unit sold  and lower gross profit margin than our other thin client devices 
the change in gross profit margin in fiscal was the result of increased sales to large enterprise customers  and the result of our strategy to introduce new  lower priced products to increase our share of the personal computer market 
the change in gross profit margin in fiscal is attributable to the increased sales of higher margin software  as well as component and license fee cost reductions 
gross margins for fiscal are projected to be in the range  plus or minus a percentage point or two  including approximately  per quarter of amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions 
gross margins are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product mix  including our neoware e product which carries higher selling prices  higher gross profit dollars per unit sold  and lower percentage gross margins  and the possibility of increased price competition  increases or decreases in the cost of thin client devices  memory and other components  and increases in the cost of freight 
sales and marketing in thousands sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  commissions  advertising  direct marketing  the cost of trade shows and other costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts and beginning in fiscal  stock based compensation expense 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to million of stock based compensation expense  and an increase in employee headcount resulting in an additional million of employee compensation cost 
in addition  we spent  more in outside marketing services during fiscal  including expenses for consultants and advertising and promotion 
sales and marketing expenses declined as a percentage of revenue in fiscal versus fiscal as we primarily used our existing sales and marketing infrastructure to cover a larger customer base 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in fiscal we are planning to make significant investments to attract additional enterprise customers and gain market share 
these investments will include additions to the sales teams in the united states  europe and asia  as well as additional marketing personnel and programs designed to stimulate thin client awareness and lead generation 
spending levels in any one quarter will vary depending upon the timing of individual marketing initiatives 

back to index research and development in thousands research and development as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  and other engineering related costs and beginning in fiscal  stock based compensation expense 
the increase in research and development in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in employee headcount primarily from acquisitions resulting in an additional million of employee compensation costs and  related to the impact of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in staff levels  including additional personnel from acquisitions and a write off of  of acquisition related in process research and development 
we believe that a significant level of research and development investment is required to remain competitive and expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  to increase as a percentage of revenue in the beginning of fiscal  but to remain in the same range as fiscal as a percentage of revenues as revenues grow 
general and administrative in thousands general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  related benefits  corporate insurance  such as director and officer liability insurance  fees related to the costs of a public company and fees for legal  audit and tax services  and beginning in fiscal  stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily the result of million of stock based compensation expense  a  increase in franchise and capital stock taxes due to revenue and asset growth  a  increase in the bad debt expense primarily related to the insolvency of a european distributor   in higher facility costs due to the relocation into a new facility and increased costs related to managing a larger world wide organization  partially offset by a reduction of  in consulting services primarily due to lower third party consulting costs relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in staffing levels  increases in compensation levels and added costs for legal  accounting and compliance activities associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in staffing levels reflects additional personnel related to our organizational investments in executive management and other positions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  but decline slightly as a percentage of revenues as revenues grow 

back to index amortization of intangibles in thousands amortization of intangibles as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal and fiscal due to an increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions 
as of june   we had unamortized intangible assets in the net amount of million 
we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets to increase slightly in fiscal abandoned acquisition costs during fiscal  we wrote off million in acquisition related expenses which were previously deferred  related to acquisitions that were not consummated 
these costs consisted primarily of advisory  legal  third party due diligence and accounting fees 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and  if we do not complete them  the cost of pursing acquisitions will impact our profitability 
interest income in thousands interest income as a percentage of net revenues percentage change over prior period interest income is generated on cash  cash equivalent and investment balances generally invested in tax free  short term instruments 
interest income increased in fiscal due to earnings on increased cash and investments  generated primarily from the common stock offering completed in february and to a lesser extent cash from operations 
income taxes in thousands income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to the non deductible portion of stock based compensation related to sfas no 
r 
during fiscal  we benefited from the impact of federal tax free investment income  the extraterritorial income exclusion eie  the initial year impact of the manufacturing deduction for the jobs creation act and from foreign income taxes in lower tax rate countries 
the eie provides a tax benefit by excluding a portion of income from qualified foreign sales from gross income  however the benefit will be phased out at the end of calendar our effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the combined federal and state statutory rates due primarily to the tax benefit from the eie and to a lesser extent from foreign income taxes in lower tax rate countries 
we expect the effective income tax rate to decline in fiscal due to the full year impact of federal tax free investment income 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had net working capital of million 
our principal sources of liquidity include million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and an offering basis loan agreement with a bank under which we can request short term loan advances up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
upon such request  the bank would provide us with the interest rate  terms and conditions applicable to the requested loan advance
