inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout   and  thus increasing our cost of operations 
in addition to the increased fuel costs  the reduced fuel efficiency of the new engines has put additional pressure on profitability due to increased fuel consumption 
competitive conditions in the transportation industry  such as lower demand for transportation services  could affect the company s ability to obtain rate increases or fuel surcharges 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses

at december   the company has million shares remaining under the current board of director repurchase authorization 
future purchases are dependent upon market conditions 
management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs 
the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded by cash flow provided by operations and from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the company ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and no debt 
net working capital for the year ended december  increased by million over the improvement in net working capital helped mitigate the additional cash expenditure for income taxes and stock repurchases during based on the company s strong financial position  management believes outside financing could be obtained  if necessary  to fund capital expenditures

the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been established due to the profitability of the company s business 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period
