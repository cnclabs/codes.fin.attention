oil and gas marketing and major customers marketing 
our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our natural gas condensate is sold under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
our crude oil production is marketed to several purchasers based on short term contracts 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant

index to financial statements competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production will depend in part on the cost and availability of alternative fuels  the level of consumer demand  the extent of domestic production of oil and gas  the extent of importation of foreign oil and gas  the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities  regulations by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations 
employees at december  we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and our two field offices  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
nine of such full time employees are field personnel involved in oil and natural gas producing activities 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and well testing

regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and

index to financial statements ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the assessment of remedial obligations  and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose strict  joint and several liability on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
persons who are responsible for releases under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for remediation costs at the site  and may also be liable for natural resource damages 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  which imposes requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
the federal water pollution control act clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liability for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages arising from a spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the clean water act and opa requirements 
the federal clean air act  and comparable state laws  regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
in addition  epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements 
state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
item a 
risk factors our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
these factors include the following our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by independent reserve engineers and were calculated using oil and gas prices as of december  these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed at the end of reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculation our pre tax pv value  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  and low prices have had in the past and could have in the future a material adverse impact on our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 
average oil and natural gas prices increased substantially from to  from to and during we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
reductions in oil and natural gas prices not only reduce revenues and profits  but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
significant declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changing commodity prices and we have hedged a targeted portion of our anticipated production for through our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our financial derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
for the years ended december   and  we realized a loss on settled financial derivatives of million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million in for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the amount of million 
this loss and gain were recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed to be ineffective for and for the fourth quarter of  and accordingly  the changes in fair value of such hedges could no longer be reflected in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that the hedges are not deemed to be effective in the future  we will likewise be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our hedges 

table of contents 
index to financial statements delays in development or production curtailment affecting our material properties may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
the size of our operations and our capital expenditure budget limits the number of wells that we can develop in any given year 
complications in the development of any single material well may result in a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a relatively small number of wells contribute a substantial portion of our production 
if we were to experience operational problems resulting in the curtailment of production in any of these wells  our total production levels would be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  such as the lafitte field  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
we may have difficulty financing our planned growth 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs  particularly as a result of our drilling program 
in the future  we expect that we will require additional financing  in addition to cash generated from operations  to fund planned growth 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
if we are not able to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  it may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments of million  and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a geographic area 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december  and a similar percentage of our production during were associated with our cotton valley trend and south louisiana properties 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
our oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration  development and production activities  including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire properties and to drill exploratory wells 
in conducting exploration and development activities  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration  development and production activities to be unsuccessful 
this could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs would be charged against earnings as impairments 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility and our second lien term loan contain customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our credit facility and term loan 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our credit facility and term loan 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that we created 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us are subject to extensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
in addition  our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business 
joint and several strict liability may be incurred in connection with discharges or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on  under or from our properties and from facilities where our wastes have been taken for disposal 
private parties affected by such discharges or releases may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
some of our operations are exposed to the additional risk of tropical weather disturbances 
some of our production and reserves are located in south louisiana 
operations in this area are subject to tropical weather disturbances 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
for example  hurricanes katrina and rita impacted our south louisiana operations in the third quarter of causing the shut in of our burrwood west delta and lafitte fields in late august and the shut in of our second bayou field in late september 
we estimate that approximately  and  mcfe per day of net production for the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  was shut in as a result of the hurricanes 
the fourth quarter amount represents of pre hurricane south louisiana production volumes 
as of december   we had restored approximately of our pre hurricane volumes in south louisiana  with the remaining pre hurricane production volumes being temporarily shut in awaiting completion of facility and well repairs 
damage to our facilities due to the two hurricanes was substantially covered by insurance 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks 
for more information on the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on our operations  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the terrorist attacks on september  and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the cotton valley trend of east texas and northwest louisiana and in the transition zone of south louisiana 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we own working interests in active oil and gas wells located in fields in three states 
at december   we had estimated proved reserves of approximately mmbbls of oil and condensate and bcf of natural gas  or an aggregate of bcfe with a pre tax present value of future net cash flows  discounted at  of million and an after tax present value of discounted future net cash flows of million 
see items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserves for a reconciliation to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production  on a cost effective basis  are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company such as us 
management strives to increase our oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through a balanced program of capital expenditures involving acquisition  exploitation and exploration activities 
we generally do not make capital commitments beyond one year 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our internally generated operating cash flow in managing our business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in our statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income 
our revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control  however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
as further described under results of operations below  we achieved significant increases in oil and gas production volumes and operating cash flows in the years ended december  and these trends largely reflect the results of our successful drilling program as we increased our capital expenditures from million in to million in and million in we also benefited from strong commodity pricing environments in  and

index to financial statements impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast region of the united states passing directly over our burrwood west delta field causing damage to one producing well norton and our onshore and offshore facilities in the field 
as of december   we estimated that the gross damage costs to the norton well were approximately million and that the gross damage costs to the various facilities were approximately million 
these amounts are current estimates and are subject to change as we complete our damage assessment and complete our insurance claims 
the net book value of the norton well at such time was treated as a partial abandonment and removed from the amortization base with no gain or loss being recognized 
we have an approximate working interest in most of the burrwood west delta field and two other working interest owners own the remaining our interest in certain wells is less than due to additional working interest owners 
all working interest owners participate jointly with us in the insurance coverage 
therefore  we and the other working interest owners will share proportionately in the allocation of the deductible amount as well as in the allocation of the insurance proceeds that are ultimately received 
we anticipate all but approximately of the costs incurred and remaining to be incurred from hurricane katrina to be reimbursed from insurance proceeds 
this amount represents a net exposure to us of approximately million 
on september   hurricane rita also struck the gulf coast  passing over our second bayou field in southwest louisiana  causing damage to some facilities but to none of the producing wells 
as of december   we estimated that the gross damage costs to the facilities were approximately million 
we have an average working interest in the second bayou field 
our other working interest owners  who own the remaining working interest  also participate jointly with us in the insurance coverage and will therefore share proportionately in the allocation of the deductible amount as well as in the allocation of the insurance proceeds that are ultimately received 
we anticipate approximately of the costs incurred and remaining to be incurred from hurricane rita to be reimbursed from insurance proceeds

results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  oil and gas sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a increase in oil and gas production volumes  due to a substantial increase in cotton valley trend production  as well as higher average oil and gas prices 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in south louisiana production  due to natural decline and the effects of shut ins due to the hurricanes

liquidity and capital resources cash flows operating activities 
cash flow from operations is dependent upon our ability to increase production through development  exploration and acquisition activities and the price of oil and natural gas 
our cash flow from operations also is impacted by changes in working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million  up from million in and up from million in the increases in and were a result of the increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and production levels in compared to and  partially offset by increases in lease operating expenses  exploration expenses and general and administrative expenses

cotton valley trend in the first quarter of  we commenced what we believe is a relatively low risk drilling program which was initially focused on operated acreage in the cotton valley trend in and around rusk and panola counties  texas  and desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana 
we have increased our acreage position from approximately  gross acres at december  to  gross acres as of february  this amount reflects a non operated working interest in approximately  gross acres in angelina and nacogdoches counties  texas  which we acquired in august as of the same date  we have drilled and or completed cotton valley wells with a success rate 
our net production volumes from our cotton valley trend wells aggregated approximately  mcfe of gas per day in the fourth quarter of  or approximately of our total oil and gas production in the period 
in east texas  we began leasing acreage in the first quarter of and commenced a drilling program in april as of february   we had drilled and completed a total of successful wells in east texas on our operated acreage targeting the cotton valley formation 
we have an average working interest of approximately in the wells drilled and completed on our operated acreage to date 
in december  we completed drilling an initial exploratory well on our non operated acreage in nacogdoches county  in which we have a working interest 
in northwest louisiana  we commenced a drilling program targeting the cotton valley formation in the first quarter of and have completed seven cotton valley wells as of february  our initiative in this area began in the third quarter of  when we obtained  via farmout  exploration rights to approximately  gross acres in the bethany longstreet field 
we retain continuous drilling rights to the entire block so long as we drill at least one well within days from previous operations 
for each productive well drilled under the agreement  we earn an assignment to acres

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in these financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
application of certain of our accounting policies requires a significant amount of estimates 
these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 

table of contents 
index to financial statements successful efforts accounting we utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
impairment of properties we continually monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
asset retirement obligations we are required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties 
this requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
as of december  and in certain prior years  we have reported a net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet  after deduction of the related valuation allowance  which has been determined on the basis of management s estimation of the likelihood of realization of the gross deferred tax asset as a deduction against future taxable income 
derivative instruments as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage both our commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we consider the use of these instruments to be hedging activities 
pursuant to derivative accounting rules  we are required to use mark to market accounting to reflect the fair value of such derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that we are able to demonstrate that our use of derivative instruments qualifies as hedging activities  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value of these instruments is accounted for in other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that such derivatives are deemed to be ineffective  as was the case in and the fourth quarter of with respect to our gas hedges  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value is reflected in earnings 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at the inception of each hedge  we document that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
a hedge must be determined to be highly effective under accounting rules in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
this assessment  which is updated quarterly  includes an evaluation of the most recent historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
in this analysis  changes in monthly settlement prices on our oil and gas derivatives are compared with the change in physical daily indexed prices that we receive from the field purchasers for our oil and gas production designated for hedging 
commencing with the fourth quarter of and during  the analysis demonstrated that the natural gas swaps were not considered highly effective under sfas as a result  they ceased to qualify for hedge accounting treatment and the changes in fair value of the hedged instrument were recognized in earnings 
price volatility within a measured month is the primary factor affecting the analysis of effectiveness of our oil and natural gas swaps 
volatility can reduce the correlation between the hedge settlement price and the price received for physical deliveries 
secondary factors contributing to changes in pricing differentials include changes in the basis differential which is the difference in the locally indexed price received for daily physical deliveries of hedged quantities and the index price used in hedge settlement  and changes in grade and quality factors of the hedged oil and natural gas production which would further impact the price received for physical deliveries 
not withstanding the recent determination that our natural gas swaps were not deemed highly effective for purposes of applicable accounting rules  management continues to believe that our oil and gas price hedge strategy has been effective in satisfying our financial objective of providing cash flow stability 
our hedge agreements currently consist of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex quoted prices  and b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk despite the measures taken by us to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic crude oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
we enter into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
we consider these agreements to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in our crude oil and natural gas sales 
our strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to generally hedge between and of our production 
as of december   the commodity hedges we utilized were in the form of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex quoted prices  and b collars

our hedging contracts fall within our targeted range of to of our estimated net oil and gas production volumes for the applicable periods of the fair value of the crude oil and natural gas hedging contracts in place at december  resulted in a liability of million 
based on oil and gas pricing in effect at december   a hypothetical increase in oil and gas prices would have increased the derivative liability to million while a hypothetical decrease in oil and gas prices would have decreased the derivative liability to an asset of million 
interest rate risk we have a variable rate debt obligation that exposes us to the effects of changes in interest rates 
to partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
at december  we had the following interest rate swaps in place with bnp in millions

cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimates and such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
