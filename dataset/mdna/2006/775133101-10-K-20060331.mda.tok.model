item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k 
business overview rogers corporation is a global enterprise that provides its customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets that include portable communications devices  communications infrastructure  computer and office equipment  ground transportation  aerospace and defense  and consumer markets 
the company generates revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacturing  and distribution of specialty material based products and components that are sold to multiple customers  primarily original equipment manufacturers oem s and contract manufacturers  that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to end customers for use in various applications 
as such  rogers business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these end user products 
the company s ability to forecast future sales growth is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how the company s customers will react to these changing conditions  it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by the company s customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  the company s sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on net sales 
the company s current focus is on worldwide markets that have an increasing percentage of materials being used to support growing high technology applications  such as cellular base stations and antennas  handheld wireless devices  satellite television receivers  hard disk drives and automotive electronics 
the company continues to focus on business opportunities around the globe and particularly in the asian marketplace  as evidenced by the continued investment in and expansion of its manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china  which serve as the company s manufacturing base to serve its customers in asia 
in  the company focused on gaining operational improvements in its floats and elastomer component businesses  which were relocated from connecticut to china in  as well as adding additional capacity to allow for production of electroluminescent lamps and busbars  which came on line in the fourth quarter of the company has plans to further expand its campus in china and plans to add additional lamp capacity  as well as to add capacity for future production of other product lines in asia  such as high frequency materials 
from a process improvement standpoint  the company continues to focus on its six sigma initiatives  as it plans to increase employee participation in this effort in by training more green belts and project champions 
six sigma is a quantitative process improvement methodology used by the company to help streamline and improve its processes from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service 
the company continuously has projects in progress as it is focused on gaining both operational and transactional efficiencies as a result of its six sigma efforts 
since inception of the initiative in  the company s estimated cost savings and value creation has been greater than two times its investment 
was a year of transition for rogers  as the company began to recognize significant operational improvements in the second half of the year as a result of the maturation of several strategic initiatives that were previously undertaken to better position the company in the global marketplace 
for example  in and the first half of  the company invested in expanding its manufacturing facility in china to add capacity for electroluminescent lamp and busbar production 
as with any new manufacturing process  the company experienced growing pains associated with the start up of production in early  particularly in the lamp business  as yields suffered and manufacturing processes had to be improved to meet customer needs 
late in  and particularly in the fourth quarter  the efforts made by the company throughout the year to improve the various production processes yielded more favorable operating results for the company  including yield improvements that resulted in an increase in sales and profits 
for the full year  net sales were million as compared to million in  however  sales were relatively flat in the first three quarters of million  million and million in the first  second and third quarters of  respectively  but increased dramatically in the fourth quarter to million  primarily due to the impact of some of the strategic initiatives previously described as these sales levels would not have been attainable absent these initiatives 
also in  the company experienced record sales in its foam business  particularly in its flagship poron urethane foam line  and continued strong performance in its high frequency materials products 
in the second quarter of  the company took additional actions in an effort to further position itself for future operational efficiencies by restructuring its polyolefin foam business as it became apparent to the company that this business would not become profitable under current market conditions  particularly due to increasing raw material prices and the existing product pricing structure 
therefore  the company shed many of its unprofitable customers and began to realize a positive financial impact from this transition in the third quarter of rogers management team believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of the significant market opportunities available to it as it moves into and has already experienced some of this positive impact in the fourth quarter of the efforts the company has made in the last few years to establish and expand production in china to enable it to have manufacturing close to its customers  to restructure certain businesses to better align with the company s strategic vision  and to invest in research and development  have all laid the foundation for the growth of rogers in and beyond 
rogers is continuously working to be the supplier of choice for the specialty materials based products it produces and will continue to invest generously in research and development to maintain that market leadership position 
the company is focused on current growing markets and new emerging markets and will continue to invest in the highest quality human capital to position itself to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace 
rogers believes that its technology and ongoing investment in research and development gives the company its greatest competitive advantage and will work to keep and grow its intellectual property to maintain its position in the markets in which it participates 
based on all these factors  the company believes it is in a position to experience record results in  however  as with any business  the company s sales volumes are impacted and can swing significantly based on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to end user market trends  the activities of suppliers and competitors  availability of raw materials  commercial success of new products  and market development activities 
also  see risk factors in item a 
of this form k 
the company has experienced recent upturns and downturns in its various businesses due to these varied factors and  while the company has projected sales volumes for resource planning and strategic considerations  the company anticipates these factors will continue to impact actual results and its ability to accurately forecast and plan resources and initiatives accordingly 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
restated restated net sales manufacturing margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating profit equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income income before income taxes income taxes net income vs 
net sales net sales decreased by in to million from the record sales experienced in of million 
the decline in sales is primarily due to a decline in sales in the printed circuit materials reportable segment from million in to million in  as well as a decline in sales of the company s other polymer products reportable segment from million in to million in these sales declines were partially mitigated by a increase in sales of the high performance foams reportable segment from million to million and an increase in the custom electrical components reportable segment of from million in to million in these sales fluctuations are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased approximately basis points to in from in the decline in margins is primarily attributable to a decline of percentage points in margins in the custom electrical components reportable segment due primarily to the start up of operations in asia in both the electroluminescent lamp and busbar operations 
margins related to electroluminescent lamps were below expected levels  particularly in the beginning of  as this was the first time the company had manufactured this type of lamp using its new technology 
as a result  yields were low as the company worked to improve production results as a result of the learning curve typically associated with the introduction of a new product 
at the end of  margins had improved substantially on these lamps  both in the us and in asia  although not enough to compensate for the unfavorable results experienced in the beginning of the year 
partially mitigating this negative impact was a basis point increase in margins in the high performance foams reportable segment  driven primarily by operating efficiencies gained in the silicone product line as margins of polyurethane foams remained consistent with results 
margins in the printed circuit materials reportable segment were relatively flat year over year and margins in the other polymer products reportable segment were also materially consistent in as compared to selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses of million in were consistent with expenditures in and increased slightly as a percentage of sales from in to in the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is due primarily to the sales decline in as compared to as expenses remained consistent with spending levels 
research and development expenses research and development expenses remained relatively consistent in as compared to  decreasing slightly from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses increased slightly in to as compared to in the company s strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
the company continues to invest in research and development to improve its existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that the company believes will complement its existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in charges included million related to the impairment of certain assets of the polyolefin foam business and million in charges related to the impairment of certain machinery and equipment associated with the company s high frequency materials business 
charges were comprised of approximately million due to the relocation of the company s elastomer component business from connecticut to china and million related to severance charges for certain employees of the company s durel division 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows polyolefin foams the company acquired certain assets of the polyolefin foam business  including intellectual property rights  inventory  machinery and equipment  and customer lists from cellect llc  in the beginning of fiscal year the company migrated the manufacturing process to its carol stream  illinois facility  which was completed at the end of the third quarter of this migration included the development of new process technology and the purchase of custom machinery  which the company believed at the time would allow it to gain efficiencies in the manufacturing process and improvements in product quality 
after completing this transition  the company focused on realizing these previously anticipated efficiencies and improvements  but encountered a variety of business issues  including changing customer requirements in the polyolefin marketplace  a significant increase in raw material costs  and other quality and delivery issues 
in light of these circumstances  the company commenced a study in the first quarter of to update its market understanding and the long term viability of the polyolefin foam business 
this study was completed in the second quarter of and confirmed that the business environment surrounding the polyolefin foam business had changed from the time of the company s initial purchase  which caused the company to revisit its business plan for the polyolefin foam business 
the company concluded during the second quarter that under the new circumstances it would be very difficult and cost prohibitive to produce the current polyolefin products on a profitable basis and decided to scale back on the current business by shedding unprofitable customers and to concentrate on developing new  more profitable polyolefin products 
as a result  the company recorded non cash pre tax charges of million related to the polyolefin foam operating segment  which is aggregated in the company s other polymer products reportable segment 
this charge includes a million impairment charge on certain long lived assets and million in charges related to the write down of inventory and receivables related to the polyolefin foam business 
high frequency materials also in  an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter on certain manufacturing equipment related to the high frequency materials operating segment 
specifically  the charge relates to certain idle presses used in the high frequency manufacturing processes 
at the end of  the company had no current plan to use the equipment in the near future  therefore  it determined that recording the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was appropriate 
south windham facility on january   the company announced that it would cease operations at its south windham  connecticut facility by the end of the relocation of manufacturing operations of the company s molded polyurethane materials and nitrile rubber floats to the company s facility in suzhou  china was completed in the third quarter of total charges associated with this transaction amounted to approximately million related primarily to severance that was paid to employees upon termination and completion of service requirements 
in addition  the company recognized a million curtailment charge on its defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of as a result of the termination of employees as the amortizable prior service cost related to terminated employees was accelerated into as a result of the shutdown 
durel on october   the company announced a restructuring plan that resulted in a headcount reduction at durel 
the terminations occurred early in the fourth quarter of and  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the company recognized approximately  in charges associated with related severance amounts due to eligible employees 
all amounts have been paid as of year end equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the start up of operations at the company s new foam joint venture in china  ris 
operations for ris began in late and did not become profitable until late  thus mitigating the positive operating results experienced at the company s other joint ventures  rcct and ric 
the company expects joint venture performance in to be strong and is encouraged by the strong operating performance of ris in the fourth quarter of other income expense other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is attributable primarily to the following factors i a decrease of approximately million in royalty income as a royalty agreement that was entered into when the company divested its moldable composites division in comes to an end as payments associated with this agreement decline over the life of the agreement  ii million gain on the sale of a building in arizona in  iii million charge in to accrue for certain environmental remediation matters at the company s facility in south windham  connecticut  and iv million charge in related to the buy out of certain tenant lease arrangements in the company s suzhou  china facilities 
also  the company experienced an increase in professional service fees of million  particularly related to legal fees associated with certain legal and professional matters  including asbestos related matters 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in and in in  the effective tax rate benefited from non taxable foreign sales income percentage point reduction  profits generated in jurisdictions with low tax rates percentage point reduction as well as an adjustment to reconcile the tax return as filed in the third quarter of to the year end projections percentage point reduction 
also in  as in  the effective tax rate continued to benefit from foreign tax credits percentage point reduction and general business credits percentage point reduction 
it is the company s policy that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
the company provides deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of its japanese high performance foams joint venture 
the net deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits available in excess of the expected tax on the undistributed income is entirely offset by a corresponding valuation allowance due to the future uncertainty of the recognition of such credits as they may be limited under the us tax code 
the company also claims a us benefit for nontaxable foreign sales income as allowed under the current extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
the world trade organization has upheld a challenge of this regime by the european union and in response the us has enacted the american jobs creation act of that repealed eti and created a manufacturers activity deduction 
eti will be phased out by limiting the calculated deduction to in  in and thereafter 
the manufacturing deduction is in the process of being phased in as a deduction on the income from certain qualifying activities in to a deduction in the company has determined that the net effect of these items will not materially affect the tax rate in the short term  but may have an impact  given the nature of the company s international business  once these changes are fully phased in 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to eti is percentage points and percentage points for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to the manufacturers activity deduction is percentage points for  the first year it is in effect 
the company is eligible for a tax holiday on its earnings in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations are taxed at a zero percent tax rate 
in  the first year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to the zero percent tax rate  resulting in a decrease in the company s effective tax rate of percentage points  or in diluted earnings per share 
in years through of the tax holiday the tax rate in effect is and in year and beyond  the tax rate is  subject to local government approval 
backlog the company s backlog of firm orders was million at year end  as compared to million at january  the increase in is due primarily to orders related to the printed circuit materials reportable segment  as backlog increased by almost million at year end as compared to year end due to the increase in orders in certain markets  particularly satellite television and communications 
vs 
net sales net sales increased by in to million from million in the record sales level experienced by the company in was driven by the strong sales performance at each of the company s reportable segments printed circuit materials sales increased by in to million from million in  high performance foams sales increased from million in to million in  or  sales in the custom electrical components segment increased by from million in to million in due in part to the inclusion of a full year of sales for durel in million as compared to the fourth quarter of of million  as rogers acquired durel at the end of the third quarter of  sales in the other polymer products segment increased slightly from million in to million in see segment sales and operations section below for further discussion of segment sales performance 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased approximately basis points to in from in the decline in margins is attributable to several factors  including costs specifically associated with the transition of manufacturing of the company s polyolefin product line to its new facility in carol stream  illinois  caused overall company margins to decline by approximately basis points in the company has experienced a cumulative manufacturing loss to date in this business as it continues to work to improve efficiencies and yields in the manufacturing process and develop new product platforms for which the technology was acquired 
margins at the durel division declined by approximately percentage points in as compared to as full year sales decreased by almost year over year 
the margin decline is attributable to several key programs reaching end of life and high levels of start up costs associated with the ramp up of production of its new flexible lamp keypad applications 
these unfavorable margin items were partially offset by a basis point increase in margins in the urethane and silicone foams business due to the company s ability to leverage its existing overhead base  as sales for this business increased by as compared to the prior year 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  but declined as a percentage of net sales from in to in factors impacting selling and administrative expenses include i the inclusion of a full year of expenses from durel versus only one quarter of expenses in million incremental impact  ii incrementally higher incentive compensation and sales commission expenses of million  which are commensurate with higher sales and profit volumes experienced in as compared to  iii incrementally higher benefit costs of million as the costs of medical  pension  postretirement and other fringe benefit costs increased in  iv consulting and audit fees associated with the company s sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  which increased approximately million in as compared to  and v a million incremental increase in expenses associated with other consulting and professional services utilized by the company in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to in from in this improvement is attributable to the record sales volumes the company experienced in  partially mitigated by the increased costs discussed above 
the company manages its selling and administrative expenses in an effort to achieve a relatively stable level of costs in relation to its sales volumes  with a targeted percentage of 
the company recognizes the challenges associated with this target  particularly as it continues to expand in asia and as it works to meet the expanding regulatory requirements in the current environment in which it operates 
research and development research and development expenses increased million in to million from million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were the same as at 
the company s strategic plan is to invest an average of of sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
expenses included a full year of expenses for durel  which contributed approximately million over spending levels 
the company has also invested significantly in printed circuit material development  focusing on next generation printed circuit materials to expand the company s product portfolio and build on its strong market position in applications such as mobile phone handsets  and in polyolefin foams in order to develop differentiated products to generate higher sales margins 
equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of durel  the company s former joint venture  and its inclusion in the company s consolidated results beginning in the fourth quarter of equity income included for durel in was approximately million 
equity income from the company s joint ventures other than durel increased by million in this increase was driven by the strong performances of rcct and ric  where equity income increased by million and million  respectively  partially offset by a million equity loss from ris  which began operations in the second half of the operations and performance of the joint ventures are described further in the joint ventures section below 
other income less other charges other income less other charges decreased from million in to million in the main components that affected this change are as follows i a million decrease in commission income from its joint venture  pls  as activity between the joint venture and its sole customer decreased in due to its sole customer implementing a dual sourcing strategy  ii a million charge for the disposition or sale of certain assets associated with the move of its elastomer components production from connecticut to china  iii a million reduction of royalty income in  primarily related to a royalty the company receives as a result of the sale of its moldable composites business in  iv a million gain on the sale of an idle building in chandler  arizona  and v a million gain on the realization of life insurance policies for one of the company s former executives 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in and in in  as in  the effective tax rate continued to benefit from foreign tax credits percentage point reduction  general business credits percentage point reduction  and nontaxable foreign sales income percentage point reduction 
the company had used the equity method of accounting for the profit and loss of its ownership of durel corporation prior to september  a deferred tax liability was provided on historical earnings annually 
prior to the acquisition by the company of the remaining of durel s stock  durel  as anticipated  paid a million dividend to the company that qualified for the dividend received deduction benefit 
therefore  of the dividend was not subject to us tax and the corresponding deferred tax liability for the distribution of equity was eliminated  resulting in a net tax benefit of  also  in conjunction with the acquisition accounting for the purchase  the remaining deferred tax liability for the undistributed earnings of durel was accounted for as a decrease to goodwill as the deferred tax liability was no longer required 
it is the company s policy that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
the company provides deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of its japanese high performance foams joint venture 
the net deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits available in excess of the expected tax on the undistributed income is entirely offset by a corresponding valuation allowance due to the future uncertainty of the recognition of such credits as they may be limited under the us tax code 
the company also claims a us benefit for nontaxable foreign sales income as allowed under the current extraterritorial income exclusion eti 
the world trade organization has upheld a challenge of this regime by the european union and in response the us has enacted the american jobs creation act of that repealed eti and created a manufacturers activity deduction 
eti will be phased out by limiting the calculated deduction to in  in and thereafter 
the manufacturing deduction is in the process of being phased in as a deduction on the income from certain qualifying activities in to a deduction in the company has determined that the net effect of these items will not materially effect the tax rate in the short term  but may have an impact  given the nature of the company s international business  once these changes are fully phased in 
the decrease in the effective tax rate attributable to eti is percentage points and percentage points for and  respectively 
backlog the company s backlog of firm orders was million at january  and million at december  the decrease in is due primarily to the sequential softening of sales in flexible circuit material products million decrease and at durel million decrease 
segment sales and operations printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income sales in the printed circuit materials reportable segment declined by in as compared to its record sales year in  in which it experienced an increase in sales of from this decline in sales during is attributable to the softening of the flexible circuit materials business  which experienced a decline in sales of in as compared to  a record sales year with a sales increase of over from the softening in flexible circuit material sales was driven primarily by the end of life of certain cell phone programs that drove the record sales levels in as the company struggled to keep up with the volume levels demanded in  it did not get designed into equivalent new programs in  therefore  when the programs that drove the sales levels in ended  there were an inadequate amount of new programs to make up for the volume short fall 
the impact of this occurrence was further magnified by the fact that the sales growth in was driven by a relatively small number of programs that experienced unexpected high demand in the cell phone marketplace 
in the future  the company is focusing on expanding its product portfolio in the flex materials business to mitigate these types of situations and the impact such program shifts would have on the business 
sales of the company s high frequency materials remained relatively flat as compared to and continued to be a strong contributor to the company s operating results as sales into the communications infrastructure and satellite television markets remained strong throughout the year 
operating income  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in as compared to in and in the primary driver of this decline was sales volume in the flex business as the company was able to leverage its existing overhead structure to drive profit performance in  while having to absorb these additional costs at lower volume levels in high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income high performance foams reportable segment net sales increased in as compared to and in as compared to the sales increase is attributable to the continued growth in poron urethane foam product sales  which increased in as compared to and in as compared to the urethane foam products sales increase in was primarily driven by growth in industrial and consumer applications  particularly in portable communications  electronics  athletic footwear  healthcare  and general industrial applications 
regionally  the greatest growth of urethane foams sales was again in china  though north america and europe also grew during the year 
sales of silicone foams remained relatively consistent in as compared to  a year in which sales grew as compared to the company believes that the increase in sales for silicones was primarily a result of business cycles in its core applications areas  which include ground transportation  aerospace  communications infrastructure and general industrial applications 
operating income  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in as compared to in and in the growth in these figures is primarily attributable to the increases in sales volumes as the company is able to better leverage its overhead base to maximize returns in this segment 
custom electrical components dollars in millions net sales operating income loss net sales of the custom electrical components reportable segment increased in as compared to and as compared to the large increase in sales in is mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of durel sales million as compared to only the fourth quarter sales in million  as durel was acquired in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales was driven primarily by sales of electroluminescent el lamps into the portable handheld communication device market  particularly in cell phone applications 
much of the sales growth is attributable to expansion in china that enabled the company to increase its el lamp manufacturing capacity to meet current market demand and drove sales growth  particularly towards the end of the company expects the el lamp business to continue to grow in sales of the company s busbar products increased by in as compared to and in as compared to the significant increase experienced in stemmed in large part from foreign currency fluctuations  as the dollar weakened significantly as compared to the euro 
excluding the currency impact  the increase in sales in from was approximately  which was driven by continued success in the electrical traction market  as well as the successful launch of a new project in the information technology market 
in  the company added capacity in china for busbar production and expects that this additional capacity will help serve its asian customers in the electrical traction market and contribute to sales growth in operating income loss  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in as compared to in and in this decline is due primarily to sales mix in the segment  as higher margin inverter sales have dropped significantly since and lower margin el lamp sales have grown  as well as expenditures for capacity expansion in china for both el lamps and busbars 
also  was the first year for el lamp production and  similar to many new products  the company experienced certain issues related to the start up of manufacturing of this product  such as low yields 
towards the end of  the company had worked through most of the el lamp quality issues 
the company also expects that its investment in capacity expansion in china will begin to contribute positively to operations in  as it experienced some favorable results as a result of this expansion at the end of other polymer products dollars in millions net sales operating loss the company s other polymer products reportable segment includes elastomer components and floats  composite materials  industrial laminates  and polyolefin foams 
the sales decline in is attributable to two primary factors i the restructuring of the polyolefin foam business in the second quarter of and ii the decline in sales of elastomer components of in as compared to  as compared to a increase in as compared to the sales declines and operating loss in is primarily due to the restructuring of the polyolefin operating segment  as sales declined approximately in as compared to and a million non cash charge was recorded in related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and the write down of inventory and receivables within the polyolefin foam operation 
see restructuring and impairment charges above for further discussion 
operating loss  excluding the million restructuring charge  was million  which is slightly better than the million loss sustained in results for polyolefins  net of the impairment charge  improved slightly as compared to as a result of the restructuring 
in  the company relocated the manufacturing operations of its elastomer component and float businesses to china from connecticut 
as a result of the move  customers ordered excess inventory to compensate for the disruption in manufacturing production  which contributed to the increase in sales in in  this business struggled to gain traction as it worked through start up issues with the new production lines in china and focused on working to reduce significant backlog once the production lines were functional 
the company caught up on this backlog in and is now re focused on growing and expanding the business in the asian marketplace 
joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  the company s joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales increased from to and from to the large increase experienced in was driven by a number of application wins resulting in market share growth in various industrial markets  including cell phones and automotive  and the increased adoptions of poron urethane foam materials into the consumer electronics market 
the joint venture was able to sustain this increased sales level in rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  the company s joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit material for customers in taiwan 
the joint venture experienced its first sales in and became profitable in sales in increased by over and by over in as compared to this increase was due to significant application wins late in in the taiwan market that substantially drove sales growth in the company expects some growth in in these markets  although not at the pace experienced in or polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  the company s joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sells adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
sales increased by in as compared to after decreasing in as compared to sales increased in as orders from the joint venture s sole customer increased due to higher market demand for its products 
the sales levels were achieved despite a decision in by its sole customer to allocate a portion of the trace suspension product business to multiple suppliers to mitigate its risk of reliance on a sole supplier 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris in  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china 
ris began operations during the second half of and had its first sales in the fourth quarter of activity at ris in was minimal and did not materially impact the company s results of operations 
operations did not begin to increase until late in  as ris worked through several start up issues that impeded its anticipated progress 
in the fourth quarter of  ris experienced its first significant sales volumes and became profitable 
the company expects this positive trend to continue into product and market development the company s research and development team is dedicated to growing the company s businesses by developing cost effective solutions that improve the performance of customers products 
research and development as a percentage of sales was approximately in  as compared to in and the company introduced a variety of new products during printed circuit materials added two new ro products  one that enhances the performance of base station antennas and one that improves the performance of new generation of satellite dishes capable of providing more high definition television hdtv channels 
two flexible circuit materials products were also introduced which allow customers to manufacture products that are more environmentally friendly 
new foam products included a poron soft seal product that provides a tight  low force seal for the new generation of thinner handheld devices and new versions of r bak tapes were also added to improve flexographic print quality 
new electroluminescent lamp products included a combination of el lamps with force sensitive resistors to provide thin  attractive input devices for automotive as well as handheld electronic applications 
keypad lamps with improved toughness were also developed for use in handheld electronic applications 
acquisitions and divestitures in the first quarter of  the company acquired kf inc kf  a korean manufacturer of liquid level sensing devices for the automotive market  through a stock purchase agreement for approximately million 
under the terms of the agreement  kf has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and was included in its consolidated results beginning in the first quarter of the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  the purchase price was allocated to assets and liabilities based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position rogers management believes that the company s ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in the business is one of its fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by the company s financial position remaining strong throughout the company has remained debt free since and continues to finance its operational needs through internally generated funds 
management believes that over the next twelve months  internally generated funds plus available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditures and ongoing financial needs of the business 
however  the company continually reviews and evaluates the adequacy of its lending facilities and relationships 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at january  and january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  and working capital of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in significant items that impacted operating cash flows included the following a decrease in inventories of million in as compared to an increase of million in and a slight increase of million in the decrease was driven by the company s focus on working down the inventory levels that were increased in to meet customer demands 
the company was able to achieve this reduction through increased production in china  which reduced lead times and inventory on hand related to its asian customers 
an impairment charge related to the polyolefin foam business of million  which decreased receivables and inventory by million in the aggregate and certain intangible assets and fixed assets by million and million  respectively see footnote for further discussion 
this charge also caused a reduction in deferred taxes of approximately million  resulting in a net charge to income of million 
an increase in accounts receivable in of million as compared to an increase of million in and million in these increases are primarily attributable to the company s strong sales growth in the past three years 
in  sales in the fourth quarter were particularly strong  resulting in a significant increase in receivables at year end 
during  the company used million in cash for investing activities  as compared to million in and million in capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital spending in was driven by the company s continuing investment in china  as the company placed manufacturing capacity for its electroluminescent lamps and busbar products in its campus in suzhou 
cash generated from the company s operating activities exceeded capital spending in all three years  and spending was financed through these internally generated funds

this agreement expires on december  the rate of interest charged on outstanding loans can  at the company s option and subject to certain restrictions  be based on the prime rate or at rates from to basis points over a eurocurrency loan rate 
the spreads over the eurocurrency rate are based on the company s leverage ratio 
under the arrangement  the ongoing commitment fee varies from to basis points of the maximum amount that can be borrowed  net of any outstanding borrowings and the maximum amount that beneficiaries may draw under outstanding letters of credit 
there were no borrowings pursuant to this arrangement at january  and january  the loan agreement contains restrictive covenants primarily related to total indebtedness  interest expense  capital expenditures and net worth 
the company is in compliance with these covenants 
additionally  the company was obligated under irrevocable standby letters of credit  which guarantee the company s self insured workers compensation plan in the amount of million at january  there were no amounts outstanding pursuant to this agreement as of january  financial position the following discusses the significant fluctuations on the company s balance sheet at january  as compared to january  decrease in inventories of as the company continued to focus on reducing its inventory levels and succeeded  in part  due to the fact that more inventory was being manufactured in china to sell to its asian customers  as opposed to servicing those customers from the us  which would increase lead times and inventory on hand levels 
decrease in property  plant and equipment of and intangible assets of almost  primarily due to the polyolefin impairment charge  which resulted in a write down of fixed assets of approximately million and a reduction to intangible assets of approximately million during decrease in accrued employee benefits and compensation of primarily due to the absence of accrued incentive compensation in as the company did not reach its targeted financial performance goals for the year 
decrease in additional paid in capital of as a result of the stock buyback program

recent accounting standards stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r was initially effective for periods beginning after june   however  in april of  the sec delayed the effective date to the annual period that begins after june  the company expects to adopt the modified prospective approach in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
therefore  the company will begin to recognize stock based compensation expense under sfas r in the first quarter of inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is therefore required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company has determined that this pronouncement will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
accounting changes and error corrections in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections that requires entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting changes 
sfas applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believes that appropriate reserves have been established that are based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances known to the company  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used  or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows environmental and product liabilities the company accrues for its environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prp s  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
the company is exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
in late  the company determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to it at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine its potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  the company s limited claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  the company believes that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  the company also believes that its ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required the company to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
the company believes the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of its asbestos litigation 
the original liability model determined the company s future liability annually for a year period and was updated at the end of the company believes  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to it  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify its liability is years  resulting in a liability at january  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if the company were to adjust its assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from years to years would be an increase to the liability of million  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from years to years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  the company plans to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and the company will update them if needed based on the company s experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that the company s accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate its actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that its accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that it will incur additional charges for its asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot estimate such excess amounts at this time 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements 
the company is subject to income taxes in the untied states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax position as well as its effective tax rate 
although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of certain transactions and tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
inventory allowances the company maintains a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
the company s obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a basis point adjustment to the obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and or if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may have been impaired 
the company reviews intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
determining the fair value of an operating segment or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
the company believes that the assumptions and rates used in its annual impairment test under sfas are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the company s respective operating segments as of the fourth quarter of  the annual testing date  ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company provides various defined benefit pension plans for its us employees and sponsors three defined benefit healthcare and life insurance plans 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used by the company were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the moody s aa bond index and  to a lesser extent  the citigroup index  which represents a yield curve  ii the salary growth is based on the company s historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectations of future returns 
the rates used to determine the company s costs and obligations under its pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a basis point increase in the salary growth rate used would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when the company is made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
historically over the past three years  the company s allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in the company s current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase its allowance reserve by approximately million

the company makes no commitment to update any forward looking statement or to disclose any facts  events  or circumstances after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statements 
additional information about certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those items described in item a to this form k  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk currently  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company monitors foreign exchange and interest rate risks and manages such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
the company has various borrowing facilities where the interest rates  although not fixed  are relatively low 
currently  an increase in the associated interest rates would not significantly impact interest expense on these facilities  as the company currently has no debt 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and short term nature of the company s investment portfolio and the relative insignificance of interest income to consolidated pre tax income 
the company s financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which the company does business 
the company s primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing the company to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another  however  no such material hedges were outstanding at year end 
the company can initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively
