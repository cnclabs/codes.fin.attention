overview the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the sunday closest to april the years ended april  and may  each included weeks 
the company s operations are classified into two business segments mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics 
the mattress fabrics segment manufactures and sells fabrics to bedding manufacturers 
the upholstery fabrics segment manufacturers and sells fabrics primarily to residential and commercial contract furniture manufacturers 
the company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges or credits  goodwill impairment  and certain unallocated corporate expenses 
unallocated corporate expenses represent primarily compensation and benefits for certain executive officers and all costs related to being a public company 
segment assets include assets used in the operation of each segment and consist of accounts receivable  inventories  and property  plant and equipment 
the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million  compared with million for fiscal the company reported a net loss of million  or per share diluted  compared with a net loss of million  or per share diluted in fiscal restructuring and related charges of million were included in the net loss for fiscal in addition  restructuring and related charges of million and goodwill impairment of million were included in the net loss for fiscal the overall sales decline reflects lower sales in both operating segments 
the sales decline in the upholstery fabrics segment was attributable to continued soft demand industry wide for us produced fabrics  driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported fabrics  including an increasing amount of cut and sewn kits 
this sales decline in domestically produced upholstery fabrics was partially offset by the growth in sales from non us produced upholstery fabrics from the company s china operations 
sales of non us produced fabrics were million  up from million fiscal in the mattress ticking segment  the sales decline was due to overall softness in industry sales of mattresses in the first half of fiscal  and a decline in demand for printed ticking  which has become a less popular category 
also impacting mattress fabrics sales in fiscal was industry wide shortage of polyurethane foam used by mattress manufacturers related to disruptions from hurricane activity on the gulf coast in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to the restructuring and related charges that lowered operating income in fiscal  the company s financial performance was further impacted by higher raw material costs  the underutilization of the company s us manufacturing capacity and manufacturing variances related to restructuring actions in the upholstery fabrics segment  and duty customs assessments and manufacturing variances related to the start up of a capital project in the first and second quarters of fiscal in the mattress ticking segment 
in fiscal  the company implemented two major restructuring initiatives in the upholstery fabrics segment  both of which were designed to bring us manufacturing capacity in line with demand  reduce costs  increase asset utilization and improve profitability 
in addition  in an effort to offset the loss in sales of u 
s 
produced upholstery fabric products  the company expanded its sourcing and marketing of upholstery fabric produced internationally  primarily from china 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet demand from consumers for certain types of fabrics  as well as serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding production in international areas 
as a result of the company s offshore efforts  including its china platform  the company is experiencing higher sales of upholstery fabrics products produced outside the company s u 
s 
manufacturing plants  a trend that is expected to continue

segment analysis mattress fabrics segment net sales for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported net sales of million compared with million for fiscal mattress fabrics sales represented approximately of total sales for fiscal  down from in fiscal mattress ticking yards sold during fiscal were million compared with million yards sold in fiscal  a decrease of 
this trend reflects the overall softness in industry sales for mattresses  a decline in demand for printed ticking  which has become a less popular category  and the industry wide shortage of polyurethane foam used by mattress manufacturers related to disruptions from the hurricane activity in the gulf coast in the second quarter of fiscal the average selling price for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the lower pricing trend reflects the ongoing shift mattress manufacturers are making to less expensive common border ticking  which is the fabric that goes on the side of mattresses and box springs 
while prices in all product lines have continued to trend lower  the product mix began to change throughout fiscal with a higher percentage of sales of knitted ticking  which has a higher average selling price 
the company expects knitted ticking to account for an increasingly higher percentage of ticking sales as demand for this category is expected to increase 
operating income for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported operating income of million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal during fiscal  operating income was affected by duty assessments from us customs totaling  higher raw material prices that were not offset by customer surcharges price increases  and manufacturing variances related to the start up of the million capital project in the first and second quarters of fiscal starting in fiscal  the company took aggressive steps to address the strategic challenges facing its business in this segment 
the company reduced operating costs by consolidating its mattress ticking operations 
the million capital project involved relocating ticking looms from a higher cost upholstery fabric plant to existing ticking facilities in the u 
s 
and canada and the purchase of new weaving machines that are faster and more efficient than the equipment they replaced 
this transition was completed in the second quarter of fiscal second  to partially offset higher material costs  the company implemented a price increase of approximately three percent in this segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal also  the company placed more design emphasis on new products with higher margins 
as a result of these actions  operating income increased from in the first quarter  to in the second quarter  to in the third quarter  and to in the fourth quarter of fiscal segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment 
as of april   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal also as of april   property  plant and equipment totaled million  compared to million at the end of fiscal included in property  plant and equipment are assets located in the u 
s 
totaling million and million at april  and may   respectively

average selling price was per yard for fiscal compared with per yard in fiscal the lower sales reflect continued soft demand industry wide for us produced fabrics  driven by consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and other imported fabrics  including an increasing amount of cut and sewn kits 
however  in fiscal  the company continued to source and market upholstery fabrics produced internationally  primarily in china 
these measures are part of the company s continuing efforts to meet consumer preferences for certain types of fabrics  as well as to serve the growing segment of the company s customer base that is establishing or expanding furniture production in international areas 
as a result of the company s production and offshore sourcing efforts  including its china platform  the company is experiencing higher sales of upholstery fabric products produced outside of the company s u 
s 
manufacturing plants 
for fiscal  these sales increased from fiscal and accounted for million  or of upholstery fabric sales  in fiscal sales of fabric produced offshore of million accounted for of upholstery fabric sales for fiscal the growth in offshore produced fabrics is a trend that is expected to continue 
a major component of the company s offshore business is its china operation  which began manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal this initiative involves a strategy to link the company s existing customer relationships  design expertise and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturing in china  while continuing to maintain high quality standards 
the company is currently leasing three facilities in the shanghai region of china  where fabrics sourced in china are inspected and tested to assure compliance with the company s quality standards before shipment to its customers 
in many cases  additional value added finishing steps are applied to the fabrics in china before shipment 
the company s offshore business represents a significant growth opportunity in an increasing global furniture and fabrics market place 
the company s u 
s 
customers have continued to move an increasing amount of their fabric purchases  including cut and sewn kits  to china  and the company is in position to meet their fabric needs 
operating loss operating loss for fiscal was  or of sales  compared with an operating loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal these results reflect continued growth in sales and profits of non us produced fabrics  lower us manufacturing fixed costs and variances  and lower selling  general  and administrative expenses 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has revamped its us upholstery fabric product strategy by offering a more select group of attractively priced  high volume decorative and velvet fabrics that are well packaged by color and coordination  utilizing an increasing amount of lower cost imported yarns 
over this time period  the company has significantly reduced stock keeping units  or skus  of lower volume products that do not fit the company s us operating model  including the discontinuation of the us produced printed upholstery fabrics 
as a result  the company has reduced its product complexity going forward 
along with this shift in product strategy  the company has taken aggressive steps since the beginning of fiscal to reduce its us manufacturing costs and capacity and employment levels 
the company consolidated two velvet manufacturing operations and consolidated its finished goods distribution and design centers 
also  the company closed two of its three yarn manufacturing plants and outsourced these yarns to current suppliers 
in addition  the company completed the outsourcing for its decorative fabrics finishing operation and closed this plant at the end of the fiscal year 
the company has also combined its sales  design  and customer service activities for two divisions that were formerly operated separately within the upholstry fabrics segment  resulting in a more unified approach to service its customers 
as a result of these activities  the company has reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses for the upholstery fabrics segment by for fiscal non us produced sales sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside the company s us manufacturing operations  including fabrics produced at our china facility  were up in fiscal compared to fiscal and accounted for approximately of upholstery fabric sales for fiscal management believes that the development of its china platform represents a significant growth opportunity for the company 
as the company s us customers have continued to move an increasing amount of their fabric purchases to asia  the company has moved with them and responded with an operation designed to meet their needs 
a key component of this platform is the fabric finishing and inspection facility located near shanghai 
a key element of the the company s strategy is to control the value added finishing and inspection process  thereby assuring customers that the company s fabrics will meet or exceed us quality standards 
us produced sales as previously discussed  management has continued to take very aggressive actions over the past year to bring us manufacturing costs and capacity in line with current and expected demand trends 
as a result of these activities  the company now has three us manufacturing facilities operating in the upholstery fabrics segment one for velvet fabrics  one for decorative fabrics  and one for specialty yarns 
as of april   the book value of the company s us based upholstery fabrics fixed assets is million  compared with approximately million at the end of fiscal as of april   the company had assets held for sale with a carrying value of million 
these assets held for sale are expected to be sold in fiscal for this amount 
total us employment in the company s upholstery fabric operations was at the end of fiscal compared with at the end of fiscal this reconfiguration reflects the company s goal to be a more market driven company with fewer fixed assets and also substantially reduces our risk level going forward 
while management believes it is important to produce some level of upholstery fabric in the us to support its customers domestic fabric requirements  management remains committed to take additional steps if necessary to address the profitability of the company s us upholstery fabric operations 
the company could experience additional write downs of its property  plant  and equipment in this business if further restructuring actions become necessary

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s supplier for acrylic fiber  solutia  exited the acrylic fiber business 
in response to this event  the company identified certain international suppliers as alternative sources for procuring acrylic fiber

critical accounting policies u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and from bedding manufacturers approximately million 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
long lived assets 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an impairment accounting model for long lived assets to be held and used  disposed of by sale  or disposed of by abandonment or other means 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in fiscal  the company prepared an impairment evaluation on its upholstery fabrics segment due to continued adverse business results requiring further restructuring 
the company s assessment indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of the segment was sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets to be held and used 
the determination of future operating cash flows involves considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions  future sales and profitability  and future asset utilization 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions  or a decision to dispose of substantial portions of these assets  could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
sfas no

as of april   the company s remaining million of goodwill relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
in october  due to lower than expected operating profits and cash flow for the second quarter and year to date for fiscal in the upholstery fabrics segment  management determined that the remaining goodwill associated with this segment should be tested for impairment 
an independent business valuation specialist was engaged to assist the company in the valuation 
as a result of this valuation  the company recorded in its second quarter of fiscal a goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes  or per share diluted 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results

in making the judgment about the realization of the deferred tax assets  management has considered both negative and positive evidence  and concluded that sufficient positive evidence exists to overcome the cumulative losses experienced in recent years 
specifically  management considered the following  among other factors nature of the company s products  history of positive earnings in the mattress fabrics segment  capital projects that have been completed to further enhance the company s globally competitive cost structure in the mattress fabrics segment  recent significant restructuring actions in the domestic upholstery fabrics business to adjust the domestic cost structure and bring u

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement and real estate term loan 
as of april   there were million in borrowings outstanding under the real estate term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the real estate term loan  the company entered into a  notional principal interest rate swap agreement  which represents of the principal amount on the real estate term loan  and effectively converts the floating rate libor based payments to fixed payments at plus the spread calculated under the real estate term loan agreement 
the company s unsecured senior term notes have a fixed interest rate of and the canadian government loans are non interest bearing 
additionally  approximately of the company s long term debt is at a fixed rate or is non interest bearing 
thus  any foreseeable change in the interest rates would not expect to have a material effect on the company 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are due primarily to foreign subsidiaries domiciled in canada and china 
these subsidiaries use the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with their foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of canadian denominated and chinese denominated net sales and manufacturing costs are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore a change in the exchange rate at april  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
