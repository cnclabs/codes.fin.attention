item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financial federal corporation is an independent financial services company operating in the united states through three wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries  partnerships or joint ventures 
we also do not have any off balance sheet assets or liabilities other than commitments to extend credit  goodwill  other intangible assets or pension obligations  and we are not involved in income tax shelters 
we have one fully consolidated special purpose entity we established for our on balance sheet asset securitization facility 
we have one line of business 
we lend money in the form of installment sale agreements  secured loans and leases collectively referred to as finance receivables to small and medium sized businesses for their equipment financing needs 
we earn revenue solely from interest and other fees and amounts earned on our finance receivables 
we need to borrow most of the money we lend  therefore liquidity money immediately available for us to borrow is important 
we borrow from banks and insurance companies and issue commercial paper to money market funds and other investors 
approximately of our finance receivables were funded with debt at july  we earn interest income on our finance receivables and incur interest expense on our debt 
we focus on i maximizing the difference between the rates we earn on our receivables and the rates we incur on our debt net interest spread ii maintaining the credit quality of our receivables and iii managing our interest rate risk 
at july   interest rates on our finance receivables were fixed and floating  and interest rates on our debt were fixed and floating 
therefore  changes in market interest rates affect our profitability significantly 
the credit quality of our finance receivables can also affect our profitability significantly 
credit quality can affect finance income  provisions for credit losses and operating expenses through reclassifying receivables to or from non accrual status  incurring write downs and incurring costs associated with non performing assets 
we use various strategies to manage our interest rate risk and credit risk 
our main areas of focus are asset quality  liquidity and interest rate risk 
we discuss each in detail in separate sections of this discussion 
these areas are integral to our long term profitability 
our key operating statistics are net charge offs  loss ratio  non performing assets  delinquencies  receivables growth  leverage  available liquidity  net interest margin and net interest spread  and expense and efficiency ratios 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in note to the consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies and methods we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies involving significant judgment  assumptions and estimates are considered critical accounting policies and are described below 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is our estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is difficult to determine and requires a significant degree of judgment 
the allowance is based on total finance receivables  net charge off experience  non accrual and delinquent finance receivables and our current assessment of the risks inherent in our finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of counterparties includes customers  equipment vendors  manufacturers and customers owners or affiliates  collateral values and other factors 
we may need to change the allowance level significantly if unexpected changes in these conditions or factors occur 
increases in the allowance would reduce net income through higher provisions for credit losses 
the allowance was million of finance receivables at july  including million specifically allocated to impaired receivables 
the allowance includes amounts specifically allocated to impaired receivables and an amount to provide for losses inherent in the remainder of finance receivables the general allowance 
we evaluate the fair value of an impaired receivable and compare it to the carrying amount 
the carrying amount is the amount the receivable is recorded for when we make our evaluation and may include a prior write down or specific allowance 
if our estimate of fair value is lower than the carrying amount  we record a write down or establish a specific allowance based on whether fair value is determined solely by the value of the primary collateral  how certain we are of our estimate of fair value and on the level and type of other factors and items  such as guarantees and secondary collateral  supporting our fair value estimate 
to estimate the general allowance each quarter  we first analyze historical write down activity to develop percentage loss ranges by risk profile 
risk profiles are assigned to receivables based on past due status and the customers industry 
we then adjust the calculated range of losses for expected recoveries and we may also adjust the range for differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors to arrive at the estimated allowance 
we record a provision for credit losses if the recorded allowance differs from our current estimate 
although our method is designed to calculate probable losses  because significant estimates are used  the adjusted calculated range of losses may differ from actual losses significantly 
non performing assets we record impaired finance receivables at their current estimated fair value if less than their carrying amount 
we record assets received to satisfy receivables at their current estimated fair value less selling costs if less than their carrying amount 
we estimate these values by evaluating the expected cash flows and market value and condition of the collateral or assets 
we evaluate market value by analyzing recent sales of similar equipment and used equipment publications  using our market knowledge and making inquiries of equipment vendors 
unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect conclusions on expected cash flows  market value or the condition of collateral or assets  or time needed to sell the equipment would require us to record a write down lowering net income 
impaired finance receivables and assets received to satisfy receivables repossessed equipment totaled million of finance receivables at july  residual values we record residual values on direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii our projection of the equipment s fair value at the end of the lease 
we may not fully realize recorded residual values because of unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect projections of future equipment values 
this would lower net income 
residual values totaled million of finance receivables at july  historically  we have realized the recorded residual value on disposition 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for stock options under sfas no 
r using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires us to estimate the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  the expected life of options and the expected dividend rate 
estimating volatility  expected life and dividend rate requires significant judgment and an analysis of historical data 
also  sfas no 
r requires us to estimate forfeitures of stock options and shares of restricted stock also based on an analysis of historical data 
if actual results differ from our estimates significantly  compensation expense for options and shares of restricted stock and our results of operations could be impacted materially 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal years ended july  in millions  except per share amounts change change finance income interest expense net finance income before provision for credit losses provision for credit losses salaries and other expenses provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share net income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from receivables growth of  the higher net yield on finance receivables and strong asset quality  partially offset by the effects of significantly higher short term market interest rates and higher salary expense 
finance income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in average finance receivables million to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal and the higher net yield on finance receivables 
higher market interest rates  an increase in non interest finance income includes late charges  prepayment premiums and other fees and lower non accrual receivables raised the net yield on finance receivables to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense incurred on debt used to fund finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher average short term market interest rates and the million increase in average debt 
increases in short term market interest rates  partially offset by the lower weighted average rate on our fixed rate term debt and lower credit spreads the difference between the interest rates on our debt and the underlying market interest rates raised our weighted average cost of funds to in fiscal from in fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin net finance income before provision for credit losses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the significant increase in short term market interest rates 
we did not record a provision for credit losses on finance receivables in fiscal because of low net charge offs  continued strong asset quality and receivables growth 
the provision was million in fiscal the provision for credit losses is the amount needed to change the allowance for credit losses to the estimated level of inherent losses in finance receivables 
we did not need to increase the allowance because of the low amount of net charge offs and continued strong asset quality  and and we did not need to reduce it because of the significant growth in receivables 
net charge offs write downs of finance receivables less recoveries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the loss ratio net charge offs expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net charge offs decreased because of significantly fewer non accrual receivables 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from increased salary expense and  to a lesser extent  general increases in other operating expenses from strong receivables growth  partially offset by cost savings from significantly fewer non performing assets 
salary expense increased because of higher salaries  an increase in the number of employees and because sfas no 
r required us to record million of compensation expense for stock options in fiscal the expense ratio salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the rate of receivables growth exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the efficiency ratio expense ratio expressed as a percentage of net interest margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in net finance income exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in income before income taxes  and to a lesser extent  the slight increase in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal our effective tax rate increased because tax benefits reductions of the provision for income taxes cannot be recorded on the million of expense for incentive stock options not exercised and not sold in fiscal this was partially offset by the million tax benefit we recorded from the change in texas tax law enacted in our fourth quarter of fiscal our fiscal effective tax rate would have been excluding the effects of these two items 
diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share were lower than the percentage increase in net income because the average price of our common stock was higher in fiscal and there were more shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal from stock option exercises and awards of restricted stock

finance income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in average finance receivables million to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  lower non accrual receivables 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the lower net yield of finance receivables 
continued low long term market interest rates  partially offset by increases in yields on floating rate receivables from increases in the prime rate  reduced the net yield on finance receivables to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher average short term market interest rates and the million increase in average debt 
increases in short term market interest rates  partially offset by the lower average rate on our fixed rate term debt and lower credit spreads raised our weighted average cost of debt to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense for fiscal included two nonrecurring items  a million gain recognized on interest rate locks and a million expense representing unamortized deferred debt issuance costs on debt prepaid during the year 
net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest margin decreased because our weighted average cost of debt was higher  the net yield on our finance receivables was lower and our leverage increased slightly 
the provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from significantly lower net charge offs and improved asset quality  partially offset by receivables growth 
net charge offs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the loss ratio decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net charge offs decreased because of higher recoveries  fewer non accrual receivables and improved equipment values 
salaries and other expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from cost savings generated by significantly fewer non performing assets  partially offset by higher costs associated with being a public company 
salary expense did not change significantly 
the expense ratio decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the decrease in expenses and increase in receivables 
the efficiency ratio improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the decrease in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in income before income taxes  partially offset by the slight decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share exceeded the percentage increase in net income because we repurchased million shares of common stock in april finance receivables and asset quality we discuss trends and characteristics of our finance receivables and our approach to managing credit risk in this section 
the key aspect is asset quality 
asset quality statistics measure our underwriting standards  skills and policies and procedures and can indicate the direction and levels of future net charge offs and non performing assets 
july  july  in millions change change finance receivables   allowance for credit losses non performing assets delinquent finance receivables net charge offs as a percentage of receivables allowance for credit losses non performing assets delinquent finance receivables net charge offs as of and for the year ended finance receivables grew million during fiscal to billion at july  from billion at july  finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and direct financing leases 
loans were billion of finance receivables and leases were million at july  finance receivables originated in fiscal and were billion and billion  respectively 
originations increased because of greater demand for domestic equipment financing 
finance receivables collected in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
collections increased because of higher average finance receivables 
our primary focus is the credit quality of our receivables 
we manage our credit risk by using disciplined and proven underwriting policies and procedures  by monitoring our receivables closely and by handling non performing accounts effectively 
our underwriting policies and procedures require a first lien on equipment financed 
we focus on financing equipment with an economic life longer than the term financed  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in more than one type of business  ease of access and transporting  and broad  established resale markets 
securing our receivables with equipment possessing these characteristics can mitigate potential net charge offs 
we may also obtain additional equipment or other collateral  third party guarantees  advance payments or hold back a portion of the amount financed 
we do not finance or lease aircraft or railcars  computer related equipment  telecommunications equipment or equipment located outside the united states  and we do not lend to consumers 
our underwriting policies limit our credit exposure with any single customer 
this limit was million at july  our ten largest customers accounted for million of total finance receivables at july  our allowance for credit losses was million at july  and million at july  the allowance level declined to of finance receivables at july  from at july  because of lower net charge offs  continued favorable asset quality and receivables growth 
we determine the allowance quarterly based on our analysis of historical losses and the past due status of receivables at the end of each quarter adjusted for expected recoveries and any differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors 
the allowance level may decline further if our asset quality statistics remain at favorable levels 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and the loss ratio decreased to from 
net charge offs are at these low levels because of the low amount of non performing assets and strong demand for and strong value of the equipment we finance 
the net investments in non accrual impaired finance receivables  repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables  total non performing assets and delinquent finance receivables transactions with more than a nominal portion of a contractual payment or more days past due follow in millions july  non accrual finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets delinquent finance receivables percentage of non accrual receivables not delinquent before specifically allocated allowance of million at july  and million at july  our asset quality statistics stayed at favorable levels during the year 
net charge offs  non accrual receivables  repossessed equipment and delinquencies were far below expected levels 
therefore  we do not expect further improvement in these measures and reasonable increases would not necessarily indicate the start of a negative trend 
non accrual receivables decreased because we removed the non accrual classification from several large receivables we no longer considered impaired 
we believe we will collect the full amount of principal and interest due on these receivables based on payment performance and collateral coverage 
although we expect our asset quality statistics to remain favorable  the high price of oil and higher market interest rates could affect our statistics adversely 
gasoline and interest are significant costs for most of our customers and higher than normal increases in these costs could reduce their operating cash flows and their ability to remit payments significantly 
increases in these costs can also affect the economy adversely 
in addition  several customers owe us over million 
if any of these receivables become delinquent  impaired or repossessed  our asset quality statistics could worsen even though the overall trend may remain positive 
our finance receivables reflect industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations result from customers having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   our industry concentrations were construction related  road transportation and waste services and our us regional geographic concentrations were southeast  southwest  northeast  west and central 
liquidity and capital resources we describe our need for raising capital debt and equity  our need for having a substantial amount of liquidity money immediately available for us to borrow  our approach to managing liquidity and our current funding sources in this section 
key indicators are leverage the number of times debt exceeds equity  available liquidity and credit ratings 
our leverage is low for a finance company  we have been successful in issuing debt  we have ample liquidity available and the maturities of our debt are staggered and cumulatively exceed the maturities of our finance receivables 
liquidity and access to capital are vital to our operations and growth 
we need continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables  to purchase portfolios of finance receivables and to repay debt 
to ensure we have enough liquidity  we project our financing needs based on estimated receivables growth and maturing debt  we monitor capital markets closely and we diversify our funding sources 
funding sources available to us include operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  committed unsecured revolving bank credit facilities  dealer placed and direct issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
we believe our liquidity sources are diversified  and we are not dependent on any funding source or provider 
our term debt is rated bbb by fitch ratings  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and commercial paper issued by our major operating subsidiary million at july  is rated f by fitch 
as a condition of our f credit rating  our commercial paper outstanding must be exceeded by the unused amount of our bank credit facilities 
fitch last affirmed its investment grade ratings on our debt in august and maintained its stable outlook 
our access to capital markets and our credit spreads are partly dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
we had million available to borrow immediately under our bank credit facilities after subtracting commercial paper outstanding at july  our asset securitization facility could be increased by million at july  and we believe we can issue more term debt 
we believe  but cannot assure  sufficient capital is available to sustain our future operations and growth 
our major operating subsidiary s debt agreements have restrictive covenants including limits on its indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
none of the agreements have a material adverse change clause 
total debt increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity increased by million to million at july  from million at july  leverage debt to equity ratio increased to at july  from at july   but remains low  allowing for substantial asset growth 
historically  our leverage has not exceeded  also considered low for a finance company 
debt comprised the following in millions july  july  amount percent amount percent term notes asset securitization financings convertible debentures borrowings under bank credit facilities commercial paper total principal   fair value adjustment of hedged debt total debt   term notes we issued million of fixed rate term notes in march the notes comprise million of five year  notes due at maturity in march and million of seven year  notes due at maturity in march we received million in march and in may we issued million of five year  fixed rate term notes in may we received million in may and million in august the notes are due at maturity in may and august interest is payable semi annually 
we used the proceeds from these note issuances to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities 
we also repaid million of fixed rate term notes at maturity in fiscal with a weighted average rate of 
asset securitization financings our asset securitization facility was increased by million to million in august we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities 
we established the facility in july the facility was renewed for the fifth time in april and expires in april subject to further renewal 
the facility limits borrowings to a minimum level of securitized receivables 
if borrowings exceed the minimum level  we must repay the excess or securitize more receivables 
we can securitize more receivables during the term of the facility 
on expiration and nonrenewal of the facility  we must repay borrowings outstanding or convert them into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid monthly and would be fully repaid by march based on the contractual payments of the million of securitized receivables at july the unsecured debt agreements of our major operating subsidiary allow of its finance receivables to be securitized million at july  
therefore  we could securitize an additional million of finance receivables at july  borrowings are limited to of securitized receivables and can be further limited based on the eligibility of securitized receivables 
convertible debentures the convertible debentures  issued in fiscal  were convertible into million shares as adjusted of common stock at the adjusted conversion price of per share resulting in an adjusted conversion rate of shares for each  of principal 
in fiscal  we irrevocably elected to pay the value of converted debentures  not exceeding the principal amount  in cash 
this eliminated the million convertible shares 
any value over principal will be paid with shares of common stock 
the debentures can only be converted when i in any fiscal quarter the closing price of our common stock is at least higher than the conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the prior fiscal quarter the market price condition ii the debentures are rated bb or lower by fitch three ratings levels lower than the initial rating iii we call the debentures for redemption or iv a specified corporate transaction occurs 
no event allowing for the debentures to be converted has occurred through july  the market price condition would have been met at july  if the price of our common stock closed above for the required period 
the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange was on july  the debentures have a year term  but we can redeem them at principal anytime starting in april and debenture holders can require us to repurchase them at principal on each five year anniversary of issuance or when a specified corporate transaction occurs 
the market value of the debentures was of their principal amount at july  as reported by www

bank credit facilities we had million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from nine banks a million increase from july  at july  comprising million of facilities with five year original terms and million of facilities with one year original terms 
these facilities range from million to million 
borrowings under these facilities can mature between and days 
borrowings outstanding at july  matured august  the multiyear facilities expire as follows million in fiscal and million in fiscal these committed facilities are a low cost source of funds and support our commercial paper program 
we can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only 
these facilities may be renewed upon expiration 
bank credit facility activity is summarized below in millions years ended july  amount of banks amount of banks total beginning of year new expired not renewed increases total end of year renewed at expiration commercial paper we issue commercial paper direct and through a million program with maturities between and days 
because our commercial paper outstanding must be exceeded by the unused amount of our committed revolving bank credit facilities  the combined amount of commercial paper and bank borrowings  million at july   was limited to million at july  information on the combined amounts of bank borrowings and commercial paper follows in millions years ended july  maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at end of year contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations and other information at july  are summarized below in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years term notes convertible debentures operating leases other long term liability reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total payments percentage other debt cumulative payments    cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables    the weighted average maturity of our term debt term notes and convertible debentures was years at july  and years at july  term notes and convertible debentures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and operating leases in note the other long term liability is deferred compensation owed to three executive officers and our former ceo s beneficiary 
other debt is due within one year and comprises asset securitization financings  bank borrowings and commercial paper 
as shown in the table  after one year  cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables exceed cumulative payments under contractual obligations 
stockholders equity we have a common stock and convertible debt repurchase program 
at july   million was available under the program 
we repurchased  shares of common stock for million in fiscal we paid million of cash dividends and we received million from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock awards in fiscal market interest rate risk and sensitivity we discuss how changes in market interest rates affect our profitability and how we manage interest rate risk in this section 
higher short term market interest rates increased interest expense in fiscal by approximately million and reduced our net interest spread the net yield of finance receivables less the weighted average cost of debt  an integral part of a finance company s profitability  by approximately basis points 
we explain the reasons below 
our net interest spread is sensitive to changes in short term and long term market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates  swap rates and the prime rate 
increases in short term rates reduce our net interest spread this occurred in fiscal and decreases in short term rates increase our net interest spread because floating rate debt includes short term debt exceeds our floating rate finance receivables significantly 
because of our debt is floating rate compared to floating rate finance receivables of only  interest rates on our debt change faster than the yield on our receivables 
our net interest spread is also affected when short term and long term rates do not similarly change 
long term rates normally exceed short term rates 
when the differences between long and short term rates narrow resulting in a flattening yield curve or when short term rates exceed long term rates an inverted yield curve  our net interest spread should decrease and when the yield curve widens our net interest spread should increase because the rates we charge our customers are partially determined by long term market interest rates and rates on our floating rate debt are largely determined by short term market interest rates 
potential mitigating factors are i the rates we charge are also determined by the prime rate and equipment financing demand and ii issuing long term fixed rate debt 
our net interest spread is calculated below years ended july  net yield of finance receivables weighted average cost of debt net interest spread from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  short term market interest rates rose basis points  the yield curve flattened and is currently inverted 
this trend may continue although the federal reserve board did not raise its federal funds target rate at its last two meetings in august and september signaling a pause or potential end to short term market interest rate increases 
this rate is a benchmark short term market interest rate 
rising short term market interest rates and a flat or inverted yield curve reduce our net interest spread because interest rates on our debt would increase faster and by a greater amount than the yield on our receivables 
the yield on our finance receivables also may not increase and could decrease 
our income is subject to the risk of rising short term interest rates and a flat or inverted yield curve at july  because floating rate debt exceeded floating rate receivables by million see the table below 
the terms and prepayment experience of our fixed rate receivables mitigate this risk 
finance receivables are collected monthly over short periods of two to five years and have been accelerated by prepayments 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are scheduled to be collected in one year and the weighted average remaining life of fixed rate finance receivables excluding prepayments is approximately twenty months 
we do not match the maturities of our debt to our finance receivables 
the fixed and floating rate amounts and percentages of our finance receivables and capital at july  follow in millions fixed rate floating rate amount percent amount percent total finance receivables   debt principal  stockholders equity total debt and equity   floating rate debt asset securitization financings  bank borrowings  floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes  commercial paper and floating rate term note reprices interest rate changes based on current short term market interest rates as follows at july  million within one month  million in two to three months and million in four to six months 
the repricing frequency of floating rate debt follows in millions balance repricing frequency asset securitization financings generally daily bank borrowings generally daily floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes semi annually day average commercial paper to days day average floating rate term note monthly we quantify interest rate risk by calculating the effect on net income of a hypothetical  immediate basis point rise in market interest rates 
this hypothetical change in rates would reduce annual net income by approximately million at july  based on scheduled repricings of floating rate debt  fixed rate debt maturing within a year and the expected effects on the yield of new receivables 
this amount increases to million excluding the expected effects on the yield of new receivables 
we believe this is acceptable considering the lower cost of floating rate debt 
actual future changes in market interest rates and the effect on net income may differ materially from this amount 
other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point increase in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
we monitor and manage our exposure to potential adverse changes in market interest rates by using certain derivative financial instruments and by changing the proportion of our fixed and floating rate debt 
we may use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on existing debt and debt expected to be issued 
we do not speculate with or trade derivatives 
in january  we entered into a million interest rate lock expiring in march we designated the rate lock as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated issuance of five year fixed rate term notes hedging the risk of adverse interest rate changes  on the interest payments of the notes  through the date the interest rate is set on the note issuance 
we terminated the lock early when the interest rate was set on the note issuance in february we realized a million gain and determined there was no hedge ineffectiveness 
the cash flow hedge gain was recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income net of deferred income tax of million and is being reclassified to net income by reducing interest expense and deferred income tax over the five year term of the notes issued 
the notional amount of floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes was million at july  the swaps effectively converted fixed rate term notes into floating rate term notes 
semiannually  we receive fixed amounts from the swap counterparty banks equal to the interest on the fixed rate hedged notes  and we pay amounts to the swap counterparty banks equal to the swaps floating rates multiplied by the swaps notional amounts 
the swaps floating rates are indexed to six month libor at july  
the swaps increased interest expense by million in fiscal and reduced interest expense by million in fiscal the weighted average pay rate of at july  exceeded the weighted average receive rate by basis points 
the weighted average remaining term of the swaps at july  is years 
information for each swap at july  follows fixed notional receive floating issued expires amount rate pay rate reprices april april october july april october july june october july june october july june october august april october april august january new accounting standards we started recording compensation expense for stock options on august  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  revised sfas no 
r and according to the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
using sfas no 
r s modified prospective method 
this method requires us to record compensation expense for options unvested on august  and for options subsequently granted or modified 
prior periods will not be restated 
before august   we applied accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for our stock options 
we did not record compensation expense for stock options under apb no 
sfas no 
r did not change how we determine or recognize expense for shares of restricted stock and stock units 
we record the fair value of options as compensation expense over the options vesting periods using straight line or graded vesting accelerated methods 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options when they are granted 
we use the graded vesting method the method used for sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation pro forma disclosure to recognize compensation expense for options unvested on august  and we use the straight line method to recognize compensation expense for options granted after july  the fair value of shares of restricted stock and stock units equals the market value of our common stock on the date of award and are recorded as compensation expense over the awards vesting periods using the straight line method for awards without a performance condition and the graded vesting method for awards with a performance condition 
sfas no 
r requires compensation expense to be recorded only for stock based awards expected to vest 
therefore  we must estimate how many awards will be forfeited and periodically review our estimates based on actual forfeitures and revise them cumulatively as necessary 
we capitalize defer expensing a portion of stock based compensation expense as required by sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases sfas no 

amounts capitalized are included in finance receivables and amortized as a reduction of finance income over the terms of finance receivables using the interest method 
we record tax benefits on compensation expense for shares of restricted stock  stock units and non qualified stock options  and for incentive stock options but only when employees exercise and subsequently sell the shares within one year 
in fiscal  salaries and other expenses include million of compensation expense for options recognized under sfas no 
r resulting in a million tax benefit  and compensation expense for options capitalized under sfas no 
was million 
compensation expense recorded for stock options reduced fiscal diluted and basic earnings per share by and  respectively 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb  fin no 
in july fin no 
requires companies to determine if any tax positions taken on their income tax returns lowering the amount of tax currently due would more likely than not be allowed by a taxing jurisdiction
