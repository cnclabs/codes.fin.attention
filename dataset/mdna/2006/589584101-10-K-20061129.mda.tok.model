operating segments meridian s reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics  and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa  and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  and boca raton  florida  the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad  and contract research and development and manufacturing services 
results of operations overview fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to  or per diluted share increased from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiency across all businesses 
net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  an increase of  or compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  meridian determined that the carrying value of a supply contract related to the life science operating segment had become impaired and recorded such impairment to general and administrative expenses in the amount of  the contract provides for the supply of biological materials to the united states department of defense 
changes in the department s critical reagents program lowered the amount of materials to be supplied under the contract in future periods

difficile products increased  reflecting the market expansion and gains in market share related to the launch of immunocard c 
difficile toxins a b 
sales of respiratory products increased  also contributed to the increase  driven by growth in international markets and favorable changes in insurance reimbursement policies 
meridian s respiratory products include diagnostic tests for influenza  respiratory syncytial virus rsv  and mycoplasma 
h 
pylori sales increased  contributed to the increase due to increased testing and positive results from focused marketing efforts on the managed care sector 
sales increases for parasitology products increased  fungal products increased  food borne products increased  rotavirus products increased  and microbiology products  also contributed to favorable variances to fiscal for the european diagnostics operating segment  the sales increase offsets currency translation losses in the amount of approximately  sales in local currency  the euro  increased 
the local currency increase was driven by market increases in sales of h 
pylori products 
increases in sales of c 
difficile products  including immunocard c 
difficile toxins a b  also contributed to the increase 
these increases reflect market recognition of the benefits of performing c 
difficile testing for both toxin a and toxin b and increased benefits of rapid testing to hospital environments 
for the life science operating segment  the sales increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of oem concepts for a full year in fiscal  compared to eight months in fiscal this was partially offset by shifts in buying patterns by one large diagnostic manufacturing customer and one large defense customer  as well as the timing and number of contract services arrangements 
sales of made to order bulk antigens and antibodies to one customer provided sales of approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
for all operating segments combined  international sales were  or of total sales  for fiscal  compared to  or of total sales  in fiscal combined domestic exports for the us diagnostics and life science operating segments were  for fiscal  compared to  
table of contents in fiscal the remaining international sales were generated by the european diagnostics operating segment 
gross profit gross profit increased for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margins were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase reflects higher margins commanded by new rapid tests  such as immunocard c 
difficile toxins a b and operating efficiencies 
meridian s overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points

research and development expenses increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  were in fiscal and fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment and  related to the life science operating segment 
the us diagnostics operating segment increase was primarily attributable to increased stock compensation expense 
for the life science operating segment  during fiscal  research and development scientists were performing contract work for third party customers  and thus  their related costs were classified in cost of sales 
during fiscal  their efforts and activities were primarily focused on internal research and development work  and therefore charged to research and development expense  rather than being classified in cost of sales or inventory 
the increase for the life science operating segment reflects the classification of such costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment and  related to the life science operating segment  partially offset by a decrease of  for the european diagnostics operating segment 
the increase for the us diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to sales administration fees to group purchasing organizations and incentive compensation associated with higher sales levels  as well as higher salaries and benefits costs 
the increase for the life science operating segment was primarily due to business development costs and a full year of costs for the oem concepts business  acquired during the second quarter

table of contents effective july   meridian early adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  in accounting for its stock option plans 
meridian would have otherwise been required to adopt sfas no 
r on october  meridian elected to early adopt sfas no 
r in order to achieve a lower cost associated with performance based stock options that were granted to certain employees in december than would have been recognized under its previous accounting method  the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
pursuant to apb no 
 stock compensation expense for the performance options would have been measured at meridian s stock price at september   which was higher than at the grant date 
the fair value of these stock options  determined under a black scholes model at the date of grant  was substantially lower 
for this reason  meridian believed that early adoption of sfas no 
r was in the best interests of shareholders 
the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal year was  the amount of stock based compensation expense that would have been reported in fiscal under a full year of apb no 
was  operating income operating income increased in fiscal  as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income and expense interest expense declined for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was attributable to the positive effects of the fiscal debenture exchange and redemption transactions and the fiscal debenture redemption and conversion transactions discussed under liquidity and capital resources herein 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to favorable book to return adjustments related to non us sales activities in fiscal book to return adjustments represent changes to prior estimates and generally are determined upon filing meridian s tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
these adjustments are recorded in the period in which amounts previously estimated become known 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis 
table of contents meridian s operating cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets and consideration of acquisition plans 
meridian has historically maintained line of credit availability to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings levels  partially offset by higher investments in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower acquisition payments in fiscal  in part offset by net purchases of short term auction rate securities with certain of the proceeds from the september common share offering 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the september common share offering and increased dividend payments 
dividend payments were  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  reflecting increased dividend rates and common shares outstanding relating to the common share offering  stock option exercises and bond conversions in fiscal and fiscal net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements  debt service  and dividends during fiscal capital resources during august  meridian completed the renewal of its credit facility with its commercial bank 
the amount of the credit facility is  and includes  of term debt and capital lease capacity and a  line of credit that expires in september as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit portion of this facility 
as of september   meridian had outstanding  principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due september   bearing interest at and convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of

table of contents common shares at a price of 
holders converted  principal amount of debentures into  common shares during fiscal and  principal amount of debentures into  common shares during fiscal the conversion and redemption transactions reduced annual interest expense by  the conversion and redemption transactions are expected to reduce annual interest expense by approximately  the viral antigens acquisition  completed in fiscal  provided for additional purchase consideration  contingent upon viral antigens earnings through september  the oem concepts acquisition  completed in fiscal  provides for additional purchase consideration up to a remaining amount of  contingent upon oem concepts future calendar year sales and gross profit through december  earnout consideration paid during fiscal was  the amount of earnout consideration payable as of september  was  for viral antigens and  for oem concepts 
earnout consideration is payable each year  following the period earned 
meridian s capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately  for fiscal  and may be funded with operating cash flows  availability under the  credit facility discussed above  or proceeds from the september common share offering 
capital expenditures relate to manufacturing and other equipment of a normal and recurring nature as well as capacity expansion for the maine facility 

table of contents known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  amounts in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest payments relating to long term debt operating leases purchase obligations viral antigens earnout oem concepts earnout total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in maine  florida  belgium  and france  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
oem concepts earnout obligation is contingent upon oem concepts future calendar year sales and gross profit through december  other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
during october  meridian entered into a license agreement with eiken chemical co  ltd  that provides rights to eiken s loop mediated isothermal amplification technology for infectious disease testing in the united 
table of contents states and other geographic markets 
the agreement calls for payments of up to  japanese yen approximately  based on the achievement of certain milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
payments made during product development are expected to occur over a five year period beginning in fiscal derivative financial instruments meridian accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and therefore  the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for the ineffective portion of the hedge  gains or losses are charged to earnings in the current period 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
market risk exposure meridian has market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
meridian is exposed to foreign currency risk related to its european distribution operations  including foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition meridian s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in 
table of contents handling meridian s products 
management estimates rebate accruals based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
life science operating segment revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services  or multiple deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  using the principles in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
inventories meridian s inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis  except for certain inventories in the viral antigens business for which cost is determined on a last in  first out basis 
meridian establishes reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and this would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
changes to inventory reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
for the viral antigens purchase business combination  meridian elected to use last in  first out accounting for inventories for financial reporting purposes 
under last in  first out accounting  the stepped up inventory value will be charged to earnings in periods in which inventory quantities decline below those on hand at the acquisition date 
to date  inventory quantities have remained above levels on hand at the acquisition date 
intangible assets meridian s intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
table of contents by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
during fiscal  meridian determined that the carrying value of a supply contract related to the life science operating segment had become impaired and recorded such impairment in the amount of  to general and administrative expenses 
the contract provides for the supply of biological materials to the united states department of defense 
changes in the department s critical reagents program lowered the amount of materials to be supplied under the contract in future periods 
there have been no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of other such assets may not be recoverable 
meridian s ability to recover its intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  impairment of intangible assets could take place 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  meridian s provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
meridian prepares estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of meridian s tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
meridian s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
table of contents income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in meridian s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid in applicable foreign jurisdictions 
from time to time  meridian s tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
meridian s tax provisions take into consideration the judgmental nature of certain tax positions through the establishment of reserves for differences between the probable tax determinations and the as filed tax positions of certain assets and liabilities 
to the extent that tax benefits result from the completion of these examinations or the passing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
meridian believes that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operation
