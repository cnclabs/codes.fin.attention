overview diamond is a premier global management consulting firm 
we help leading organizations worldwide to understand and leverage technology to realize value in their businesses 
our firm offers clients skills in strategy  technology  operations and program management to help companies reduce costs  increase flexibility  address changing regulations and markets  improve operations  and grow their businesses 
we combine innovative strategic thinking  deep industry expertise  and a thorough understanding of technology to deliver results for our clients 
we work collaboratively with our clients  utilizing small  multidisciplinary teams of consultants because we believe the most lasting and significant improvements occur when the client is integrally involved in the change 
in march  our board of directors approved a strategy to focus the company on its markets in north america  the uk and india 
by focusing on these markets  we expect to improve margins and free cash flow 
as part of the board approved strategy  we have committed to a plan to sell the portions of the international operations that include the offices and respective operations in barcelona  dubai  madrid  m nich  paris and s o paulo and as a result these are reported as discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended north america  the uk and india are considered continuing operations and reported as such in the financial statements and related notes 
all previously reported data from the statements of operations and comprehensive income loss has been reclassified to conform with this presentation to allow for meaningful comparison 
the consolidated balance sheet as of march  aggregates amounts associated with the discontinued operations as described above 
during the fiscal year ended march  we generated net revenue from continuing operations of million from clients 
at march   we employed consultants and operations employees in continuing operations 
our continuing operations include six offices in north america  
table of contents europe and asia  which include chicago  hartford  london  mumbai  new york city and washington  dc we opened our mumbai  india and new york city offices in march we opened our hartford office in may as part of the restructuring activities implemented in the second quarter of fiscal year  we closed two offices located in lisbon  portugal and d sseldorf  germany 
the offices reported as part of discontinued operations accounted for consultants and operations employees as of march  our revenue is driven by our ability to secure new client engagements  maintain existing client engagements and develop and implement solutions that add value to our clients 
our revenue is comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursable expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements  and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement agreement 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement agreement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may be contractually required to bill for those services at an earlier or later date than the date services are provided 
provisions are made based on our experience for estimated uncollectible amounts 
these provisions  net of write off s of accounts receivable  are reflected in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also set aside a portion of the revenue from each client engagement to cover the estimated costs that are likely to be incurred subsequent to targeted project completion 
we refer to this as project run on 
this portion of the project revenue is reflected in deferred revenue and is calculated based on our historical experience 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we generate revenue in many different countries throughout the world and our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies 
the most common currencies that we operate under within continuing operations are the us dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
however  revenue from continuing operations is primarily denominated in the us dollar and as such  our revenues and expenses from continuing operations are not significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel costs 
project personnel costs consist of payroll costs  stock based compensation expense related to our consulting staff  variable incentive compensation  and related benefits associated with our consulting staff 
other expenses included in project personnel costs are travel  subcontracting fees  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
we consider the relationship between net revenue and project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses to be an important measure of our operating performance 
net revenue less project personnel costs before reimbursable expenses gross margin is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge to our clients  project personnel compensation costs  and the level of non billable costs associated with securing new client engagements and developing new service offerings 
our practice headcount from continuing operations increased to at march   compared to at december  and at march  our gross margin increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the third quarter of fiscal year the increase is primarily due to the increase in net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross margin decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these decreases are primarily due to increased project personnel compensation costs associated with an increase in stock based compensation expense  the increase in headcount and relatively flat revenue 
our annualized net revenue per practice professional continuing operations was thousand for fiscal year  compared to thousand for fiscal year our other recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  management and administrative support  and stock based compensation 
table of contents expense earned by personnel working in these functional areas 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the renting of office space and other administrative support for project personnel 
management believes that income from operations  which is gross margin less other operating expenses  is an important measure of our operating performance 
income from continuing operations before taxes increased million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the third quarter of fiscal year primarily due to the increase in net revenue and the reversal of a portion of a restructuring accrual in the fourth quarter of fiscal year income from continuing operations before taxes decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased project personnel and management and administration stock based compensation expense and recruiting and training development expenditures associated with the increase in headcount 
income from continuing operations before taxes in fiscal year also decreased compared to fiscal year due to the restructuring charge in september we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments 
our utilization rate related to continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was which increased from in the third quarter of fiscal year and in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
our utilization rate for fiscal year decreased to compared to in fiscal year free cash flow from continuing operations was million for the fiscal year ended march   and included a net use of cash related to the restructure accrual of million 
management believes that the free cash flow metric  which is a non gaap measure  defined as net cash provided by operating activities million net of capital expenditures million  provides a consistent metric from which the performance of the business may be monitored 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act relating to our operations  results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections 
words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  believes  estimates and similar expressions are used to identify these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
forward looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these 
table of contents estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we earn revenues from a range of consulting services  including helping organizations worldwide to leverage technology to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
revenue is recognized over the term of the client engagement in direct proportion to the level of services performed by each member of the engagement team during the period relative to the estimated total level of effort required to perform the project 
therefore  the amount of revenue recognized in a period is for all intents and purposes  equal to the amount that would be recognized based on the stated contract price and the ratio of direct costs incurred in the period to perform the service to the total estimated direct costs of the project 
service revenue recognition inherently involves a degree of estimation 
examples of important estimates in this area include determining the level of effort required to execute the project  calculating costs incurred and assessing our progress toward project completion on an ongoing basis 
we believe that these are critical accounting estimates because they can materially affect our revenues and earnings and require us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor project performance and revenue recognition including monthly reviews of the progress of each project against plan  staff and resource usage  service quality and client feedback 
from time to time  as part of our normal management process  circumstances are identified that require us to revise our estimates of the timing of revenues to be realized on a project 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects revenue previously recognized  we record the full effect of the revision in the period when the underlying facts become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue we earn our revenues by providing consulting services to clients 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
the terms of our client engagements also require us to assume the risk of non collection of amounts billed to clients 
management makes estimates of the amount of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable that may not be collected from clients 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect our operating results and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
in making these estimates  management specifically analyzes individual client balances  the composition of the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and considers our overall experience with estimating uncollectible amounts 
we recognize the effect of changes in our estimates  assumptions and assessments of the factors impacting the collectibility of amounts due from customers on an ongoing basis 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance from continuing operations was million  including unbilled accounts receivable of million  and net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
unbilled receivables represent revenues and reimbursable expenses earned for services performed that have not been billed 
unbilled receivables are typically billed the following month 
although we and our clients agree on the scope of projects  expected deliverables and related fees in advance  from time to time we have made revisions to the scope of work and deliverables without 
table of contents making a corresponding adjustment to the fees for the project 
we refer to this as project run on as these revisions generally cause a project to extend beyond its targeted completion 
we monitor our actual project run on experience on an ongoing basis and perform monthly reviews of projects in progress against plan 
we provide for project run on costs based on our analysis of historical experience 
these provisions  net of actual costs incurred on completed projects  are reflected in deferred revenue 
as of march   our deferred revenue balance from continuing operations was million 
also included in the deferred revenue balance is million of prepaid client fees related to consulting services that the company expects to earn in future periods 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel costs 
project personnel costs consist of payroll costs  stock based compensation expense related to project personnel  variable incentive compensation  and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting fees  third party vendor payments and non billable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the amount of these other direct costs can vary substantially from period to period depending largely on revenue 
however  project personnel and related expenses are relatively stable in nature  and declines in revenue will often result in reduced utilization of professional personnel and lower operating margins 
our other recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  management and administrative support  and stock based compensation expense earned by personnel working in these functional areas 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  facilities including the renting of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
in september  december  june and september we recorded restructuring charges related to specific actions we took to better align our cost infrastructure with our near term revenue expectations 
for the september and december restructuring charges  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plans and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for the june and september restructuring charges  we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plan and accounted for this plan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the restructuring charges and accruals required certain significant estimates of costs related to severance and other personnel related expenses  as well as costs related to reductions in office space and estimated sublease income to be realized in the future  the write off of associated leasehold improvements  and the establishment of accruals for other contractual commitments which are not expected to provide future benefit 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances 
although we do not expect there to be significant changes to our plans  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term due to unanticipated events  resulting in adjustments to the amounts recorded  and the effect could be material 
such revisions will be reflected in the financial statements in the period they occur 
valuation of deferred tax assets in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered from future taxable 
table of contents income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a value we believe will be recoverable by future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the company s future income over the life of the deferred tax asset  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future income require significant judgment because actual income has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our project pipeline  and other appropriate factors 
we have deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their related amounts in the financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets 
management recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of march  largely due to the tax losses we incurred during fiscal years and based on the positive financial performance in the us in fiscal years and  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance as of march  as of march   the remaining continuing operations valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million and covered international deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards  and certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
the need to maintain a valuation allowance is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis

management and administrative support expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increases in the costs incurred for third party consulting services related to the sarbanes oxley compliance initiative  stock based compensation expense  and incentive compensation for management and administrative personnel  which were partially offset by a decrease in information technology related depreciation expense 
management and administrative support expenses include the rent expense associated with our five offices from continuing operations in north america  the uk and india

due to valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets  losses in the uk are not tax benefited which creates a significant difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory tax rate 
also  due to the company s intent to focus only on its core markets in north america  the uk and india  during fiscal year we recorded a million tax expense due to the reversal of certain foreign tax credits we no longer expect to utilize 
the income tax benefit of million recorded in fiscal year was principally related to the reversal of the valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets of million at year end

liquidity and capital resources the following table describes our liquidity and financial position on march  and march  in millions working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments unutilized bank credit facilities stockholders equity amounts reported as of march  include combined continuing and discontinued operations 
amounts reported as of march  include only continuing operations 

table of contents we repurchased million shares of treasury stock and million shares of treasury stock during fiscal year and for an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
over the past several years  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options by our employees 
these internal sources of liquidity have been adequate to support our operating and capital expenditure requirements as well as to provide the funding needed for our stock repurchase program 
we anticipate that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating and capital requirements at least through fiscal year the million of short term investments as of march  were investments in auction rate securities 
the company s investment in auction rate securities as of march  was zero 
the company has not invested in auction rate securities since the first quarter of fiscal year and does not have any plans to invest in auction rate securities in the foreseeable future 
as a matter of prudent business practice  we maintain a revolving line of credit pursuant to the terms of an unsecured credit agreement with a commercial bank under which we may borrow up to million at an annual interest rate based on the prime rate or based on libor plus basis points  at our discretion 
this line of credit is reduced  as necessary  to account for letters of credit outstanding that secure our office leases 
as of march   these letters of credit totaled million 
as of march   there were no outstanding borrowings and we had approximately million available under this line of credit 
this line of credit is set to expire on july  we do not rely on our line of credit for liquidity  as evidenced by the fact that we have never borrowed cash against the line of credit 
from time to time  the company undergoes various tax examinations and audits at its corporate and subsidiary locations 
as a result of an international tax inspection  on january  the company provided a bank guarantee in the amount of million euros with the international taxing authority in order to appeal the assessment 
the terms of the guarantee require that it be renewed annually until the results of the tax inspection are settled 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in the appeal  the maximum amount that we will be required to pay under the terms of the guarantee is million euros 
in addition  we currently hold shares of dtpi common stock in an escrow account for the benefit of recovering from a third party payments made by us under the guarantee 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for any potential exposure related to this assessment based upon the amounts recoverable under the escrow shares and our current accruals which were determined based on advice from our third party tax advisors

table of contents our billings from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended march  totaled million and million  respectively  compared to million and million for the three and twelve months ended march  the increase in billings is due to an increase in revenue and reimbursable expenses resulting from both revenue generating projects and increased consultants 
these amounts include value added tax vat which are not included in net revenue and billings to clients for reimbursable expenses 
our gross accounts receivable balance from continuing operations of million at march  represented days of billings for the quarter ended march  at march   the gross receivable balance from continuing operations was million which represented days of billings for the quarter ended march  the increase in accounts receivable at march  as compared to march  was principally due to the timing of client payments 
the increase in days of billings in accounts receivable from continuing operations was primarily due to the timing of client billings and payments 
an increase or decrease in accounts receivable and days of billings in accounts receivable between periods is primarily the result of the timing of the collection of payments and issuance of invoices  and therefore  it is not indicative of a trend in the business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk international revenues are generated primarily from our services in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the financial statements of our non us businesses are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary 
as a result  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results and profitability 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as well as in other short term debt instruments
