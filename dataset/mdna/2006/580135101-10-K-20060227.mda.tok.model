item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company primarily franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
in addition  the company operates certain non mcdonald s brands that are not material to the company s overall results 
of the more than  mcdonald s restaurants in over countries  over  are operated by the company  more than  are operated by franchisees licensees and over  are operated by affiliates 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and franchised restaurant sites 
this ensures long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for of the business  including the real estate interest  while the company generally has no capital invested 
while we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor  we continually review our restaurant ownership mix that is our mix between company operated  conventional franchise  joint venture or developmental license to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability  with a focus on underperforming markets and markets where direct restaurant operation by us is unattractive due to market size  business conditions or legal considerations 
although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants along with our franchisees  we can develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial 
in addition  we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 
our company operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations  the financial health of franchisees or other factors 
revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees primarily include rent  service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales  with specified minimum rent payments 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments united states  europe  asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea  latin america  and canada 
in addition  throughout this report we present a segment entitled other that includes non mcdonald s brands eg  boston market and chipotle mexican grill chipotle 
the us and europe segments each account for approximately of total revenues 
france  germany and the united kingdom  collectively  account for over of europe s revenues  australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for nearly of apmea s revenues  and brazil accounts for over of latin america s revenues 
these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately of total revenues 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth  systemwide sales growth  operating margins and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the company believes they better represent the underlying business trends 
comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all mcdonald s restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction  reimaging or remodeling  and natural disasters 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays  weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales 
the company refers to this impact as the calendar shift trading day adjustment 
this impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales 
typically  the annual impact is minimal  with the exception of leap years 
systemwide sales include sales at all mcdonald s and other restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates 
while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company  mcdonald s corporation management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because it is the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over a one year time period as well as longer time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by taking the constant foreign exchange rate change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator and dividing this by the constant foreign exchange rate adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator 
the calculation assumes an average exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the company s years of success has been driven by the strength of mcdonald s global brand and our unique business relationship among franchisees  suppliers and the company collectively referred to as the system 
this business model is key to our success  fostering our ability to be locally relevant  a competitor in the marketplace and a contributor to our communities 
this strategic alignment enables the system to pursue innovative ideas that satisfy our customers and profitably grow our business 
in  the company initiated a comprehensive revitalization plan focused on maximizing customer satisfaction and strengthening our financial position 
we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants and aligned the system around our customer focused plan to win 
a combination of customer centric initiatives designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing were implemented around five drivers of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
in  we substantially achieved our near term goals by executing our strategy 
we improved the taste of many of our core menu offerings and introduced a variety of menu choices that were well received by customers such as new salad lines  breakfast and chicken offerings 
we offered a variety of price points to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers 
we streamlined processes such as new product development and restaurant operations  improved our training programs  and implemented performance measures  including a restaurant review and measurement process  to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to serve customers better 
we also launched the i m lovin it marketing theme  which achieved high levels of customer awareness worldwide 
throughout  we remained aligned and focused on executing the plan to win  using our customer centric philosophy as our guide 
our performance reflected our continuously evolving customer relevance and powerful brand strength that culminated with december marking our nd consecutive month of positive global comparable sales 
in the us  our strong sales momentum continued as increased customer demand for our core and premium products  breakfast menu and more convenient hours fueled growth on top of strong prior year comparisons 
in europe  we focused on gaining traction and building momentum across the entire segment 
we had success in france and russia and we gained traction in germany where customers responded favorably to our ein mal eins one by one value platform and premium products like salads plus 
the uk remained a challenging marketplace and our efforts to gain traction in this market will take time 
we are encouraged by our progress in europe and confident that our focus on enhancing customers experience through menu  marketing and value initiatives will generate improvements over time 
over the past three years  in line with our commitment to revitalize the brand  we have exercised greater financial discipline 
we delivered against the targets laid out in our revitalization plan and achieved many significant milestones 
today  our resulting financial strength and substantial cash generating ability is a testament to system alignment and focus on growing our existing restaurant business 
our progress has created the opportunity to return even greater amounts of cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases after funding investments in our business that offer solid returns 
in  we increased the dividend to 
per share  a increase from the dividend and we repurchased over billion of common stock since the beginning of to enhance shareholder value 
highlights from the year included comparable sales increased building on a increase in systemwide sales increased 
excluding the positive impact of currency translation  systemwide sales increased 
consolidated revenues increased to a record high of over billion 
excluding the positive impact of currency translation  revenues increased 
net income per common share was compared with in cash from operations increased million to billion 
capital expenditures were about billion 
the annual dividend was increased per share  to or million 
share repurchases totaled about billion 
one year roiic was and three year roiic was for the decrease in impairment and other charges credits included in operating income benefited these returns percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
see other matters for details of the calculation 
mcdonald s corporation on january   the company early adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this new accounting standard requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively 
in connection with the adoption  the company adjusted the mix of employee long term incentive based compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing certain cash based compensation primarily annual incentive based compensation and other equity based awards 
share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption 
in  share based and related compensation expense was per share 
the pro forma share based compensation for and was per share and per share  respectively 
during  the company repatriated approximately billion of foreign historical earnings under the homeland investment act hia 
a majority of the repatriation was funded through local borrowings in certain markets  which totaled billion 
this resulted in an increase in cash and debt on our consolidated balance sheet at year end  which is expected to be temporary and does not signal any change in our financial and capital discipline 
the repatriated cash will primarily be used to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiative  new restaurant openings and salaries in the us apart from hia related activity  the company paid down over billion of debt during outlook for the company s long term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience one that builds brand loyalty and delivers long term  profitable growth for all shareholders and the system 
our long term goals remain unchanged average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens 
these goals exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
our guiding customer centric framework  the plan to win  remains solidly in place 
we plan to create more relevant and deeper connections with our customers by capturing significant opportunities within the five fundamental drivers of our plan people  products  place  price and promotion 
the initiatives around each p continuously evolve to maximize customer relevance and system profitability 
we are confident that our plan  supported by our unique system of franchisees and suppliers and our collective alignment will continue to drive long term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value 
in  we remain committed to offering quality products that satisfy our customers demands for choice and variety  promoting the importance of physical activity and providing nutritional information on our food packaging 
we will continue to introduce locally relevant new products that complement our core menu and provide customers with more reasons to visit  more often 
in the us  we will extend the variety of our salad and chicken lines with the introduction of an asian chicken salad  and we expect to strengthen our share of the growing chicken sandwich market with our premium spicy chicken sandwich 
in europe  we are continuing our focus on our everyday value menus  such as ein mal eins and pound saver along with premium offerings including salads and sandwiches such as the big tasty 
in asia  where rice is a daily staple  we successfully introduced an innovative rice burger in in taiwan kalubi beef or spicy chicken served on a lightly toasted rice patty and have plans to extend this concept to other asian markets in delivering value through a variety of menu price points that appeal to our broad range of customers has long been part of our history 
a strong balance of core menu favorites  premium products and everyday value ensures that we can appeal to most people 
in europe and elsewhere  we continue to combine everyday value with a strong trade up strategy to remain relevant to today s customer and drive profitability 
we also plan to capitalize on opportunities to improve the customer experience in our restaurants through improved service and ambiance 
we continue to implement people training programs to enhance the overall service experience and we will extend our restaurant operation improvement process roip measurement of restaurant execution to even more markets this year 
our remodeling efforts will continue around the globe 
in   restaurants worldwide are expected to be remodeled  utilizing innovative  modern designs 
we will continue to enhance customer convenience by extending operating hours  accepting debit  credit and gift cards  enabling wireless internet access and adding double drive thru lanes in select restaurants 
we believe providing information on nutrition and promoting physical activity support our customers needs to make the best choices for their lifestyles 
starting in  we will provide nutrition information on the majority of our food packaging using an easy to understand icon and bar chart format 
we plan to implement the new packaging in more than  restaurants by the end of the year 
we are the first quick service restaurant to do this  guided by customer input and independent experts from around the world 
in connection with executing the plan to win  to improve local relevance  profitability and returns  we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to identify potential operational and growth opportunities 
the ownership mix in a given market depends on our plans for the market  local operating conditions  restaurant level results in the market and legal and regulatory constraints 
in the united states  france  germany and australia  for example  we believe that our current ownership mix is appropriate in light of current operating results 
by contrast  we plan to re franchise at least company operated restaurants in the uk in and mcdonald s corporation we expect that the percentage of company operated restaurants in that market will continue to decline from its current 
in canada  we plan to review our company operated restaurants and determine the most appropriate ownership mix and organize personnel around a revised structure for the business 
in countries where franchising is not yet a well established business model  such as china or russia  we will continue to own and operate our restaurants 
we have also recently identified between and markets where we will pursue converting our existing ownership to a developmental licensee structure over the next three years 
under this structure  which the company successfully employs in countries outside the us approximately restaurants  the licensees own the business  including the real estate interest  and use their local knowledge and their capital to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term 
included in these countries were two additional markets restaurants that became developmental licensees in and work on this change of ownership began a couple of years ago 
while the company generally has no capital invested in this type of market  it does receive a royalty based on a percent of sales 
the royalty rate varies by market and is based on growth and profitability opportunity within the market 
our plans to change our ownership mix through conventional re franchising and increased use of developmental licenses will affect our results 
the results of company operated restaurants are recorded in our consolidated financial statements  and we are responsible for their ongoing capital investments  whereas restaurants operated under franchise or license agreements generate revenue streams without a comparable level of capital investment by us 
we do not expect that the financial impact of our plans to adjust our ownership mix will be material in given the time required to execute these plans 
our plans to convert markets to a developmental license structure depend on our ability to identify prospective licensees with the experience and financial resources to be effective operators of mcdonald s restaurants 
we are in the process of identifying potential licensees in some of these markets  but we cannot predict how quickly we will complete transactions 
the markets that we have targeted as candidates for developmental licenses had in the aggregate about  restaurants predominately company operated and in had billion in sales  million in capital expenditures  million in selling  general administrative expenses and generated a modest operating loss 
at december   the company s net investment in these markets was about billion 
as a result of our annual testing  we recorded impairment charges for some of these markets in the last three years 
for others  current cash flows or undiscounted projected cash flows are such that no impairment charges were required 
in each case  our impairment testing was based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure 
we will continue our annual impairment testing for these assets based on this assumption until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within months  and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds 
we may not recover our entire net investment in each of these markets and may therefore record losses in future periods as we adjust our ownership mix 
the timing and amount of any losses will depend on the circumstances of each transaction 
currently  we do not believe that any significant transactions are likely to be completed within months 
while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share  the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results 
changes in constant currency systemwide sales are driven by changes in comparable sales and restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add about percentage point to sales growth in in constant currencies 
most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in the company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in us comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about cents 
similarly  an increase of percentage point in europe s comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about cents 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to increase at a rate less than systemwide sales  in constant currencies  and to decline as a percent of revenues  compared with without considering any impact of changes in ownership mix 
a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro and the british pound 
if the euro and the british pound both move in the same direction compared with  the company s annual earnings per share would change about cents to cents 
based on current rates  foreign currency translation is expected to negatively affect earnings in the first quarter the company plans to return to pre hia debt and cash levels as we pay down debt over the next couple of years 
the late borrowings  used to fund dividend payments to repatriate earnings back to the us parent company  resulted in a temporary increase in both cash and debt on our year end consolidated balance sheet 
however  our net debt position gross debt outstanding less cash available for investment has improved significantly  excluding this one time opportunity 
the company expects interest expense in to increase to compared with  based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect this increase will be partly offset by the related higher interest income from cash available for investing  resulting in a to increase in interest expense  net of interest income 
mcdonald s corporation the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to  although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
in and combined  the company expects to return between billion and billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends 
the company expects to complete share repurchases of about billion in the first quarter of in january  chipotle completed an initial public offering of million shares resulting in proceeds of approximately million to chipotle 
mcdonald s sold million chipotle shares resulting in proceeds to the company of million  while still remaining the majority shareholder 
as a result of the offering  the company will record a pretax nonoperating gain of about million in the first quarter of during the first quarter  the company has taken certain actions to improve profitability in two challenging markets 
in brazil  we reached an agreement to acquire restaurants operated by several litigating franchisees and expect to incur pretax charges of approximately million 
in the uk  as part of a strategic review of its high street locations  the company has developed a plan that focuses on improving profits of those sites 
in connection with that plan  we expect to close restaurants in the uk in the first quarter  resulting in lease cancellation and other charges of approximately million pretax

mcdonald s corporation supplemental information regarding company operated mcdonald s restaurants as noted earlier  we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance  profits and returns 
although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  we can develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that we introduce systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial 
in addition  we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor 
like other restaurant companies  we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs  and we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and  to a lesser extent  write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe that the following supplemental information regarding our company operated restaurants in our most mature and significant markets will assist investors in understanding the performance of this business as if it were operated as franchised restaurants 
while this analysis would shift certain revenues and costs between company operated and franchised margins  consolidated operating margins would not change 
in our company operated margins  our occupancy expense outside rent expense and depreciation for buildings leasehold improvements would be replaced by rents and service fees comparable to those paid by franchisees 
since selling  general administrative expenses are not specifically allocated to the company operated restaurant business  an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the us  canada and our three major markets in europe 
we believe  on average  a range of  to  per restaurant is typical  but will vary depending on local circumstances and the structure of the market 
these costs reflect the support services we believe are necessary to provide the best customer experience 
other selling  general administrative costs to support the brand would be covered by a service fee charged to this business 
us europe canada dollars in millions number of company operated restaurants at year end sales by company operated restaurants company operated margin outside rent expense depreciation buildings leasehold improvements average franchise rent service fees as a percent of sales represents rent on leased sites 
the percentage of sites owned versus leased varies by country 
europe has many countries with varying economic profiles and a wide range of franchise rent service fees as a percent of sales 
mcdonald s corporation selling  general administrative expenses consolidated selling  general administrative expenses increased in and in and in constant currencies 
the share based and related incremental compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
r accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in the constant currency increase in reflected higher performance based incentive compensation 
selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were in compared with in and in  and selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were in compared with in and in the share based and related incremental compensation expense increased these ratios percentage points and percentage points  respectively  in management believes that analyzing selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales  as well as revenues  is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

in  the company recorded million of net pretax charges consisting of million primarily related to impairment in latin america  million for about restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in latin america  and a million favorable adjustment to the charge for restaurant closings  primarily due to about fewer closings than originally anticipated 
restructuring in  the company recorded million of pretax income  primarily due to favorable adjustments related to the conversion of a market to a developmental licensee in apmea and certain liabilities established in and due to lower than originally anticipated employee related and lease termination costs 
in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million related to the loss on the sale of donatos pizzeria  the closing of all donatos and boston market restaurants outside the us and the exit of a domestic joint venture with fazoli s  and million related to revitalization plan actions of mcdonald s japan 
lease accounting correction during  like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries  the company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions 
following this review and in consultation with its external auditors  the company corrected an error in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property 
the result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed rent escalations by revising the computation of straight line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods 
as the correction related solely to accounting treatment  it did not affect mcdonald s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases 
its effect on the company s earning per share  cash from operations and shareholders equity was immaterial 
these adjustments primarily impacted the us  china  boston market and chipotle 
other markets were less significantly impacted  as many of the leases outside of the us do not contain fixed rent escalations

cash from operations totaled billion and exceeded capital expenditures by billion in  while cash from operations totaled billion and exceeded capital expenditures by billion in cash provided by operations increased million in and million in due to strong operating results  primarily in the us  and changes in working capital 
the changes in working capital in benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year

capital expenditures increased million or in and million or in the increase in capital expenditures in was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants  primarily in the us the increase in capital expenditures in was also due to increased investment in existing restaurants  primarily in the us and europe  partly offset by lower expenditures on restaurant openings 
capital expenditures in both years reflects the company s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants  including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world 
capital expenditures invested in major markets  excluding japan  represented about of the total in  and japan is accounted for under the equity method  and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts 
capital expenditures in millions new restaurants existing restaurants other properties total total assets primarily corporate related equipment and furnishings for office buildings 
new restaurant investments in both and were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and or opportunities for long term growth 
average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market 
these costs  which include land  buildings and equipment  are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants  construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs 
although the company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened  in total development costs consisting of land  buildings and equipment for new traditional mcdonald s restaurants averaged approximately million in the us and approximately million in the markets where development was concentrated outside the us for  the us  china and eight other consolidated markets are expected to account for about of restaurant openings

cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis

operating income  which excludes interest income  is used to compute return on average assets  while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
returns on assets and equity return on average assets return on average common equity return on average assets was negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the company s planning related to hia and subsequent repatriation of earnings in cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by percentage points  percentage points and percentage points in  and  respectively

hia related borrowings caused an percentage point decrease in fixed rate debt in hia related borrowings caused an percentage point increase in foreign currency denominated debt in moody s  standard poor s and fitch currently rate the company s commercial paper p  a and f  respectively  and its long term debt a  a and a  respectively 
historically  the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt 
total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above  which includes debt outstanding on the company s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases 
based on their most recent calculations  these agencies add between billion and billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes 
the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant leases outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating mcdonald s corporation on leased sites 
based on this calculation  for credit analysis purposes approximately billion to billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 
certain of the company s debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries 
there are no provisions in the company s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company s business 
the company has billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements as well as approximately billion under a us shelf registration and million under a euro medium term notes program for future debt issuance 
the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and primarily in miscellaneous other assets million and million  respectively and other long term liabilities million and million  respectively 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 
regarding derivatives 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
in  the company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to hia 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity 
total foreign currency denominated debt  including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion for the years ended and  respectively 
in addition  where practical  the company s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements 
certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below  or aggregate exposures exceed  certain contractual limits 
at december  and  the company was required to post collateral of million and million  respectively 
the company s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of us dollars euro canadian dollars british pounds sterling australian dollars brazilian reais the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both company operated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations 
in addition  the company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements 
cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
mcdonald s corporation contractual cash outflows contractual cash inflows in millions operating leases debt obligations minimum rent under franchise arrangements thereafter total the maturities reflect reclassifications of short term obligations to long term obligations of billion  as they are supported by a long term line of credit agreement expiring in debt obligations do not include million of sfas no 
noncash fair value adjustments 
this effect is excluded as these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity 
the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service limitations 
the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the company s qualified profit sharing and savings plan 
total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million at december  and million at december  and were included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to long term obligations  the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling million at december  other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and or complexity 
property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options  restricted stock and rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
mcdonald s corporation losses on assets held for sale are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets  the assets are available for sale and probable of occurring within months and the net sales proceeds from the assets are expected to be less than its net book value 
litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
during  the company recorded a million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company s us tax returns 
during  the company recorded a million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the company s tax returns 
the company s us tax returns are under audit 
the audit is expected to be completed in late or early and no estimate can be made of the benefit or charge  if any  resulting from the completion of the audit 
deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures 
the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in the businesses 
if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management to determine the effectiveness of capital deployed 
roiic is calculated as a percentage and is calculated on a one year basis and a three year basis 
the numerator is the company s constant foreign exchange rate excludes the impact of foreign currency translation incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization  based on a comparison of the current and base periods 
the denominator is the constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less net cash collections and issuances of notes receivable  which do not generate operating income 
constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis detailed in the tables below 
these weightings reflect the relative contribution of each quarter s investing activities to constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income 
once the weightings are applied to the adjusted cash used for investing activities in each quarter  the results are aggregated to arrive at the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 
mcdonald s corporation the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year roiic are as follows one year roiic calculation years ended december  incremental change numerator pro forma operating income depreciation and amortization currency translation constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization denominator weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities currency translation constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities one year roiic reflects adjustments for comparability purposes with respect to share based expense as described in discussion of operating income
