background quovadx offers software and services for application and system development  extension  integration and analysis to enterprise customers worldwide 
quovadx is comprised of three divisions the integration solutions 
table of contents division isd  which offers private and public healthcare organizations interoperability solutions for clinical and financial integration  the carescience division carescience  which provides care management and analytical solutions to hospitals and health systems  and the rogue wave software division rogue wave  which provides reusable software components and services to professional developers for enterprise class application development in many different market segments  primarily in the financial services  telecommunication and software industries 
the company acquired carescience  inc in september of and rogue wave software  inc in december of as a result of these acquisitions  the company has been organized into the three operating segments  with a centralized headquarters staff 
executive summary the following table represents total revenue amounts in thousands and percentages by division year ended december  revenue percentage division isd carescience acquired in september rogue wave acquired in december total the following table represents total net income loss from continuing operations by division before allocations of corporate selling  general and administrative  and other income and expenses included in the other operations line amounts in thousands income loss from continuing operations division isd carescience acquired in september roguewave acquired in december other operations total overall  net loss from continuing operations of million decreased from the net loss from continuing operations of million in significant improvements were reported by each of the three operating divisions as depicted above 
these improvements in net income  or lower net losses  combined with other cost containment initiatives in other operations at the corporate level resulted in a significantly overall lower loss from continuing operations in compared to  despite only minor improvements  and in some cases declines  in overall revenue 
the improvement in net loss in is primarily attributable to improved gross margins  cost containment efforts including reduction of personnel in certain areas  discontinuing funding for non strategic products and service offerings  the sale of underperforming or non strategic assets in and million related to insurance reimbursements received for previously incurred legal expenses associated with the class action lawsuits 
these cost reductions  combined with the elimination of products that had lower  or in some cases negative gross margins  helped contribute to an improvement in overall gross margins from in to in the gross margin for included an asset impairment charge which contributed  or million  to cost of revenue 
cost containment efforts in included the consolidation of facilities resulting in lower rent expenses and the restructuring of divisional research and development departments and sales and marketing departments that resulted in lower personnel costs 
additionally  legal and audit fees decreased in compared to as a result of decreased attestation fees  third party fees associated with sarbanes oxley project costs  the internal investigation into activity from the restatement efforts  and million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for legal expenses associated with defending and responding to class action lawsuits 
overall these cost 
table of contents containment efforts resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately million or of revenue 
these efforts  combined with the improvement in overall gross margins  were the primary reasons that cash provided by operations increased to million in  compared to cash used in operations of million in in  the company also significantly improved its ending cash  cash equivalents restricted cash  and investments balance  which increased to million at december   up from million at december  integration solutions division isd provides solutions primarily to hospitals and healthcare systems that emphasize interoperability to optimize business processes  improve system performance and achieve strategic business goals 
some of these goals may include streamlining and automating processes  improving cash flow and eligibility verification  decreasing manual intervention costs  improving access and security to critical data  while adhering to hipaa standards  increasing ability to share data through regional health information organizations rhios  increasing revenues  and integrating a enterprise wide master patient index 
isd generates its revenue from software license sales  product support and maintenance known as recurring revenue and professional services 
professional services revenue is typically derived from implementation of our licensed product offerings  consulting services and education and training provided to our customers 
recurring services revenue is normally derived from post contract support and maintenance on previously installed software licenses  transaction services related to certain products that support customer processing of payment and insurance verification products  upgrades  error correction and telephone support 
within recurring revenue  we also have a large outsourcing contract with a major customer that accounted for of total company revenue in this contract is scheduled to terminate in november while overall revenue in isd has declined in by million  the division reported operating income of million compared to operating losses of million in and million in this is primarily a function of higher software license sales that traditionally result in higher gross margins and lower costs of revenue  higher margins in services achieved by exiting from unprofitable or low margin fixed price legacy contracts which accounted for approximately million of services revenue in that was not realized in  cost reductions in facilities  sales  research and development to align support organizations within the division to strategic assets  and reduction in amortization and asset impairment expenses of million resulting from capitalized software write offs in that were not included in license revenue has increased from due to additional market penetration  particularly via expanded international sales channels and additional sales domestically achieved through channel partner arrangements and third party software sales 
for the year ended december  international license revenue represented of total isd software license revenue  up from in services revenue represented of isd revenue for the year ended december   down from in the decline in services revenue in isd is primarily attributable to a million reduction in revenue associated with the closure of fixed price legacy contracts that were either not profitable or were allowed to expire based on a decision by management that they were no longer a strategic focus of the company 
we have historically realized lower gross margins in our service business than our license business due to increased personnel costs to deliver and support the product offerings 

table of contents recurring services revenue includes maintenance revenue  outsourcing services  transaction processing and other services 
maintenance revenue is derived from agreements for providing unspecified software updates  error corrections  and telephone support 
revenue from maintenance agreements is included in recurring services revenue and represents of isd revenue for the year ending december  outsourcing revenue is generated primarily by one large contract that is scheduled to expire in november revenue from this contract represents approximately of isd revenue for the year ended december  carescience division the carescience division provides care management services and analytical solutions to hospitals and health systems  to access and analyze information about patient care practices  physician and facility performance  care processes  resources and outcomes 
in addition  carescience has provided services and a product implementation for community wide clinical data exchange to support rhios 
the division s future ability to increase revenue will depend upon  among other factors  its ability to develop and maintain strategic alliances in the healthcare industry and to position its products accordingly 
these advocacy efforts are a critical part of the division s ongoing activities 
the carescience division has historically generated revenue from the software license sales  product support and maintenance and services under an application service provider asp model 
revenue is normally recognized ratably over the term of the contracted period 
carescience subscription agreements typically cover an initial three year to five year period with provisions for automatic renewals 
revenue for carescience increased by or million in compared to the increase is attributable to additional contract executions in  as well as additional professional services revenue related to specific incremental projects 
losses from operations in carescience decreased from million to  in  primarily as a result of higher revenue but also due to an improvement in gross margins from in to in professional services revenue represented of total revenue for the year ended december  and is derived from consulting services associated with implementation of our product offerings  project specific deliverables or education and training 
recurring services revenue is primarily outsourcing services 
outsourcing revenue is derived from three major customer contracts 
recurring services revenue represents of revenue for the year ending december  rogue wave software division rogue wave provides reusable software components and integrated software tools that facilitate application development  supporting professional developers using the c programming language 
in addition  the division provides a service oriented architecture soa development framework  allowing existing c applications to communicate and interoperate with other types of software in the enterprise 
rogue wave generates its revenue from the software license sales  product support  maintenance and professional services 
software license revenue represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  we believe that license revenue for the sourcepro product is likely to decline over time 
this is based on the assumption that the primary products  the sourcepro and stingray tools  which target the c programming language  will eventually diminish in usage compared to other current application development programming languages such as java 
we do have plans to launch new products to combat the decline in the legacy business 
rogue wave hydra  a standards based distributed business process engine and development framework based on soa principles enabling an order of magnitude performance improvement in customer s new or existing enterprise applications  expect to help offset anticipated declines and enable growth in the rogue wave software division  is one such product 
additionally  rogue wave continues to expand sales of its legacy products in international markets 
for the year ended december   international license revenue represented of rogue wave s total software license revenue 
recurring services revenue includes maintenance and support revenue 
maintenance revenue is derived from agreements for providing unspecified software updates  error corrections  and telephone support 
revenue from maintenance agreements is included in recurring services revenue and represented of total division revenue for the year ending december  
table of contents professional services revenue represented less than of the division s total revenue for the year ended december   and contributed significantly lower gross margins than our software license business 
professional services revenue represents software development  implementation  consulting services and training 
service revenue is likely to increase as a percentage of total revenue in based on service revenue generated from the launch of the new product rogue wave hydra 
background on financial statement restatement  class action lawsuits and sec investigation into accounting practices sec proceedings 
in december  we were notified by the us securities and exchange commission sec that it was conducting an informal inquiry into selected transactions completed in the third quarter of in march  we voluntarily notified the sec that we would restate our financial results for the unaudited third quarter of  after this notification  the sec informed us that its informal inquiry would be expanded to include our relationship with infotech network group and would become a formal investigation 
in april  we received notice from the sec of a formal order of investigation and subpoena 
the sec has since expanded the investigation to include other customer relationships 
this investigation is ongoing 
legal proceedings 
following our march restatement announcement  various shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against the company  certain former officers and  in the case of certain lawsuits  against our independent directors 
for a further description of the nature and status of these legal proceedings  see part i  item legal proceedings 
enhanced financial disclosure controls 
our ongoing internal review includes an evaluation of our policies and procedures for disclosure and internal controls  corporate governance and other processes  in order to ensure the quality  consistency and timeliness of our financial information and reporting 
we continue to invest resources in upgrading our financial reporting processes and capabilities  including hiring additional personnel  utilizing outside consultants and implementing new review processes 
we plan to continue investing significant resources on this initiative and in connection with the reporting on internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of restatement of financial statements for and on march   the company announced that it was restating its third quarter financial results to reverse all previously recorded revenue associated with infotech 
the company believed at the time of the shipments that collection of the receivable was probable due to the establishment of a credit line by infotech that could be used for payment 
after the shipments of software product  the company encountered unanticipated delays in obtaining payment from infotech 
based on further analysis of infotech s ability to pay for the software purchased  the accounting for the revenue recognized was revised from an accrual to a cash basis 
as a result  we materially restated our previously announced financial results for the third and fourth quarters of by the deletion of all revenue and commissions that had been recorded related to infotech 
as a result of this restatement  the company s audit committee retained independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the infotech relationship 
additionally  the company  in conjunction with new management and under direction of its board of directors  undertook a review of all historical accounting policies and practices 
as a result of this subsequent review  additional accounting inaccuracies were identified affecting the company s financial results for the years ended december  and accordingly the company restated its historical financial results for the years ending december  and critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company relied on significant estimates in preparing the financial statements  allocating the purchase price of its acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debt  the percentage of completion of fixed priced 
table of contents professional service contracts  the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recoverability of capitalized software costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our license agreements generally provide either that customers pay a perpetual license fee based on a specified number of instances of the software or the type of software modules licensed or pay a subscription fee for a set number of years 
customers that purchase licenses  under a perpetual license agreement  generally enter into renewable one year maintenance agreements that entitle the customer to receive unspecified updates on the licensed software  error corrections and telephone support  generally for a fixed fee 
the methodology the company uses to recognize perpetual license software license and related services revenue is dependent on whether the company has established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the separate elements of a multiple element agreement 
if an agreement includes license  service and maintenance elements  and we have established vsoe of fair value on the undelivered service and maintenance elements  the revenue for the agreement will be recognized based on the residual method 
under the residual method the vsoe of fair value is assigned to the service and maintenance elements and the remaining agreement fee is allocated to the license element 
the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software if the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  the collection of the fees is probable  the fees are fixed and determinable  and an agreement is signed 
revenue based on the vsoe of fair value from the service and maintenance elements of the agreement that are to be delivered at a future date is initially deferred 
revenue from the services element is recognized as the services are provided 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally twelve months 
when the related services elements are essential to the functionality of the base product  or when the company has not established vsoe of fair value for the remaining services  the software license fees are deferred and the entire contract is recognized ratably over the period that the last element is delivered 
utilizing the criteria provided in sop  we evaluate the vendor specific objective evidence to determine the fair value of the elements delivered in situations where multiple element arrangements exist 
professional services revenue represents software development  implementation  consulting services  education and training 
when revenue is recognized from a fixed price contract and collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
when revenue is recognized from a time and materials contract  and the collection of fees is probable  the company recognizes professional services revenue as the services are provided 
when revenue from professional services contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  management estimates the costs to complete the services to be provided under the contract 
there are risks and uncertainties associated with the percentage of completion estimation process 
the company may encounter budget and schedule overruns caused by external factors beyond its control such as the utilization and efficiency of our consultants and the complexity of our customers it environment 
adjustments to cost estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the current estimates of the costs to complete the services exceed the revenue to be recognized under the contract 
maintenance revenue is derived from agreements for providing unspecified software updates  error corrections and telephone support 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally twelve months 
other recurring services revenue includes outsourcing services  subscription services  transaction processing and other services 
when the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is 
table of contents recognized over the service period 
when the fees are charged on a per transaction basis and collection of the fees is probable  revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed 
when collection of fees is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
the company does not require collateral from its customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reserve for the inability of certain customers to pay their accounts receivable balances 
the company periodically assesses the financial condition of its customers to determine if there is reasonable assurance of collectibility 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of those customers deteriorates 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to determine the realization of our receivables  including assessing the likelihood of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
the company reversed previously recorded bad debt expense of  for the year ended december  and recorded bad debt expense of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assessed the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and other reserves require a high degree of judgment from management 
we use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired businesses 
other intangible assets include  developed technology  customer related assets such as order backlog  and trade name 
the company recorded million of goodwill resulting from its rogue wave and carescience acquisitions 
at december   we had intangible assets of million  net of amortization 
software development costs software development costs are required to be expensed until the point that technological feasibility of the product is established  which the company has determined to be when a detailed program design is complete 
once technological feasibility is established  the company capitalizes internal and external labor costs incurred in developing the software  until the product has reached general availability 
the establishment of technological feasibility and continuing evaluation of the recoverability of the capitalized software development costs requires management s judgment with respect to the impact of external factors such as future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated life  which is generally three years 
at december   the company had million of capitalized and acquired software development costs  net of amortization 
the company capitalized software development costs of million and million  respectively for the years ended december  and in  the company retired fully amortized capital software assets totaling million 
asset impairments financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires that goodwill at each reporting unit be tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
we use an independent third party of evaluate goodwill 
factors that are considered in the review for impairment include significant under performance  major changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
the company has identified the fourth quarter as the period for its annual impairment test 
the company performed its annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of  and no impairment was indicated 
future cash flow estimates are a significant component of our goodwill impairment analysis 
projected cash flows are based on historical results and on our forecast of future performance of each operating segment 
the assumptions used in our analysis  are based on our best estimates  and include market growth rates  future pricing  
table of contents market acceptance of new products and services and necessary future capital investments 
if actual results differ from our expectations  such as if market acceptance of rogue wave hydra is less than anticipated or if the costs to develop future rogue wave products is higher than expected  our estimate of future cash flows would be reduced 
if future cash flow estimates were reduced by more than for our rogue wave reporting unit  we could be required to record goodwill impairment losses in our results of operations 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of other long lived assets  including  but not limited to  property and equipment  software  and intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses 
we also utilize judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses  including the applicable discount rate 
accounting for contingencies the company is involved in several lawsuits 
the company uses the criteria in fsaf no 
accounting for contingencies to determine whether to accrue an amount for the possible outcome of pending litigation 
the factors we consider are the period in which the underlying cause of the pending litigation occurred  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
an accrual for a loss contingency is recorded if it is possible to estimate the amount of loss the company could incur and it is probable that the company will incur the loss 
share based compensation at december   the company had three stock option plans and one employee stock purchase plan 
beginning in  as part of the iso incentive stock options stock option plan  the company granted restricted stock awards to board members and executives 
the company has elected to account for stock based compensation arrangements through using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  stock compensation is recognized to the extent that the exercise price is less than the market price for the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the stock compensation expense recognized in  totaled million  and is primarily related to the restricted stock awards granted for the first time in and to members of the company s board of directors and executives 
the remainder of stock compensation expense and all of the expense is related to the conversion of rogue wave stock options when exchanged at acquisition for the quovadx stock options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
share based payment  sfas no 
r  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair value 
pro forma disclosure and the intrinsic value method of accounting will no longer be alternative methods of disclosure 
we plan to adopt this standard when required  currently january  we have decided to use the modified prospective method of adopting sfas no 
r and the black scholes merton valuation model 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate the impact of adopting sfas no 
r to be additional compensation expense in of approximately million  which includes the unvested portion of current outstanding stock options and estimated stock option grants 
significant estimates are required under sfas no 
r to calculate the fair value of share based compensation 
on september   the company s compensation committee approved  effective october   the acceleration of vesting for out of the money unvested stock options held by current employees  including 
table of contents executive officers 
stock options held by non employee directors were not included in such acceleration 
these actions were taken in accordance with the applicable provisions of the company s stock option plans 
in taking these actions  the compensation committee imposed restrictions on the stock option awards granted to principal officers and executive officers of the company  which restricts the ability of each such principal and or executive officer to sell any shares underlying any such stock option award as long as they are employed by the company 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these underwater stock options was made primarily to avoid recognizing compensation expense in future financial statements upon the adoption sfas no 
r  which is effective january   and requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized on the company s financial statements based on their fair values 
the aggregate estimated compensation expense associated with these accelerated options that would have been recognized in the company s income statements after adoption of sfas no 
r by the company  had the acceleration not occurred  totaled million 
deferred taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
temporary differences arise when revenues and expenses for financial reporting are recognized for tax purposes in a different period 
the company has recognized  before the valuation allowance  a net deferred tax asset 
the majority of the deferred tax asset is net operating loss nol carryforwards and unused tax credits 
the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be utilized 
as a result of this analysis  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
the company will continue to evaluate the need to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and will make adjustments in accordance with the accounting standard
