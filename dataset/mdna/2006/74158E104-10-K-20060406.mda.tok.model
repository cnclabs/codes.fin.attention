item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s subsidiaries are defined in note of the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million in the prior year 
the change reflects the increase in oil and gas prices throughout the entire year  combined with changes in our working capital accounts 
we expect sufficient cash flow to be provided by operations during because of higher projected production from new properties  combined with oil and gas prices consistent with and steady operating  general and administrative  interest and financing costs 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of financial instruments 
currently we have no such arrangements in place 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in we project that we will spend million in the gulf of mexico and million on onshore wells 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was million 
the company expects to expend a similar amount in effective march  we agreed with our lenders to increase the company s borrowing base to  as of march    was borrowed under the facility 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and 
table of contents gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial covenants defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
it is the goal of the company to increase its oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the company also continues to explore and consider opportunities to further expand its oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of the company s capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on the company s assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
repurchase of limited partners interests the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of the calculation of amounts offered for partnership interests acquired pursuant to our repurchase commitment 
revisions in such estimates may alter the amount of our future annual commitments 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  repurchase offer amounts would increase or decrease respectively
