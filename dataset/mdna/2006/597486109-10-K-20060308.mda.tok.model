introduction prior to the annual report  the company discussed its operations through three reportable segments manufactured housing insurance  all other insurance products and services and transportation 
however  as the company has continued to grow its non manufactured housing insurance products  management s analysis of its insurance business has evolved in order to facilitate a more focused examination of its varying insurance products 
as a result  the company has divided its insurance products into four distinct groups residential property  recreational casualty  financial institutions  and all other insurance products 
the discussions of results of operations and liquidity  capital resources and changes in financial condition address these four reportable insurance segments and our transportation business 
a summary description of the operations of each of these segments is included below 
our residential property segment includes primarily manufactured housing and site built dwelling insurance products 
approximately of american modern s property and casualty and credit life gross written premium relates to physical damage insurance and related coverages on manufactured homes  generally written for a term of months with many coverages similar to homeowner s insurance policies 
our recreational casualty segment includes specialty insurance products such as motorcycle  watercraft  recreational vehicle  collector car and snowmobile 
our financial institutions segment includes specialty insurance products such as mortgage fire  collateral protection and debt cancellation  which are sold to financial service institutions or their customers 
the all other insurance segment includes products such as credit life  long haul truck physical damage  commercial  excess and surplus lines and also includes the results of our fee producing subsidiaries 

table of contents our specialty insurance operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  american modern insurance group  inc american modern which controls eight property and casualty insurance companies  two credit life insurance companies  three licensed insurance agencies and three service companies 
american modern is licensed  through its subsidiaries  to write insurance premiums in all states and the district of columbia 
m g transport services  inc and mgt services  inc 
collectively m g transport operates a fleet of dry cargo barges for the movement of dry bulk commodities such as petroleum coke  ores  barite  sugar and other dry cargoes primarily on the lower mississippi river and its tributaries and manages river transportation equipment owned by others on a fee based arrangement 
overview of recent trends motorcycle the combined ratio for the motorcycle product improved to in compared to in this was due primarily to rate increases and other corrective underwriting actions 
rate increases averaging and were approved by various states insurance departments in and  respectively 
these rate increases resulted in an increase in motorcycle s net earned premium in and a increase in net earned premium during in addition  we have added expertise to our staff and have refined our product offering to better match the needs of our target market 
as we expected  due to the underwriting and rate actions  gross written premium decreased to million in compared to million in we believe that the motorcycle product is now positioned to be profitable in the years ahead and enhances our total product package offered to agents 
we are not anticipating an overall rate increase in this line during and we intend to implement strategies that will translate to moderate levels of growth in and higher levels of growth in the years thereafter 
property and casualty profitability for the year  american modern s property and casualty combined ratio losses and expenses as a percent of earned premium improved to compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the combined ratio is due to the significant decreases in losses related to the motorcycle and excess and surplus lines products 
manufactured housing  our largest product offering  continued to deliver strong underwriting results despite the higher than normal level of catastrophe losses due to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
american modern s manufactured housing combined ratio for was compared to in excluding catastrophe losses  the manufactured housing combined ratio improved to in compared to in exposure management during  american modern s disciplined exposure management was an essential part of our risk management strategy 
we continued to take the necessary underwriting actions  particularly in our watercraft line  to balance our coastal exposures 
in addition  over the last years  we have reduced our property exposures in specific coastal states by approximately while  at the same time  manufactured housing shipments to these states constituted over half of the national shipments 
we have also benefited by broadening our product platform to include products that do not carry the same level of catastrophic risk  such as motorcycle 
we believe these strategies leave us well positioned for profitable future growth 

table of contents american modern s catastrophe reinsurance program is another significant aspect of our exposure management 
our reinsurance structure is similar to the program with a million increase in retention  from million to million  and the purchase of an additional million of protection on top of our previous million cover 
due to the volatile weather patterns of  we will absorb a significant increase in our base reinsurance cost in which will nearly double the base cost of this increase  along with the additional cover  will adversely impact our earnings per share by approximately cents 
we have already begun efforts to recoup these costs through appropriate rate increases and or product changes 
however  this is a process that takes some time  including additional time after state approvals to get the new rates and product changes into place within the renewal book and earned premium 
these efforts will likely produce minimal benefit to our bottom line  and likely will not be fully realized until property and casualty premiums american modern s total property and casualty gross written premiums decreased to million in compared to million in manufactured housing premiums decreased to million in compared to million in gross written premiums were pressured by the continued decline associated with several large manufactured housing lender accounts that are no longer making new manufactured housing loans 
the top line was also adversely impacted by deliberate exposure management actions undertaken during the year 
in order to reverse this trend  american modern has continued to add to its sales force and has devoted significant energy to raising its brand and market awareness 
we also continue to invest in our modernlink technology in order to differentiate american modern from its competitors 
we believe these actions will allow us to grow our top line gross written premiums over the long term 
commercial liability run off in september  american modern exited the manufactured housing park and dealer commercial liability business 
we have no outstanding unearned premium related to this business 
during  we experienced higher than expected losses related to this line 
due to the adverse development  american modern strengthened reserves in the latter part of to address the future run off claims 
in and  american modern has experienced favorable development in the claims settled for the year and believes that the loss exposure is adequately reserved for the remainder of the run off period

december  change recreational casualty direct and assumed written premiums net written premiums net earned premium service fees total revenues income before taxes gross written premiums for our recreational casualty products decreased due primarily to the planned decrease in motorcycle premiums as american modern took the necessary corrective underwriting actions and rate increases to position the motorcycle product for profitability 
in addition  we have added expertise to our staff and have refined our product offering to better match the needs of our target market 
as a result of these actions  the combined ratio for the motorcycle product improved to in compared to in as american modern has now properly positioned the motorcycle product  we intend to implement strategies to profitably increase premiums for the product in the upcoming years 
financial institutions the following chart is an overview of the results of operations of the company s financial institutions insurance segment in s 
december  change financial institutions direct and assumed written premiums net written premiums net earned premium total revenues income before taxes 
table of contents the decrease in gross written premiums for our financial institutions insurance products was driven by the collateral protection and mortgage fire products which decreased million and million  respectively  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in collateral protection gross written premiums in compared to was due to the assumption of a million book of business during the second quarter of which included a one time assumption of unearned premium totaling million 
the decrease in mortgage fire gross written premiums resulted primarily from the sale of a mortgage portfolio in which was serviced by one of our agents within this line 
profits increased for our financial institutions insurance products as this segment was impacted by a million loss related to the run off of a cancelled product line in no such run off losses were incurred in all other insurance the following chart is an overview of the results of operations of the company s other insurance segment in s 
december  change all other insurance direct and assumed written premiums net written premiums net earned premium agency revenues service fees total revenues income before taxes american modern s excess and surplus lines and credit life products were the primary drivers of the increase in gross written premiums in compared to a large percentage of the company s excess and surplus lines gross written premium is ceded to reinsurers 
in addition  a large percentage of credit life gross written premium is ceded to an insurance affiliate of the producing agent 
the improvement in profitability in compared to is due primarily to the improved underwriting results related to our excess and surplus lines business and our park and dealer business 
midland consolidated investment income and realized capital gains although net investment income is allocated to segments and product lines  the investment portfolio is generally managed as a whole and therefore is more meaningfully discussed in total 
net investment income increased to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in investment yield 
the annualized pre tax equivalent investment yield  on a cost basis  of the company s fixed income portfolio was in compared to in realized investment gains and losses are comprised of three items capital gains and losses from the sale of securities  derivatives features of certain convertible securities and other than temporary impairments

the company s investment portfolio does not currently include any other types of derivative investments 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses lae overall  american modern s losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased in to million from million in as mentioned in the segment discussions above  the decrease was due primarily to improved underwriting results for the motorcycle  excess and surplus lines  and park and dealer products combined with decreased earned premiums in compared to while the overall financial impact of catastrophes in was worse than  due to reinstatement premiums and other catastrophe related items  loss and loss adjustment expenses due to catastrophes actually decreased in to million compared to million in during and the company experienced favorable loss development  while it experienced unfavorable loss development in this was attributable to several factors 
the company exited a commercial liability product line in related to manufactured housing park operators and dealers 
original loss reserve estimates in and related to this line were not adequate 
loss reserve estimates were increased in to account for this deficiency 
subsequent settlement of these reserves has been for amounts below the revised loss reserves  resulting in a redundancy in and another factor that contributed to the favorable development was an overestimate of the reserves related to the motorcycle line of business  the excess and surplus lines business and the liability component of our other personal lines products 
the liability components associated with these lines are inherently less predictable than the company s traditional property coverages 
the company entered the motorcycle line in and the excess and surplus lines in the excess and surplus line has continued to grow at a rapid pace while the motorcycle line contracted in and insurance commissions and other policy acquisition costs american modern s commissions and other policy acquisition costs decreased in to million from million in this decrease is attributable to the decrease in net earned premium 
however  the decrease was partially offset by an increase in performance based commission expense as a result of the improved underwriting results achieved in compared to the fluctuations in performance based commission expense 
table of contents are attributable  in part  to american modern s pay for performance commission policy with agents representing the company which reduces the up front commission paid but rewards favorable underwriting and growth performance with a higher performance based commission 
operating and administrative expenses the company s operating and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in this increase is due primarily to expenses related to modernlink  our proprietary information systems and web enablement initiative  and an increase in employee salaries and benefits 
in addition  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r in which resulted in the recognition of million in stock option expense 
transportation m g transport  midland s transportation subsidiary  contributed million of income  before taxes  in compared to million in the increased profitability was due partially to significantly improved freight rates during  a trend that we expect to continue in in addition  m g transport focused its resources on shorter more profitable moves in this strategy considerably improved m g transport s profitability  but hampered its top line revenues

in  the run off of these discontinued lines increased pre tax income by million  or per share diluted 
midland consolidated investment income and realized capital gains although net investment income is allocated to segments and product lines  the investment portfolio is generally managed as a whole and therefore is more meaningfully discussed in total 
net investment income increased to million in from million in this increase is due primarily to the increase in the size of the portfolio 
the increase in portfolio size was due primarily to the investment of million in proceeds related to the public stock offering  the investment of million related to the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities and positive cash flow generated from operations

the actual payments will vary  in both amount and time periods  from the estimated amounts represented in this table 
see further discussion regarding insurance policy loss reserves under the critical accounting policies section 
also included in the above table is an operating lease arrangement relating to the lease of barges used in the transportation operations 
the lease was entered into in and its term is for years 
the barges can be purchased after years at a predetermined price and  at the end of the lease period in  the company can either return the barges or purchase the equipment at fair market value 
the year lease period was more attractive at that time than the traditional year financing term for conventional long term debt

the company is currently considering various financing options for the building after construction is completed 
other items no shares were repurchased in the open market under the company s share repurchase program during and a total of  shares remain authorized for repurchase under terms of this authority 
on april   the company s board of directors approved a two year extension to the share repurchase program that will run through the date of the board s second quarterly meeting in the resolution does not require the repurchase of shares  but rather gives management discretion to make purchases based on market conditions and the company s capital requirements 
the share repurchase program pertains exclusively to shares to be purchased on the open market 
this program specifically excludes shares repurchased in connection with stock incentive plans 
the company may periodically repurchase stock awarded to associates in connection with stock incentive programs 
such repurchase transactions essentially accommodate associates funding of the exercise price and any tax liabilities arising from the exercise or receipt of equity based incentive awards 
during  the company repurchased approximately million of treasury shares in connection with associate stock programs 
we paid dividends to our shareholders of million during  million in and million in we expect that our existing cash and other liquid investments  coupled with future operating cash flows and our short term borrowing capacity  will meet our operating cash requirements for the next months 

table of contents holding company operations midland and american modern are holding companies which rely primarily on dividends and management fees from subsidiaries to assist in servicing debt  paying operating expenses and paying dividends to the respective shareholders 
the payment of dividends to these holding companies from american modern s insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state regulatory agencies 
such restrictions  however  have not had  and are not expected to have  a significant impact on our  or american modern s  liquidity or our and american modern s ability to meet our respective long or short term operating  financing or capital obligations

the proceeds from these transactions are available to fund future growth and for general corporate purposes 
the debt issues have year terms and are callable any time after five years at the company s option 
the interest related to the debt is variable in nature 
the debt contains certain provisions which are typical and customary for this type of security 
investment in marketable securities the market value of midland s consolidated investment portfolio comprised primarily of the investment holdings of american modern decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was due primarily to the million decrease in unrealized appreciation in the market value of the securities held at december  compared to year end the decrease in the unrealized appreciation was due to a million decrease in unrealized appreciation related to the equity portfolio combined with a million decrease in unrealized appreciation pertaining to the fixed income portfolio

the average duration of the company s debt security investment portfolio as of december  was years which management believes provides adequate asset liability matching 
midland consolidated american modern generates cash inflows primarily from insurance premium  investment income  proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and maturities of debt security investments 
the principal cash outflows for the insurance operations relate to the payment of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  capital expenditures  income taxes  interest on debt  dividends and inter company borrowings and the purchase of marketable securities 
in each of the periods presented  funds generated from the insurance operating activities were used primarily to purchase investment grade marketable securities  accounting for the majority of the cash used in investing activities 

table of contents the amounts expended for the development costs capitalized in connection with the development of modernlink  our proprietary information systems and web enablement initiative  amounted to million in and a total of million from inception in through december  the initiative is being designed  developed and implemented in periodic phases to ensure its cost effectiveness and functionality 
this project may involve future cash expenditures of approximately million over the next three years  with additional spending thereafter to expand system compatibility and functionality 
a portion of such expenditures will be capitalized and amortized over the useful life 
however  actual costs may be more or less than what we estimate 
the cost of the development and implementation is expected to be funded out of operating cash flow 
significant changes to the technology interface between american modern and its distribution channel participants and policyholders  while unlikely  could significantly disrupt or alter its distribution channel relationships 
if the new information systems are ultimately deemed ineffective  it could result in an impairment charge to our capitalized costs 
the unamortized balance of modernlink s software development costs was million at december  american modern has a million long term credit facility available on a revolving basis at various rates 
as of december   there was million outstanding under these facilities 
during the first quarter of  american modern entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a consortium of three banks 
under the terms of this agreement  the floating interest rate related to million outstanding under american modern s long term credit facility was effectively fixed at until december   the maturity date 
after the maturity of this agreement american modern chose not to enter into a new interest rate swap agreement and has no such agreements in place at december  accounts receivable is primarily comprised of premium due from both policyholders and agents 
in the case of receivables due directly from policyholders  policies are cancelable in the event of non payment and thus offer minimal credit exposure 
approximately of american modern s accounts receivables relate to premium due directly from policyholders as of december  in the case of receivables due from agents  american modern has extended payment terms that are customary and normal in the insurance industry 
management monitors its credit exposure with its agents and related concentrations on a regular basis 
however  as collectibility of such receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the agent  american modern cannot assure collections in full 
where management believes appropriate  american modern has provided a reserve for such exposures 
accounts receivable increased million to million at december  compared to million at year end the increase is due  in part  to the increase in the use of installment billing in reinsurance recoverables and prepaid reinsurance premiums consisted of the following amounts amounts in s as of december  prepaid reinsurance premiums reinsurance recoverables unpaid losses reinsurance recoverables paid losses total the increase in reinsurance recoverables of million at december  compared to is attributable primarily to increased recoverables from catastrophe reinsurers related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 

table of contents the increase in property  plant and equipment of million at december  compared to is due to the million purchase of transportation equipment combined with the additional capitalization of expenditures related to modernlink

transportation m g transport generates its cash inflows primarily from affreightment revenue 
its primary outflows of cash relate to the payment of barge charter costs  debt service obligations  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends to midland and the acquisition of capital equipment 
like the insurance operations  cash flow from the transportation subsidiaries is expected to remain sufficiently positive to meet future operating requirements 
the transportation subsidiaries entered into a fifteen year lease in for transportation equipment 
aggregate rental payments under this operating lease over the next ten years will approximate million 
in  m g transport adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and capitalized an operating lease related to certain transportation equipment

the interest rate swap agreement expired during while the interest rate swap agreement was in place  its after tax fair value varied according to the current interest rate environment relative to the fixed rate of the swap agreement 
changes in the additional minimum pension liability are actuarially determined based on the funded status of the plans and current actuarial assumptions 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our critical accounting policies  assumptions and estimates  including those related to insurance revenue and expense recognition  loss reserves and reinsurance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
insurance revenue and expense recognition premiums for physical damage and other property and casualty related coverages  net of premium ceded to reinsurers  are recognized as income on a pro rata basis over the lives of the policies 
credit accident and health and credit life premiums are recognized as income over the lives of the policies in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
american modern generally does not consider anticipated investment income in determining premium deficiencies if any on short term contracts 
policy acquisition costs  primarily commission expenses and premium taxes  are capitalized and expensed over the terms of the related policies on the same basis as the related premiums are earned 
selling and administrative expenses that are not primarily related to premiums written are expensed as incurred 

table of contents insurance policy loss reserves american modern s reserve for insurance losses is based on past experience of settling known claims as well as estimating those not yet reported 
while management believes the amounts are fairly stated  the ultimate liability  once fully developed  may be more than or less than that provided 
management and its actuaries  both internal and external  regularly review these liabilities and adjustments are made as necessary in the current period 
management does not foresee any significant change in the manner in which it records its reserve for insurance losses 
the recorded insurance loss reserves at the balance sheet date represent the company s best estimate  based on historical patterns and other assumptions  of its liabilities at that date 
management  along with the company s internal actuaries  periodically reviews the level of loss reserves against actual loss development 
this retrospective review is the primary criteria used in refining the levels of loss reserves recorded in the financial statements 
additionally  management compares the company s estimate of loss reserves to ranges prepared by its external consulting actuaries to ensure that such estimates are within the actuaries acceptable range 
the external actuaries perform an extensive review of loss reserves at year end using generally accepted actuarial guidelines along with reviews throughout the year to ensure that the recorded loss reserves appear reasonable 
at december   loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for our property and casualty companies totaled million 
the company s estimate was affirmed by the actuaries estimated range for net loss reserves of million to million 
while management believes the amounts are fairly stated  the ultimate liability  once fully developed  may be more than or less than the recorded amount 
management believes that the likelihood that actual loss development patterns will differ significantly from past experience is low given the short tail  property oriented nature of the company s business 
however  if the ultimate pay outs would significantly exceed the expected amounts  the company has several potential options to utilize in order to satisfy the additional obligations 
for example  the company could liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or draw on conventional short term credit lines available  at costs not exceeding prime rates 
the company believes either of these options would be sufficient to meet any increases in required loss payments 
slowness to recognize or respond to new or unexpected loss patterns  such as those caused by the risk factors listed in the company s safe harbor statement  could lead to a shortage in reserves  which would lead to a higher loss and loss expense ratio  each percentage point increase in the loss and loss expense ratio would reduce income before taxes by million based on earned premiums 
reinsurance risks in order to limit its exposure to certain levels of risks  the company cedes varying portions of its written premiums to other insurance companies 
as such  the company limits its loss exposure to that portion of the insurable risk it retains 
in addition  the company pays a percentage of earned premiums to reinsurers in return for coverage against catastrophic losses 
however  if a reinsurer fails to honor its obligations  american modern could suffer additional losses as the reinsurance contracts do not relieve american modern of its obligations to policyholders 
american modern and its independent reinsurance brokers regularly conduct market security evaluations of both its current and prospective reinsurers 
such evaluations include a complete review of each reinsurer s financial condition along with an assessment of credit risk concentrations arising from similar geographic regions  activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
the specific evaluation procedures include  but are not limited to  reviewing the periodic financial statements and ratings assigned to each reinsurer from rating agencies such as s p  moody s and am best 
during  approximately of the company s catastrophe reinsurers had an am best or s p rating of a or higher 

table of contents in addition  american modern may  in some cases  require reinsurers to establish trust funds and maintain letters of credit to further minimize possible exposures 
all reinsurance amounts owed to american modern are current and management believes that no allowance for uncollectible accounts related to this recoverable is necessary 
management also believes there is no significant concentration of credit risk arising from any single reinsurer 
the company also assumes a limited amount of business on certain reinsurance contracts 
related premiums and loss reserves are recorded based on records supplied by the ceding companies 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities american modern invests in various securities including us government securities  corporate debt securities  and corporate stocks 
investment securities in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  credit  and overall market volatility 
due to the level of risk associated with these securities  it is reasonably possible that changes in the value of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material 
in order to identify other than temporary impairments  we conduct quarterly comprehensive reviews of individual portfolio holdings that have a market value less than their respective carrying value 
as part of our review for other than temporary impairment  we track the respective carrying values and market values for all individual securities with an unrealized loss 
we  with the assistance of our external professional money managers  apply both quantitative and qualitative criteria in our evaluation  including facts specific to each individual investment such as  but not limited to  the length of time the fair value has been below the carrying value  the extent of the decline  our intent to sell or hold the security  the expectation for each individual security s performance  the credit worthiness and related liquidity of the issuer and the issuer s business sector 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairment requires a significant amount of judgment 
as such  there are a number of risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring for potential impairments and determining if a decline is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the risks that the economic outlook is worse than anticipated and has a greater adverse impact on a particular issuer than anticipated 
our assessment of a particular issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations changes based on changes in the facts and circumstances related to the issuer 
new information is obtained or facts and circumstances change that cause a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
when a security is considered other than temporarily impaired  we monitor trends or circumstances that may impact other material investments in our portfolio 
for example  we review any other securities that are held in the portfolio from the same issuer and also consider any circumstances that may impact other securities of issuers in the same industry 
at december   we had no significant concentration of unrealized losses in any one issuer  industry or sector 
for fixed income and equity securities  we consider the following factors  among others  to determine if a security is other than temporarily impaired the extent and duration to which market value is less than cost 
table of contents historical operating performance of the security issuer news releases  including those disclosing that the issuer has committed an event of default missed payment beyond grace period  bankruptcy filing  loss of principle customer or supplier  debt downgrade  disposal of segment  etc 
near term prospects for improvement of the issuer and or its industry to include relevant industry conditions and trends industry research and communications with industry specialists third party research reports credit rating reports financial models and expectations discussions with issuer s management by investment manager our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery time to conversion with respect to a mandatory convertible security for fixed income securities  we also consider the following factors the recoverability of principal and interest the issuer s ability to continue to make obligated payments to security holders the current interest rate environment the investment portfolio is comprised of various asset classes which are independently managed by external professional portfolio managers under the oversight and guidelines established by our investment committee 
we evaluate the performance of the portfolio managers relative to benchmarks we believe appropriate given the asset class 
investment managers will manage the portfolio under these guidelines to maximize the return on their investment class 
as part of their investment strategy  the investment managers will buy and sell securities based on changes in the availability of  and the yield on  alternative investments 
investment managers may also buy and sell investments to diversify risk  attain a specific characteristic such as duration or credit quality  rebalance or reposition the portfolio or for a variety of other reasons 
it is our intent  and thus the intent of our investment managers  to hold securities that have an unrealized gain or loss 
for the securities with an unrealized loss  which in our judgment we believe to be temporary  it is our intent to hold the security for a period of time that will allow the security to recover in value 
however  if the investment managers believe returns would be enhanced by selling the security and reinvesting the proceeds  the managers may do so  in which case the unrealized gain or loss will be recognized as a realized gain or loss 
as part of our comprehensive quarterly review for other than temporary impairment  the investment managers identify any securities in which they have the intent to sell in the near term 
in the case where investment managers have indicated their intent to sell a security in the near term and there is an unrealized loss  we record an other than temporary impairment at the balance sheet date  if such date is prior to the sale of the security 
at december   we had no securities with an unrealized loss for which a decision was made to sell in the near term 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred no losses related to other than temporary impairments 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in other than temporary impairment losses 
impairment charges are included in the consolidated financial statements in net realized investment gains losses 
defined benefit pension plans midland maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of active participants

in determining our expected 
table of contents long term rate of return and our discount rate  we evaluate input from our actuaries  asset allocations  long term bond yields and historical performance of the invested pension assets over a ten year period

in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop sop provides accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
internal replacement contracts are those that are substantially changed from the replaced contract and are accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract 
nonintegrated contract features are accounted for as separately issued contracts 
modifications resulting from the election of a feature or coverage within a contract or from an integrated contract feature generally do not result in an internal replacement contract subject to sop provided certain conditions are met 
the provisions of sop are effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  the sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp fas  which nullifies the guidance in paragraphs of eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
fsp fas clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell the security has not been made  and also provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for an impaired debt security 
fsp fas is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation we do not consider the impact of the change in prices due to inflation to be material in the analysis of our overall operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur investment losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposures are substantially related to the company s investment portfolio and changes in interest rates and equity prices 
each risk is defined in more detail as follows 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the risk arises from many of the company s investment activities  as the company invests substantial funds in interest sensitive assets 
the company manages the interest rate risk inherent in its investment assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in its liabilities 
one of the measures the company uses to quantify this exposure is duration 
by definition  duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the fair value of a fixed income portfolio to changes in interest rates 
based upon the year duration of the company s fixed income portfolio as of december   management estimates that a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the market value of its million debt security portfolio by  or million 
equity price risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock or stock index 
the company s equity exposure consists primarily of declines in the value of its equity security holdings 
as of december   the company had million in equity holdings  including million of us bancorp common stock 
a decrease in the market value of us bancorp s common stock would decrease the fair value of its equity portfolio by approximately million 
as of december   the remainder of the company s portfolio of equity securities had a beta coefficient a measure of stock price volatility of 
this means that  in general  if the s p index decreases by  management estimates that the fair value of the remaining equity portfolio will decrease by 
the active management of market risk is integral to the company s operations 
the company has investment guidelines that define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including the accountabilities and controls over these activities
