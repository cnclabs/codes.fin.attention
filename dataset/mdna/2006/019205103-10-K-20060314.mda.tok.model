item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company is a new york corporation  which was formed in november as a result of the merger of cortland first financial corporation and oneida valley bancshares  inc 
the company is a bank holding company that operates one wholly owned banking subsidiary  alliance bank  na  which provides a full range of financial services in the central new york marketplace 
the following discussion and analysis reviews the company s business  and provides information that is intended to provide the reader with a further understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company and its operating subsidiaries 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  and other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  accrued income taxes  and the fair value analysis of the intangible asset to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable loan and lease losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is included in this report 
the company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the consolidated financial statements section of this report 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the corporation s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from our estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the company utilizes significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of its intangible asset for purposes of impairment testing 
the valuation requires the use of assumptions  including  among others  discount rates  rates of return on assets  account attrition rates and costs of servicing 
results of operations earnings summary and executive overview net income for was  an increase of  or  compared to net income of  in earnings per share for  on a fully diluted basis  were  up  or per share  compared to per share in basic earnings per share of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  strong growth in the bank s earning assets continued in  with average loans and leases up while average deposits grew at a record rate

the bank originated  in residential mortgage loans in compared to  in the increase in the growth rate in originations is primarily the result of an increase in the average loan size as the housing market continued its robust growth in the numbers of new mortgage loans booked were comparable year over year  with and for and  respectively 
the bank s mortgage portfolio objective was to continue its strategy of reducing the relative size of the residential mortgage loan portfolio  and the percentage that the primarily long term fixed rate portfolio was to total loans 
as a result  the percentage of residential mortgage loans to net loans and leases declined from at year end to at year end during the bank sold  in mortgage loans  which was comparable with the volume of loans sold in  and as of year end was servicing loans with balances of  the servicing portfolio increased  or  during the indirect auto loan portfolio in increased  or  over the prior year  following an increase of  or  in compared to the rate of portfolio growth was enhanced in by the continued expansion of the western new york auto dealer network

the majority of originations were recorded during the first three quarters of during the fourth quarter the bank repositioned its pricing to manage volume to a lower level

the loss taken on the sale was included in the total of commercial loans charged off 
by comparison  a decline in non performing loans  leases  and assets in compared with resulted from the charge off of a single non performing commercial loan in the allowance to nonperforming loans and leases ratio improved from at year end to at year end total delinquencies  defined as loans and leases days or more past due and nonaccruing  were of total loans and leases outstanding as of december   compared to at the end of month end delinquency rates during ranged from to and the company does not believe that the increase in the delinquency rate at the comparative year end dates is indicative of any deterioration in the portfolio 
the bank has a loan and lease review program that it believes takes a conservative approach to evaluating nonperforming loans and leases and the loan and lease portfolio in general 
the loan and lease review program continually audits the loan and lease portfolio to confirm management s loan and lease risk rating system  and tracks problem loans and leases to insure compliance with loan and lease policy underwriting guidelines  and to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank s policy is to place a loan or lease on nonaccrual status and recognize income on a cash basis when a loan or lease is more than ninety days past due  unless in the opinion of management  the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection 
the impact of interest not recognized on nonaccrual loans and leases was  in and was  in the bank considers a loan or lease impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due accord ing to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans and leases is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans and leases are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral 
as of december  and  there were no impaired loans or leases for which specific valuation allowances had been recorded 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of probable loan and lease losses in the bank s loan and lease portfolio 
management s quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses is a comprehensive analysis that builds a total reserve by evaluating the risks within each loan and lease type  or pool  of similar loans and leases 
the bank uses a general allocation methodology for all residential and consumer loan pools 
this methodology estimates a reserve for each pool based on the most recent three year loss rate  adjusted to reflect the expected impact that current trends regarding loan growth  delinquency  losses  economic conditions  loan concentrations  policy changes and current interest rates are likely to have 
for commercial loan and lease pools  the bank establishes a specific reserve allocation for all loans and leases in excess of  which have been risk rated under the bank s risk rating system  as substandard or doubtful 
the specific allocation is based on the most recent valuation of the loan or lease collateral 
for all other commercial loans and leases  the bank uses the general allocation methodology that establishes a reserve for each risk rating category 
the general allocation methodology for commercial loans and leases considers the same qualitative factors that are considered when evaluating residential mortgage and consumer loan pools 
the combination of using both the general and specific allocation methodologies reflects man agement s best estimate of the probable loan and lease losses in the bank s loan and lease portfolio 
loans and leases are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses  in accordance with the bank s loan and lease policy  when they are determined by management to be uncollectible 
recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses when they are received 
when management determines that the allowance for loan and lease losses is less than adequate to provide for potential losses  a direct charge is made to operating income 
the following table summarizes loan and lease balances at the end of each period indicated and the daily average amount of loans and leases 
also summarized are changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses arising from loans and leases charged off and recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off and additions to the allowance  which have been charged to expense

net loans and leases charged off in declined compared with  to  from  and the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases fell to from for the comparable periods 
the decline in the loss rate reflected a reduction of  or more than  in commercial loan losses  and a  or  reduction in indirect auto loan losses compared with there were no net losses in the residential real estate or lease portfolios  and consumer loan losses were comparable with the loss rate of the prior year 
the decline in the indirect auto loan loss rate over the past five years reflects a tightening of the bank s loan underwriting guidelines in combined with an effective collection program over the period 
over the past three years  over of new indirect auto loans have been originated in the bank s premium or level a fico score or above credit quality categories

under the terms of the agreements  the bank sells investment portfolio securities to the customer and agrees to repurchase the securities on the next business day 
the bank uses this arrangement as a deposit alternative for its business customers 
as of december   retail repurchase agreement balances amounted to  compared to balances of  at december  during  the bank utilized collateralized repurchase agreements with various brokers and advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb as alternative sources of funding and as a liability management tool 
at december   the combination of repurchase agreements and fhlb advances were  compared to  at december  the decline in the company s investment portfolio funded the reduction in borrowings 
detailed information regarding the company s borrowings is included in note in the consolidated financial statements section of this report 
in december  the company formed alliance financial capital trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the trust was formed for the purpose of issuing  of company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities the capital securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such capital securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the company 
the debentures held by the trust are the sole assets of that trust 
distributions on the capital securities issued by the trust are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate being earned by the trust on the debentures held by the trust 
the capital securities have a variable annual coupon rate that resets quarterly based upon three month libor plus basis points 
the capital securities have a year maturity and are redeemable at par in january and any time thereafter 
capital in  the company added  into equity through net income  declared dividends to shareholders in the amount of  and increased undivided profits by  during the year  the company s equity increased  due to the issuance of  shares of stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and  in connection with the issuance of restricted stock 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during the year at a cost of  pursuant to a stock repurchase program 
shares repurchased under the program were acquired on the open market and are held in treasury 
total shareholders equity also reflects an adjustment for the change in market value of the company s available for sale investment securities 
as previously discussed under investment securities the after tax effect of the net unrealized gains and losses is reported as the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  and reflects a decrease in total shareholders equity of  for the year ended december  the company s ratio of shareholders equity to total assets of at december  compares to at december  the company s goal is to maintain a strong capital position  consistent with the risk profile of the bank  that supports growth and expansion activities while at the same time exceeding regulatory standards 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
at december   the company exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution 
a more comprehensive analysis of regulatory capital requirements  including ratios for the company  is included in note in the consolidated financial statements 
the company declared cash dividends equal to per share in which was comparable to the level 
the dividend pay out ratio of was comparable with the pay out ratio in of and is in accordance with the company s current intention to maintain a dividend pay out ratio at or about  subject to applicable regulatory restrictions and operational funding requirements 
liquidity the company s liquidity is primarily measured by the bank s ability to provide funds to meet loan and lease requests  to accommodate possible outflows of deposits  and to take advantage of market interest rate opportunities 
funding of loan and lease requests  providing for liability outflows  and management of interest rate fluctuations requires continuous analysis in order to match the maturities of specific categories of short term loans and leases and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature and mix of the bank s sources and uses of funds 
the asset liability management committee alco of the bank is responsible for implementing the policies and guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
management believes  as of december   that liquidity as measured by the bank is in compliance with its policy guidelines 
the bank s principal sources of funds for operations are cash flows generated from earnings  deposits  loan and lease repayments  borrowings from the fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
during the twelve months ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased by  as net cash provided by operating activities and deposit and financing activities of  exceeded the net cash used in lending and investing activities of  net cash provided by deposit and financing activities reflects a net increase in deposits of  and a net reduction in borrowings of  net cash used in lending and investing activities reflects a net increase in loans of  a net reduction in investment securities of  a net increase in premises and equipment of  and  used for the acquisition of a portfolio of personal trust accounts and related assets under management from hsbc  usa  na and certain related expenses 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank is eligible to borrow up to an established credit limit against certain residential mortgage loans and investment securities that have been pledged as collateral 
as of december   the bank s credit limit with the fhlb was  with outstanding borrowings in the amount of  contractual obligations  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations the following table presents as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligation note reference one year or less one to three years payments due in three to five years over five years total dollars in thousands time deposits federal funds purchased and agreements to repurchase securities short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases purchase obligations total excludes interest the company also has obligations under its postretirement plan as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the postretirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future benefit payments to eligible plan participants 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  held for purposes other than trading 
the financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument  for loan commitments and standby letters of credit  is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments  assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that collateral or other security is of no value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
commitments to originate loans  unused lines of credit  and un advanced portions of construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the amounts presented below do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  further discussion of these commitments and off balance sheet arrangements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

the provision for loan and lease losses for the fourth quarter of was  compared with  for the third quarter of  and  for the fourth quarter of the lower provision expense in compared with reflects improvement in credit quality  particularly in commercial loans 
see the preceding section entitled loan quality and the allowance for loan and lease losses for further discussion of the provision for loan and lease losses 
non interest income was  for the fourth quarter of  compared with  in the prior quarter  and  in the fourth quarter of the increase over the fourth quarter was attributable to growth in trust income due to the purchase of the hsbc trust assets 
operating expense was  for the fourth quarter of  up from the immediately preceding quarter and from the same quarter a year ago 
the fourth quarter included approximately  in one time employee severance costs and contractual service fees associated with an earnings improvement project 
on a year over year basis  operating expense also increased due to higher salary and benefits expense and intangible amortization costs related to the acquisition of the trust business 
average total assets for the fourth quarter of were  up from  in the third quarter of the growth in average total assets reflects an increase in portfolio loans  primarily in the indirect auto and lease categories

the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
other types of market risks do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the bank s alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the policies and guidelines established by alco are reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of two complementary measures earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
both measures are highly assumption dependent and change regularly as the balance sheet and business mix evolve  however  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
the key assumptions employed by these measures are analyzed regularly and reviewed by alco 
earnings simulation modeling net interest income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates and by changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flattening of the yield curve would result in a decline in earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening of the yield curve would result in increased earnings as investment margins widen 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve though time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds in conjunction with the historical prepayment performance of the bank s loans 
non contractual deposit growth rates and pricing are modeled on historical patterns 
interest rates of the various assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are assumed to change proportionally  based on their historic relationship to short term rates 
the bank s guidelines for risk management call for preventative measures to be taken if the simulation modeling demonstrates that an instantaneous increase or decrease in short term rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than when compared to the stable rate scenario 
at december   based on the results of our simulation model and assuming that management does not take action to alter the outcome  the bank would expect net interest income to decrease if short term interest rates increase by  and increase if short term interest rates decline by 
by comparison  at december   based on the results of our simulation model  and assuming that management did not take action to alter the outcome  the bank expected net interest income to decline if short term interest rates increased by  and increase if short term interest rates declined by 
net present value estimation the net present value of equity npv measure is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the earnings simulation model due to the shorter time horizon used by that model 
the npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of the asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the company s npv analysis models both an instantaneous increasing and decreasing interest rate scenario comparing the npv in each scenario to the npv in the current rate scenario 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
the npv measure assumes a static balance sheet versus the growth assumptions that are incorporated into the earnings simulation measure  and an unlimited time horizon instead of the one year horizon applied in the earnings simulation model 
as with earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and the variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are assumptions driving mortgage prepayments in both the loan and investment portfolios  and changes in the noncontractual deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently in both models 
based on the december  npv analysis  a instantaneous increase in interest rates was estimated to decrease npv by 
npv was estimated to increase if rates immediately declined by 
the company s policy guidelines limit the amount of the estimated decline increase to in a rate change scenario 
by comparison  the december  npv analysis estimated a instantaneous increase in interest rates would decrease npv by 
npv was estimated to decline if rates immediately declined by the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  expected maturity principal repayments at december  there after total average interest rate fair value dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets loans and leases investments total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities savings  money market  and now accounts time deposits borrowings total rate sensitive liabilities expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayment of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the actual maturities and run off of loans and leases could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s historical experience 
for liabilities  expected maturities are contractual maturities for time deposits and borrowings 
non maturity liabilities have estimated maturities based on an analysis that considers the historic stability of the balances and the competitiveness of the company s pricing  for each account type
