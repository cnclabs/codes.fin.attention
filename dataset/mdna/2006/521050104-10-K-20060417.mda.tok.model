management overview of reportable operating segments the company is a multinational company that provides sophisticated drilling and construction services and related products to a variety of markets  as well as being a producer of unconventional natural gas for the energy market 
management defines the company s operational organizational structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results of those services are recorded in the office s own division 
for example  if a water resources division office performed geoconstruction services  the revenues would be recorded in the water resources division rather than the geoconstruction division 
should an office s primary responsibility move from one division president to another  that office s results going forward would be reclassified between divisions at that time 
the company s reportable segments are defined as follows water resources division this division provides a full line of water related services and products including hydrological studies  site selection  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  and repair and maintenance 
the division s offerings include the design and construction of water treatment facilities and the manufacture and sale of products to treat volatile organics and other contaminants such as nitrates  iron  manganese  arsenic  radium and radon in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
with the acquisition of reynolds in september  the division expanded its capabilities in the areas of the design and build of water and wastewater treatment plants  ranney collector wells  sewer rehabilitation and water and wastewater transmission lines 
the division s operations rely heavily on the municipal sector as approximately of the division s fiscal revenues were derived from the municipal market 
the municipal sector has been adversely impacted by economic slowdowns in certain regions of the country 
reduced tax revenues can limit spending and new development by local municipalities 
generally  spending levels in the municipal sector lag an economic recovery 
in certain markets  the company has experienced reduced spending levels in the municipal market and reduced demand for its services in the industrial markets 
the soft markets have increased the competitive challenges for the division as competitors have been very aggressive on pricing 
the company expects activity levels within the water markets to improve 
the division is also expanding its water treatment product offerings and expects to see continued growth in water treatment sales in fiscal mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in fiscal  the mineral exploration division experienced the first increase in worldwide exploration spending since  driven primarily by increased gold and base metal prices 
the division relies heavily on mining activity in africa where of total division revenues were generated for fiscal the company believes this concentration of risk is mitigated by working for larger international mining companies and the establishment of permanent operating facilities in africa 
operating difficulties  including but not limited to  political instability  workforce instability  harsh environment  disease and remote locations  all create natural barriers to entry in this market by competitors 
the company believes it has positioned itself as the market leader in africa and has established the infrastructure to operate effectively 
the division expects to experience continued growth next year as mining activity remains strong 
geoconstruction division this division focuses on services that improve soil stability  primarily jet grouting  grouting  vibratory ground improvement  drilled micropiles  stone columns  anchors and tiebacks 
the division also manufactures a line of high pressure pumping equipment used in grouting operations and geotechnical drilling rigs used for directional drilling 
the geoconstruction division frequently acts as a subcontractor to heavy civil construction contractors and governmental agencies 
in many cases  circumstances outside of the company s control are inherent in a subcontractor relationship 
consequently  the division could experience delays on projects that could have a material adverse effect on the division 
energy division this division focuses entirely on exploration and production of unconventional gas properties in the united states 
to date this division has been concentrated on projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
historically  the division also included service businesses in shallow gas and tar sands exploration drilling  conventional oilfield fishing services and coil tubing fishing services 
during fiscal  the division s strategy shifted to focus mainly on resource development rather than providing services to external customers 
accordingly  in january  the division sold its shallow gas and tar sands exploration business and oilfield fishing services 
the results of operations for these units have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all years presented see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the division completed its shift in focus to unconventional gas development activities and has reclassified the results of its two small  specialty energy service companies to the other division 
the expansion of the company s energy segment is contingent upon significant cash investments to develop the company s unproved acreage 
as of january   the company has invested  in oil and gas related assets and expects to spend approximately  in development activities in fiscal the production curve for a typical unconventional gas well in the company s operating market is generally years 
accordingly  the company expects to earn a return on its investment through proceeds from gas production over the next years 
however  future revenues and profits will be dependent upon a number of factors including consumption levels for natural gas  commodity prices  the economic feasibility of gas exploration and production and the discovery rate of new gas reserves 
the company has gross producing wells on line as of january  other other includes two small specialty energy service companies previously classified in the energy division and any other specialty operations not included in one of the other divisions

gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decreases in gross profit percentage were primarily the result of reduced margins in the water resources division arising from a change in product mix with the acquisition of reynolds  higher than expected costs on certain water supply contracts especially in the california market and competitive pricing pressures in texas 
these decreases were partially offset by improved margins in the energy division due to the increased sales of natural gas as a result of increased production and pricing 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal and of revenues  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to the acquisition of reynolds in september  the acquisition of beylik drilling and pump service  inc beylik in october  expansion of the company s water treatment capabilities and additional accrued incentive compensation expense as a result of improved profitability of the company 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increased depreciation associated with the property and equipment purchased in the reynolds and beylik acquisitions and increased depletion expense resulting from the increase in production of unconventional gas from the company s energy operations 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  reflecting increased activity by the company s latin american affiliates and a joint venture in the geoconstruction division 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was a result of an increase in the company s average borrowings during the year in conjunction with the financing of reynolds 
other  net was  for fiscal and  for fiscal  which primarily related to gains on sales of property and equipment resulting from the company s efforts to monetize non strategic assets 
the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended january   compared to for the year ended january  the effective rate in excess of the statutory federal rate for the periods was due primarily to the impact of nondeductible expenses and the tax treatment of certain foreign operations 
water resources division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes water resources revenues increased to  for the year ended january   from  for the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the reynolds and beylik acquisitions and the division s water treatment initiatives 
income from continuing operations for the water resources division decreased to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily the result of higher than expected costs on certain water supply contracts especially in the california market  competitive pricing pressures in the texas market and additional costs of approximately  associated with the introduction of membrane technology to the division s water treatment initiatives 
mineral exploration division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes mineral exploration revenues increased to  for the year ended january   compared to revenues of  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased exploration activity in the company s markets due to higher gold and base metal prices 
income from continuing operations for the mineral exploration division increased to  for the year ended january   compared to income from continuing operations of  for the year ended january  the improved earnings in the division were primarily due to the increased activity levels noted above and increased earnings by the company s latin american affiliates partially offset by difficult operating conditions in africa 
equity earnings from the latin american affiliates were  for fiscal and  for fiscal the improvements in earnings for the division were partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs 
geoconstruction division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes geoconstruction revenues increased to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to strong sales in the fourth quarter from the company s manufacturing operations in italy 
the geoconstruction division s income from continuing operations increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in income from continuing operations was attributable to an increase of  in equity in earnings from a joint venture substantially completed in fiscal  additional earnings from the manufacturing products described above and the settlement of several contract change orders 
energy division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income loss from continuing operations before income taxes energy division revenues increased to  for the year ended january  compared to revenues of  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased production from the company s unconventional gas properties and higher natural gas prices 
the division had income from continuing operations of  for the year ended january   compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended january  the increase in income was due to the increase in production of unconventional gas and certain overhead cost reductions 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year was primarily due to lower professional fees for sarbanes oxley requirements  a decrease in incentive related expenses for corporate personnel and charges in the second quarter of the prior year related to the write down of non strategic assets of  comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues for fiscal increased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues primarily resulted from increased activity in the mineral exploration and water resource divisions 
a further discussion of results of operations by division is presented below 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage for the year was primarily attributable to pricing pressures in the water resources division along with reduced margins associated with the promotion of certain new water treatment products 
the decrease in the water resources division margins was partially offset by increased margins in the mineral exploration division due to increased drilling activity because of higher gold and base metal prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal and of revenues  respectively 
the dollar increase for the year was primarily related to incremental costs of approximately  associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley requirements  increased incentive compensation costs as a result of the company s increased profitability and increased expenses associated with the company s unconventional gas development efforts 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was the result of increased depletion associated with the expansion of the company s energy operations  increased depreciation from new asset additions in the mineral exploration division due to increased demand and in the water resources division primarily from assets purchased in the previously announced beylik acquisition 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was a result of an increase in the company s average borrowings during the year 
the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of  for fiscal the loss represents prepayment penalties and the write off of associated deferred fees in connection with refinancing of the company s debts 
other income included  for fiscal and  for fiscal which primarily related to gains on sales of property and equipment resulting from the company s efforts to monetize non strategic assets 
income tax expense of  related to continuing operations was recorded for fiscal an effective rate of  compared to  for the same period last year an effective rate of 
the improvement in the effective rate is primarily attributable to improved earnings in international operations 
the remaining difference in the effective rate versus the statutory federal rate was due primarily to the impact of nondeductible expenses and the tax treatment of certain foreign operations 
net income for fiscal included a loss from discontinued operations of  net of income tax benefit of  primarily due to residual costs and foreign exchange losses from the company s subsidiary  layne christensen canada  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company also sold its subsidiary toledo oil and gas in fiscal both entities were historically reported as part of the company s energy segment 
in connection with the sales  the company recorded a gain in fiscal of  net of income taxes of  the gain related to the sale of these operations was offset by operating losses of  net of income taxes of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
water resources division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes water resources revenues increased to  for the year ended january   from  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was attributable to the increased infrastructure needs as a result of population expansion in metropolitan areas  primarily the western united states  improvements in municipal spending in certain regions and the results of the company s water treatment initiatives 
income from continuing operations for the water resources division increased to  for the year ended january   compared to  last year 
the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily the combination of increased gross profit associated with the volume increase in revenues and essentially flat selling  general and administrative expenses 
mineral exploration division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes mineral exploration revenues increased to  for the year ended january   compared to revenues of  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased exploration activity in the company s markets due to higher gold and base metal prices 
income from continuing operations for the mineral exploration division was  for the year ended january   compared to income from continuing operations of  for the year ended january  the improved earnings in the division were primarily due to the increased activity levels noted above and increased earnings by the company s latin american affiliates 
equity earnings from the latin american affiliates were  for fiscal and  for fiscal the improvements in earnings for the division were partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs and additional depreciation on new asset additions 
geoconstruction division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes geoconstruction revenues increased to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to certain larger than normal private sector projects 
the geoconstruction division s income from continuing operations increased to  in compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in income from continuing operations was attributable to improved profit margins from the larger private sector projects noted above 
energy division in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes energy division revenues increased to  for the year ended january   compared to revenues of  for the year ended january  the increase in revenue resulted from increased production from the company s unconventional gas projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
the division had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended january   compared to a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended january  the increased loss for the division was the result of increased expenses related to the company s development of unconventional gas properties 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily the result of increased costs associated with the sarbanes oxley implementation requirements and higher travel expenses 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling and construction activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to project sites  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year

inflation management believes that the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities

the company was in compliance with its financial covenants at january  and expects to remain in compliance through the foreseeable future 
the company s working capital as of january   and  was   and  respectively 
the increase in working capital at january  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of reynolds  which incrementally increased working capital by approximately  this increase was partially offset by approximately  in accrued purchase price adjustments  an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals due to the increased profitability of the company 
as of january   the company had no material commitments outstanding for capital assets 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet the company s operating cash requirements and to fund its budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal operating activities cash from operating activities were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth was primarily due to increased earnings and improved management of working capital levels 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures of  for fiscal were directed primarily toward the company s expansion into unconventional gas exploration and production 
expenditures related to the company s unconventional gas efforts totaled  during fiscal including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
as a part of these expenditures  the company acquired two unconventional gas projects totaling  and acquired the remaining interest in a gas transportation facility for  the company s remaining capital expenditures were directed towards expansion and upgrading of equipment and facilities primarily in the water resources and mineral exploration divisions 
in september  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of reynolds for total consideration of  in cash and approximately million shares of common stock of the company 
reynolds is a major supplier of products and services to the water and wastewater industries including the design build of water and wastewater treatment plants  water supply wells  ranney collector wells  water intakes and water and wastewater transmission lines

financing activities for the year ended january   the company borrowed  under its credit facilities primarily for the reynolds acquisition  working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures 
additionally  proceeds were received from issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options 
the increase in the exercise of stock options was due to increases in the company s stock price and a number of options with impending expiration dates 
financing activities also include payments of  related to the drillcorp promissory note  which was paid in full in fiscal in fiscal  the company s financing activities primarily related to the issuance of  in notes under the master shelf agreement to fund the acquisitions of beylik and unconventional gas related assets totaling  in addition  the borrowings were used for working capital requirements  capital expenditures and the payment of  for the drillcorp promissory note 
in fiscal  proceeds from option exercises were unusually high due to increases in the company s stock price and a large number of options with impending expiration dates

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  located in item of this form k 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on large  long term contracts using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  change orders and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
revenue is recognized on smaller  short term contracts using the completed contract method 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
goodwill and other intangibles the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to years 
the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives  then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
other long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  including the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reduces their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of its long lived assets continues to be appropriate 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a self insured limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee medical benefits  property  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of funds considered to be invested indefinitely 
oil and gas properties and mineral interests the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
the company is required to review the carrying value of its oil and gas properties each quarter under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenues at the unescalated prices in effect as of the last day of the period  with effect given to the company s fixed price physical delivery contracts  and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis using a comparison of the carrying values of the unproved properties to net future cash flows 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change
