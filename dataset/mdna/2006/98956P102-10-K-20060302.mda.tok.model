item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
overview we are a global leader in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants  including joint and dental  spinal implants  trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as osp 
reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees  hips  shoulders and elbows 
dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease 
spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases  deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine 
trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body s natural healing process 
osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation 
we have operations in more than countries and market products in more than countries 
we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the americas  europe and asia pacific 
we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is the same as sales growth when compared to on a pro forma basis 
we believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population  obesity  proven clinical benefits  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques such as our mis procedures and technologies and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the continued shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity  durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes  trabecular metal technology products  high flex knees  knee revision products and porous hip stems  continue to positively affect sales growth 
for example  during the year ended december   sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over million  an increase of nearly percent over we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry 
we have made significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants  procedures and technologies 
during the year ended december   the zimmer institute and its satellite locations trained nearly  surgeons on advanced techniques  including over  surgeons on mis procedures  which is approximately percent greater than the number of surgeons trained last year 
pricing trends selling price increases contributed percentage point of sales growth during the year ended december  compared to percentage points in when compared to on a pro forma basis 
the reduced benefit from selling price increases in compared to is primarily attributed to the americas operating segment 
the americas experienced a percent increase in selling prices during the year ended december   compared to a percent increase in on a pro forma basis 
we believe the slower growth in selling price increases was primarily due to hospital cost containment efforts 
in europe  selling prices for the year ended december  decreased percent  compared to a negligible effect in on a pro forma basis 
within europe  germany  which constitutes approximately percent of our sales  experienced a percent decrease in selling prices in the year ended december   as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates 
the decline in germany was partially offset by increased selling prices in other european markets 
asia pacific selling prices had a negligible effect on sales for the year ended december   compared to a percent decrease in on a pro forma basis 
effective april   the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates  which contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in japan by approximately percent during the year ended december   on a pro forma basis 
the negative effect of this decrease in japan occurred only in the first quarter of  as the anniversary of the price reductions was april  japan represents approximately percent of our sales 
the next japanese reimbursement change is expected to be april   and therefore  we expect japanese selling prices to remain the same through the first quarter of compared to the same period in the prior year 
we expect the japanese government to reduce reimbursement rates again at that time 
we estimate this reduction will affect japan sales negatively by approximately percent for the year ending december   based upon zimmer japan s portfolio of reconstructive and trauma products 
with pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and group purchasing organizations  we estimate the unaudited pro forma net sales information for  including comparisons to net sales  contained in this form k and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles has been derived from the audited financial statements of zimmer holdings for the year ended december  and the financial statements of centerpulse for the nine months ended september  to give effect to the centerpulse acquisition as if it had occurred on january  
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k global sales could decline by approximately percent in due to selling price decreases 
foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december   foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on global sales growth 
however  a stronger us dollar compared to most foreign currencies in the three month period ended december   compared to the same period  decreased sales by percentage points 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates  we estimate that weaker foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect of approximately percent on sales for the year ended december  we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities  and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to offsetting gains losses on hedge contracts  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
new product sales new products  which management defines as products or stock keeping units sku s introduced within the prior month period to a particular market  accounted for percent  or million  of our sales during the year ended december  adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of industry performance 
our sales have grown with the introduction of new products  such as trabecular metal modular acetabular cups  certain sku s of the nexgen complete knee solution for the lps  lps flex  and cr flex knees  and the dynesys dynamic stabilization system 
we believe new products in our current pipeline should continue to favorably affect our operating performance 
products we expect to contribute to new product sales in include products incorporating trabecular metal technology  including a hip stem and humeral shoulder  the versys epoch composite full coat hip prosthesis  the nexgen mis tibial plate  various trauma products including new zimmer periarticular locking plates and the sirus intramedullary nail system released to the us market  and alternative bearing surfaces including ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal 
acquisition of centerpulse we are near completion of our integration plan for centerpulse 
in the fourth quarter of  we ceased manufacturing operations at our austin  texas facility 
remaining integration milestones relate to it systems conversions  primarily in europe and asia pacific  the residual costs of decommissioning the austin facility and disposing of this asset  continued in sourcing and a few miscellaneous items 
we expect to complete the integration plan for centerpulse by the end of net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of centerpulse were approximately million in we define net synergies as expense synergies less operating profit reductions resulting from integration related sales losses and increases in operating expenses directly resulting from the acquisition 
with the majority of our manufacturing integration plan completed  additional expense synergies should be realized in and as the inventory produced after the completion of the integration plan is sold 
operating expense synergies  principally in selling  general and administrative expenses  have exceeded our original expectations  reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies 
we estimate our integration related sales losses and increased operating expenses were approximately million in expense synergies for are expected to be in excess of million 
we expect these synergies will be slightly offset by sales losses and increased operating expenses 
we incurred million of acquisition and integration expenses during the year ended december   and expect to incur million of acquisition and integration expenses in acquisition of implex we completed the acquisition of implex on april  we had a strategic alliance with implex since for the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating trabecular metal technology 
pursuant to the strategic alliance  we sold products incorporating trabecular metal technology  which represented over percent of implex sales 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
we adopted this accounting standard using the prospective method and will not restate prior periods 
we estimate the adoption of this accounting standard will reduce diluted earnings per share by during the year ended december  however  this is a non cash expense and will not have an effect on our net cash flows

other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were reduced inventory charges due to improved inventory management  increased selling prices  favorable resolution of certain legal and other matters and reduced royalties 
royalty expenses as a percentage of sales declined due to a favorable mix of non royalty bearing sales 
operating expenses r d as a percentage of net sales was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent in r d increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  reflecting increased spending on projects focused on areas of strategic significance  including orthobiologics

currently  our product pipeline consists of more than active projects 
we are also investing in mis procedures and technologies  material technologies  including woven materials and drug device combinations and intelligence technologies  including sensor technology 
we delivered more than projects to the market in we target r d spending to the high end of what management believes to be an average of percent for the industry 
sg a as a percentage of net sales was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent in the decrease was primarily due to sales growth and realized expense synergies

operating profit  income taxes and net earnings operating profit for the year ended december  increased percent to  million  from million in increased sales  improved gross profit margins  realized operating expense synergies  controlled operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration expenses drove operating profit 
the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to percent for the year ended december   from percent in the provision for income taxes in included a million benefit percent as a result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing swiss tax rate 
exclusive of this one time benefit in the provision for income taxes  we were able to realize a lower effective tax rate 
the reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several european restructuring initiatives  the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing swiss tax rate from approximately percent to percent and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions  including puerto rico 
in  the successful negotiation of the lower swiss tax rate was effective for the last five months of the year  whereas in the benefit was recognized for the entire year 
net earnings increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher operating profit and decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance  offset by a higher effective tax rate

we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december   and therefore  our available borrowings were  million 
the million is in japan and carries a low interest rate  which is why we have not repaid the debt 
the senior credit facility contains a provision whereby borrowings may be increased to  million 
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a libor based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the senior credit facility  at an alternate base rate  or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process 
the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement  including  among other things  limitations on consolidations  mergers and sales of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of to and a minimum interest coverage ratio of to if we fall below an investment grade credit rating  additional restrictions would result  including restrictions on investments  payment of dividends and stock repurchases 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december  commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees  including a facility and a utilization fee 
the senior credit facility is rated bbb by standard poor s ratings services and is not rated by moody s investors service  inc we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling million

in december  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to billion through december  as of december   million of common stock had been repurchased 
we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under this program 
management believes that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary

the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions and and and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars and australian dollars or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through may the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  and  were  million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar and australian dollar usd 
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million and million for the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euros 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency translation gains losses recognized in earnings under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation are generally offset with gain losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into to month supply contracts  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

and subsidiaries form k interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
presently  we invest our cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities 
we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action  nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
