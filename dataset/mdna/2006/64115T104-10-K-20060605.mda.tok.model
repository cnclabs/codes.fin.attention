overview netscout systems  inc netscout or the company designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated products that enable performance management and optimization of complex  high speed networks  enabling delivery of critical business applications and content efficiently to end users 
we manufacture and market these products in an integrated hardware and software solution that has been used by commercial enterprises  large governmental agencies and service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products  services and licenses and royalties sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  and current economic conditions 
in fiscal year  our total revenue increased million to million compared to million in fiscal year in addition  our cost of revenue  increased by million to million compared to million in fiscal year gross profit of million  or of revenue  in fiscal year increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal year our gross margin is primarily impacted by the mix and volume of our product  service  license and royalty revenue 
we realize significantly higher gross margins on license and royalty revenue relative to product and service revenue and higher gross margins on service revenue relative to product revenue 
our operating expenses  which include research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangible and in process research and development expenses increased in fiscal year by million to million  compared to million in fiscal year primary contributors to this increase in overall expenses were a million increase in sales commissions which was mainly due to increased revenue attainment and higher attainment of sales incentive programs  a million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount  employee compensation  including incentive compensation  a  increase in stock based compensation expense mainly due to the acquisition of quantiva s business and the awarding of restricted stock units  and a  increase in marketing expenses 
net income for fiscal year increased by million to million compared to a net income of million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million that resulted from higher revenue attainment and the increase of million in interest income due to higher interest rates  partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in income tax expense of million due to higher pre tax income 
we are continuing to see significant benefit from operating leverage and remain focused on increasing our operating margin by growing revenue while containing expenses 
this is largely driven by strong year over year revenue growth of led by product revenue growth  a positive indicator of the adoption of our ngenius solution within our customer base 
in addition  we improved profitability  delivering a increase in earnings over the fiscal year ended march  we continue to see increased focus by the market and our customers on the importance of application performance monitoring from within the network 
as networks and applications become increasingly complex and web services and service oriented architectures more pervasive our products are ideally positioned for this new paradigm 
during fiscal year we released a number of new products including our important new technology initiative called high definition performance management  which provides unparalleled application traffic visibility across the enterprise 
this technology  combined with our ngenius flow recorder and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of quantiva  furthers our strategy to deliver automated analytical products to our customers 
we also introduced a new  highly scalable ngenius performance manager appliance for netflow for the cost effective monitoring and analyzing of large cisco netflow enabled network environments 
the new appliance is security hardened and dedicated to aggregating and analyzing data from large deployments of cisco s netflow routers and switches 
the ngenius performance manager appliance for netflow is available in windows or red hat linux platforms and scales to support data collected from thousands of netflow interfaces 
we also released the ngenius performance manager standby server to support our customers needs for high availability of their business networks and applications during times of crisis 
addressing large commercial enterprises and government agencies regulated requirements for business continuity  including disaster recovery  the ngenius standby server will help network administrators monitor network and application activity during a crisis by showing which systems and applications are on line  which sites and users are able to continue to conduct business  and how business services are performing on backup or redundant networks and systems 
the ngenius performance manager standby server maintains a frequently updated  replicated copy of the primary server s performance data and configuration settings so that if a primary server becomes unavailable  the administrator can quickly enable the standby server to assume control of all performance management processes 
fiscal year also featured the release of our ngenius oc packet over sonet probe for the performance management of high speed optical core networks 
the ngenius oc probe addresses wireless carriers needs for visibility into converged ip based voice  data  and video services as they deploy third generation networks 
critical accounting policies netscout considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  purchased software and internal use software  and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
netscout generally provides three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the software support is recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue related to the hardware support is recognized ratably over the month support period 
after the expiration of these initial support periods the customer may elect to purchase an extended support agreement that typically runs for an additional months 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers that incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery of the original equipment manufacturer s product has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon reported product shipments by the license holder 
multi element arrangements are customer purchases of a combination of netscout product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered element 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the purchase price is allocated to the delivered elements  generally hardware and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our standard payment terms are net days 
we monitor all accounts receivable balances of our customers and assess any collection issues as they arise 
we believe our credit policies are prudent and reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
at march   one customer accounted for of our accounts receivable balance 
at march   no one customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance 
historically  we have not experienced any significant non performance by our customers nor do we anticipate non performance by our customers in the future and  accordingly  typically we do not require collateral from our customers 
on rare occasions we will require select international customers to provide a letter of credit 
we perform credit checks on all potential new customers prior to acceptance of an order 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for possible losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make their required payments and any losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses 
as of march  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our judgments and estimates of the uncollectability of specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and customer concentrations 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
as of march  and  we recorded net realizable value adjustments of  and  respectively 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect the net realizable value 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the increase of million represents the excess purchase price paid by netscout over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired from quantiva as of april   the closing date of the acquisition 
goodwill will be reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
at times  the market capitalization of our common stock may decline temporarily below our stockholders equity  however  we do not believe that any temporary decline below our stockholders equity would necessarily indicate impairment 
if adverse economic or industry trends or decrease in customer demand result in a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period in the future  we would need to assess an impairment loss 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of other intangible assets was million and as of march  and  respectively 
we account for our other intangible assets at historical cost 
the carrying value of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis 
the company s other intangible assets include software and non compete agreements  resulting from the acquisition of quantiva s business on april  see note and note 
in process research and development was  fiscal year ended march  due to the acquisition of quantiva s business 
in process research and development was identified and valued by management with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist 
the amount assigned to in process research and development was determined by identifying the specific projects that would be continued and for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition date and which had no alternative future use 
the cost approach  as represented by time invested by quantiva programmers  was used in valuing the in process research and development 
we recognize that the income approach is the preferable valuation methodology 
however  due to the lack of a historical market for the technology  a meaningful cash flow projection could not be developed and therefore the cost approach was determined to be most appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs  purchased software and internal use software costs incurred in the research and development of netscout s products  including the various small point releases and small product enhancements that are released throughout each fiscal year  are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed and capitalized thereafter  until the related software products are available for first customer shipment 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
future major product enhancements  such as those included in our performance manager release in fiscal year  would be capitalized under the guidance of sfas no 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
netscout also capitalizes purchased software in accordance with sfas no 
as of march   capitalized software development costs were million and accumulated amortization of such costs was million  resulting in net capitalized software costs of  capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based upon anticipated future revenue for the software products and changes in product technologies 
unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the software product will be expensed in the period in which such a determination is made 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing the net realizable value of the unamortized software development costs 
if our accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  we may expense such software development costs immediately and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
during the twelve months ended march   netscout met technological feasibility for its ngenius analytics product 
capitalized costs to date include payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the project and who are working on software development tasks eligible for capitalization  such as design requirements  development  infrastructure  testing and project management 
general and administrative costs and overhead costs are not capitalized 
as of march   capitalized software development costs for the ngenius analytics product totaled  amortization of software development costs will be recorded on a straight line basis over two years once the project is ready for sale to the general public which is anticipated to be in the first quarter of fiscal year during the twelve months ended march   netscout capitalized million of purchased software obtained in connection with the acquisition of quantiva s business note 
purchased capitalized software is included on the balance sheet within other intangible assets  net 
amortization of capitalized purchased software is recorded on a straight line basis over three years from the date of the purchase 
amortization was  for the twelve months ended march  the company considered the economic consumption method alternative for amortizing these costs and determined that the straight line method was preferable given the amount of subjectivity involved in projecting the timing of cash flows related to the acquired quantiva software 
netscout is implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system in order to manage better the growth and increasing complexity of our business and to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal control over financial reporting 
certain costs that are incurred in the procurement and development of this erp system are capitalized in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
preliminary project planning costs associated with the project were expensed as incurred 
once we executed contracts with third parties and committed to develop the software system  capitalization of eligible costs began 
capitalized costs to date include fees paid for the purchase of software  fees paid to third parties to develop customizations to the software during the application development stage  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the software project and who are working on software development tasks such as design requirements  development  infrastructure  testing and project management 
general and administrative costs and overhead costs are not capitalized 
as of march   capitalized software costs relating to the erp system implementation totaled million 
amortization of internal use software will be recorded on a straight line basis over five years once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  which is currently expected to be in fiscal year income taxes netscout estimates the quarterly income tax expense based on our projected annual effective tax rate 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing netscout s projected annual effective tax rate 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
netscout recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as an acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we believe future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of  of federal net operating loss carryforwards and  of federal research and development tax credits  which begin to expire in fiscal year  and million of other temporary book and tax accounting differences note 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments and us treasury bills 
netscout s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents 
netscout s exposure to interest rates based on outstanding debt has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that we currently have a million line of credit with million of letters of credit secured against it and we have no amounts outstanding under the line and no other outstanding interest bearing debt 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been limited 
all revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
netscout pays for certain foreign operating expenses such as foreign payroll  rent and office expense in foreign currency and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in the period incurred
